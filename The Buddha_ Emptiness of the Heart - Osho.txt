OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
BUKKO	SAID:
TAKING	 THINGS	 EASILY	 AND	 WITHOUT	 FORCING,	 AFTER	 SOME
TIME	THE
RUSH	 OF	 THOUGHT,	 OUTWARD	 AND	 INWARD,	 SUBSIDES
NATURALLY,	AND
THE	TRUE	FACE	SHOWS	ITSELF.
...	NOW	BODY	AND	MIND,	FREE	FROM	ALL	MOTIVATIONS,	ALWAYS
APPEAR	AS	VOID	AND	ABSOLUTE	SAMENESS,	SHINING	LIKE	THE
BRIGHTNESS	OF	HEAVEN,	AT	 THE	CENTER	OF	 THE	VAST	 EXPANSE
OF
PHENOMENAL	 THINGS,	 AND	 NEEDING	 NO	 POLISHING	 OR
CLEANING.	THIS
IS	BEYOND	ALL	CONCEPTS,	BEYOND	BEING	AND	NON-BEING.
LEAVE	YOUR	INNUMERABLE	KNOWINGS	AND	SEEINGS	AND
UNDERSTANDINGS,	AND	GO	TO	THAT	GREATNESS	OF	SPACE.	WHEN
YOU
COME	 TO	 THAT	VASTNESS,	 THERE	 IS	 NO	 SPECK	OF	 BUDDHISM	 IN
YOUR
HEART,	 AND	WHEN	 THERE	 IS	 NO	 SPECK	 OF	 KNOWLEDGE	 ABOUT
YOU,	YOU
WILL	HAVE	THE	TRUE	SIGHT	OF	BUDDHAS	AND	PATRIARCHS.
THE	 TRUE	 NATURE	 IS	 LIKE	 THE	 IMMENSITY	 OF	 SPACE	 WHICH
CONTAINS
ALL	 THINGS.	 WHEN	 YOU	 CAN	 GO	 AND	 COME	 IN	 ALL	 REGIONS
EQUALLY,	WHEN	THERE	IS	NOTHING	SPECIALLY	YOURS,	NO	WITHIN
AND	NO
WITHOUT,	WHEN	YOU	CONFORM	TO	HIGH	AND	CONFORM	TO	LOW,
CONFORM	TO	THE	SQUARE	AND	CONFORM	TO	THE	ROUND,	THAT	IS
IT.
THE	 EMPTINESS	 OF	 THE	 SEA	 ALLOWS	 WAVES	 TO	 RISE;	 THE
EMPTINESS	OF
THE	MOUNTAIN	VALLEY	MAKES	THE	VOICE	ECHO;	THE	EMPTINESS
OF	THE
HEART	 MAKES	 THE	 BUDDHA.	 WHEN	 YOU	 EMPTY	 THE	 HEART,
THINGS
APPEAR	AS	IN	A	MIRROR,	SHINING	THERE	WITHOUT	DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN	 THEM.	 LIFE	 AND	 DEATH	 AN	 ILLUSION,	 ALL	 THE
BUDDHAS	ARE
ONE'S	OWN	BODY.
ZEN	 IS	 NOT	 SOMETHING	 MYSTERIOUS;	 IT	 IS	 JUST	 HITTING	 AND
PIERCING
THROUGH.	 IF	 YOU	 CUT	 OFF	 ALL	 DOUBTS,	 THE	 COURSE	 OF	 LIFE-
AND-DEATH	IS	CUT	OFF	NATURALLY.	 I	ASK	YOU	ALL:	DO	YOU	SEE
IT	OR	DON'T
YOU?	--	HOW	IN	JUNE	THE	SNOW	MELTS	FROM	THE	TOP	OF	MOUNT
FUJI.
Maneesha,	Bukko	has	come	to	the	ultimate	expression	of	the	experience	of	one's
own	being.	Very	rarely	has	a	master	succeeded	to	such	a	point	as	Bukko	has	in
his	statements.
Listen	carefully,	because	rarely	will	you	meet	a	Bukko	again.
BUKKO	SAID:
TAKING	 THINGS	 EASILY	 AND	 WITHOUT	 FORCING,	 AFTER	 SOME
TIME	THE
RUSH	 OF	 THOUGHT,	 OUTWARD	 AND	 INWARD,	 SUBSIDES
NATURALLY,	AND
THE	TRUE	FACE	SHOWS	ITSELF.
That's	what	I	have	been	telling	you.	To	be	a	buddha	is	not	a	difficult	job.	It	is	not
some	achievement	for	which	you	need	a	Nobel	Prize.	It	is	the	easiest	thing	in	the
world,	because	it	has	already	happened	without	your	knowing.
The	 buddha	 is	 already	 breathing	 in	 you.	 Just	 a	 little	 recognition,	 just	 a	 little
turning	inwards...	and	that	has	not	to	be	done	forcibly.	If	you	do	it	forcibly	you
will	miss	 the	point.	 It	 is	 very	delicate.	You	have	 to	 look	 inward	playfully,	 not
seriously.	That's	what	 he	means	 by	 "taking	 things	 easily."	Don't	 take	 anything
seriously.
Existence	is	very	easy.	You	have	got	your	life	without	any	effort,	you	are	living
your	 life	 without	 any	 effort.	 You	 are	 breathing	 perfectly	 well	 without	 being
reminded;	 your	 heartbeat	 continues	 even	 in	 your	 sleep	 --	 so	 easy	 is	 existence
with	you!	But	you	are	not	so	easy	with	existence.	You	are	very	close-fisted.	You
want	everything	to	be	turned	into	an	achievement.
Enlightenment	cannot	be	an	achievement.	That	which	you	have	already	--	how
can	it	be	an	achievement?	The	authentic	master	simply	takes	away	things	which
you	 don't	 have	 and	 you	 believe	 you	 have,	 and	 he	 gives	 you	 that	 which	 you
already	have.	You	are	having	many	things	which	you	don't	have	at	all,	you	just
believe	that	you	have	them.	The	master's	function	is	that	of	a	surgeon,	to	cut	all
that	is	not	you	and	leave	behind	just	the	essential	core	--	the	eternal	being.
It	is	a	very	easy	phenomenon;	you	can	do	it	on	your	own.	There	are	no	problems
and	no	risk	in	taking	things	easily,	but	people	take	things	very	tensely.	They	take
things	very	seriously,	and	that	spoils	the	whole	game.
And	 remember,	 life	 is	 a	 game.	 Once	 you	 understand	 it	 as	 a	 game,	 a	 deep
playfulness	arises	on	its	own	accord.	The	victory	is	not	the	point;	the	point	is	to
play	totally,	joyously,	dancingly.
What	is	called	playfulness	is	very	essential	in	the	inquiry	of	your	own	being.
TAKING	 THINGS	 EASILY,	 SAYS	 BUKKO,	 AND	 WITHOUT	 FORCING,
AFTER
SOME	 TIME	 THE	 RUSH	 OF	 THOUGHT,	 OUTWARD	 AND	 INWARD,
SUBSIDES
NATURALLY,	AND	THE	TRUE	FACE	SHOWS	ITSELF.
When	 I	 say	 to	 you	 that	 meditation	 is	 nothing	 but	 thoughtlessness,	 you	 can
misunderstand	me.	You	are	not	 to	do	anything	 to	become	 thoughtless,	because
whatever	 you	 will	 do	 will	 be	 again	 a	 thought.	 You	 have	 to	 learn	 to	 see	 the
procession	of	thoughts,	standing	by	the	side	of	the	road	as	if	it	does	not	matter	to
you	what	is	passing	by.	Just	the	ordinary	traffic
--	 if	 you	 can	 take	 your	 thoughts	 in	 such	 a	manner	 that	 they	 are	 not	 of	much
concern,	 then	 easily,	 slowly,	 the	 caravan	 of	 thoughts	 which	 has	 continued	 for
thousands	of	years	disappears.
You	 have	 to	 understand	 a	 simple	 thing,	 that	 giving	 attention	 is	 giving
nourishment.	 If	 you	 don't	 give	 any	 attention	 but	 remain	 unconcerned,	 the
thoughts	start	dying	on	their	own.
They	don't	have	any	other	way	to	get	energy,	any	other	source	of	 life.	You	are
their	energy,	and	because	you	go	on	giving	them	attention,	seriously,	you	think	it
is	very	difficult	to	be	free	from	thought.	It	is	the	easiest	thing	in	the	world,	but	it
has	to	be	done	in	the	right	way.
The	right	way	is	just	to	stand	by	the	side.	The	traffic	goes	on	--	let	it	go.	Don't
make	any	 judgment	of	good	and	bad;	don't	 appreciate,	don't	 condemn.	That	 is
what	is	meant	by	being	easy.	It	is	all	okay.
WITHOUT	 FORCING...	 and	 that	 is	 something	 that	 has	 to	 be	 remembered,
because	our	natural	tendency	is	that	if	we	have	to	become	thoughtless,	why	not
force	the	thoughts?
Why	not	 throw	 them	out?	But	by	 the	very	act	of	 forcing	 them,	you	are	giving
them	energy,	you	are	giving	them	nourishment,	you	are	taking	note	of	them	and
you	are	making	them	important	--	so	important	that	without	throwing	them,	you
cannot	meditate.
Just	try	to	throw	out	any	single	thought,	and	you	will	see	how	difficult	it	is.	The
more	you	throw	it	the	more	it	bounces	back!	It	will	enjoy	the	game	very	much,
and	you	are	going	to	be	defeated	finally.	You	have	taken	a	wrong	route.
I	have	always	told	an	ancient	Tibetan	story....
A	 young	man	was	 very	much	 interested	 in	 the	 esoteric,	 in	 the	mysterious.	He
found	a	saint	who	was	known	to	have	many	secrets,	but	it	was	very	difficult	to
get	any	secret	from	him.	The	young	man	said,	"I	will	see.	I	will	devote	my	whole
life	to	his	service,	and	I	will	get	the	secrets,	the	mysteries."
So	he	remained	with	the	old	saint.	The	old	saint	told	him,	"You	are	unnecessarily
wasting	your	 time.	 I	don't	have	anything,	 I	 am	 just	 a	poor	old	 soul.	Because	 I
don't	speak,	people	think	I	am	keeping	some	secret.	But	I	don't	have	anything	to
say,	so	I	remain	silent."
But	the	man	said,	"I	cannot	be	persuaded	so	easily.	You	will	have	to	give	me	the
secret	which	opens	the	door	of	all	the	mysteries."
Tired	of	the	young	man,	because	twenty-four	hours	a	day	he	was	there...	the	poor
old	saint	had	 to	arrange	for	his	 food,	had	 to	ask	somebody	 to	 take	care	 for	his
clothes;	the	winter	was	coming	and	he	would	need	more	clothes.	It	had	become	a
burden.	Finally	the	old	man	got	fed	up.	He	told	the	young	fellow,	"Today	I	am
going	to	tell	you	the	secret.	It	is	not	very	difficult.	It	is	very	simple."
In	 Tibet	 there	 is	 a	 common	 mantra	 which	 religious	 people	 repeat:	 Om	 mani
padme	hum.
He	said,	"Everything	is	hidden	in	this."
But	the	young	man	said,	"Don't	befool	me!	Everybody	knows	this	mantra,	it	 is
not	a	secret.	It	is	the	most	widely	known	mantra	to	the	Tibetans."
He	 said,	 "It	 is	 true,	 it	 is	widely	known.	But	 the	key	 is	 not	 known	 to	 them	 for
opening	it.
Do	you	know	the	key	for	opening	it?"
The	 young	man	 said,	 "Key?	 I	 have	 never	 heard	 that	 there	 is	 a	 key	 to	 open	 a
mantra."
"That	is	the	secret!	The	key	is,	while	you	are	repeating	the	mantra	--	just	for	five
minutes
--	just	don't	let	any	monkey	pop	into	your	head."
He	said,	"You	seem	to	be	an	old	idiot!	In	my	whole	life	I	have	never	thought	of	a
monkey.	Why	should	I	think	of	one?"
He	rushed	down	the	stairs	of	the	temple	where	the	old	saint	lived.	But	strangely,
even	though	he	was	not	reciting	the	mantra,	monkeys	started	coming,	giggling.
He	would	close	his	eyes	and	they	would	be	there.	He	would	run	to	this	side	and
they	would	be	there.
They	were	not	outside,	they	were	inside	his	head.	And	slowly	slowly	the	crowd
was	becoming	bigger.	As	far	as	he	could	see,	only	monkeys	and	monkeys,	and
doing	all	kinds	of	circus!
He	 said,	 "My	 god,	 this	 is	 the	 key?	 I	 am	 finished!	 I	 have	 not	 even	 started	 the
mantra."
Finally	he	said,	"Let	me	take	a	good	bath	and	get	rid	of	all	these	monkeys."	But
the	more	he	pushed	them	away,	the	more	they	jumped	towards	him.	He	took	the
bath,	he	burned	incense,	he	sat	in	a	religious	lotus	posture,	but	whatever	he	was
doing,	 monkeys	 were	 watching	 from	 every	 side.	 He	 said,	 "It	 is	 strange	 --
monkeys	have	never	visited	this	house..."	The	whole	night	he	tried,	but	he	could
not	 repeat	 this	 simple	mantra	Om	mani	padme	hum	without	monkeys	 jumping
in.
By	the	morning	he	was	so	tired.	He	said,	"This	old	saint,	I	will	kill	him!	What
kind	of	key...?"	In	the	morning	he	rushed	to	the	old	saint	and	said,	"Please	take
away	your	key.	I	am	almost	mad!"
The	old	man	said,	"That's	why	I	was	not	telling	anybody,	because	the	key	is	very
difficult.	Now	do	you	understand	why	I	was	silent?"
He	said,	"I	don't	want	to	listen	to	a	single	word	from	you.	You	just	take	this	key
back	and	let	me	go	home.	And	I	don't	want	these	monkeys	to	follow	me!"
The	 saint	 said,	 "If	 you	 give	 back	 the	 key,	 never	 repeat	 the	mantra	 again.	 The
monkeys	will	come!	I	cannot	help	it,	they	are	not	in	my	power."
The	man	dropped	the	mantra,	he	dropped	the	key.	He	descended	the	same	steps
and	there	was	no	monkey	at	all.	He	closed	his	eyes	and	there	was	no	monkey.	He
looked	all	around	and	there	was	no	monkey.	He	said,	"It	 is	strange..."	He	 tried
just	once	on	the	way,	to	see	what	happens	when	he	says	Om	mani	padme	hum
and	closes	his	eyes.	And	they	were	all	coming,	from	all	directions!
You	cannot	repress	any	thought.	The	very	repressive	process	gives	it	energy,	life,
strength.	 And	 it	 weakens	 you	 because	 you	 become	 a	 defeated	 partner	 in	 the
game.	 The	 easiest	 thing	 is	 not	 to	 force	 but	 to	 be	 just	 a	 witness.	 If	 a	monkey
comes,	let	him	come.
Just	say	"Hello!"	and	he	will	go.	But	don't	tell	him	to	go.	Just	be	a	witness	that	a
monkey	has	come,	or	a	thousand	monkeys	have	come.	What	does	it	matter?	It	is
none	 of	 your	 business.	 They	may	 be	 going	 to	 some	 gathering,	 some	 religious
festival,	 so	 let	 them	 go.	 It	 is	 none	 of	 your	 concern.	And	 soon	 the	 crowd	will
disappear,	seeing	that	"the	man	is	not	interested."
All	your	thoughts	are	in	the	same	category.	Never	force	any	thought	to	go	away;
otherwise	it	will	rebound	with	greater	energy.	And	the	energy	is	yours!	You	are
on	 a	 self-defeating	 track.	 The	more	 you	 throw	 it	 away	 the	more	 it	 will	 come
back.
Hence,	 what	 Bukko	 is	 saying	 is	 the	 only	 way	 --	 I	 say	 the	 only	 way	 --	 to	 be
thoughtless:	 don't	 pay	 any	 attention.	 Just	 remain	 silently	watching	 all	 kinds	of
things...	 monkeys	 and	 elephants,	 let	 them	 pass.	 Soon	 you	 will	 find	 an	 empty
road,	 and	 when	 you	 find	 an	 empty	 road,	 you	 have	 found	 an	 empty	 mind	 --
naturally.	Everything	outward	and	inward	subsides	and	there	is	 the	tremendous
silence	which	easiness	brings.
NOW	 BODY	 AND	 MIND,	 FREE	 FROM	 ALL	 MOTIVATIONS,	 ALWAYS
APPEAR
AS	VOID	AND	ABSOLUTE	SAMENESS.
When	you	are	in	the	state	of	no-mind,	which	is	equivalent	to	thoughtlessness...
when	there	is	no	thought	cloud	moving	in	your	mind,	you	attain	to	the	clarity	of
no-mind.
Mind	is	simply	a	combination	of	all	the	thoughts,	of	all	the	clouds.	Mind	has	no
independent	 nature	 of	 its	 own.	When	 all	 the	 thoughts	 are	 gone	 and	 the	 sky	 is
clean	 and	 clear,	 you	 will	 see	 that	 everything	 that	 you	 have	 paid	 so	 much
attention	 to	 is	 nothing	 but	 emptiness.	 Your	 thoughts	 were	 all	 empty.	 They
contained	nothing,	they	were	void.
Whatever	 you	 thought	 they	 contained	 was	 your	 own	 energy.	 You	 have
withdrawn	 your	 energy	 --	 just	 the	 empty	 shell	 of	 the	 thought	 falls	 down.	You
have	withdrawn	your	identity	and	immediately	the	thought	is	no	longer	alive.	It
was	your	identity	that	was	giving	it	life	force.
And	strangely	enough,	you	 thought	 that	your	 thoughts	were	very	 strong	and	 it
was	 difficult	 to	 get	 rid	 of	 them!	 You	 were	 making	 them	 strong,	 you	 were
cultivating	them.
Just	by	forcing	them,	you	were	getting	into	a	fix.
I	agree	with	Bukko.	I	have	agreed	out	of	my	own	experience	that	you	can	simply
sit	or	lie	down	and	let	the	thoughts	pass	by.	They	will	not	leave	even	a	trace.	Just
don't	 get	 interested...	 and	 don't	 be	 DISinterested	 either,	 just	 be	 neutral.	 To	 be
neutral	is	to	be	easy,	and	to	be	neutral	is	to	take	back	the	very	life	force	that	you
have	given	to	your	thoughts.
Suddenly,	a	man	of	no	thought	becomes	so	full	of	energy	--	energy	which	he	had
spread	into	the	thoughts	unnecessarily.	He	was	weak	because	he	was	nourishing
thoughts,	which	 leads	nowhere.	They	promise	--	 thoughts	are	politicians.	They
promise	great	 things	to	come,	but	 the	moment	 they	have	power,	 they	forget	all
their	promises.	This	has	been	going	on	for	centuries.
Those	 promises	 are	 just	 seductive.	 Your	 thoughts	 are	 promising	 you	 many
things:	 "You	can	be	 this,	you	can	be	 that."	And	 they	drive	you,	 they	give	you
motivation	to	become	the	greatest	leader	in	the	world,	to	become	the	richest	man
in	the	world.	They	drive	you	into	ambitions,	they	become	your	masters.	It	is	one
of	 the	 weirdest	 phenomena	 that	 the	 servants	 become	 masters,	 and	 the	 master
becomes	 just	a	servant.	The	moment	you	take	your	energy	back	you	become	a
tremendous	force,	gathered	in	your	own	being	and	center.
This	 is	 the	 first	 and	 the	 most	 important	 thing	 to	 understand:	 never	 force
anything,	just	let	it	go	easily.	If	you	ever	want	to	find	out	what	the	secret	of	your
life	 is,	 then	you	have	 to	go	 inwards.	And	 thoughts	are	always	going	outwards;
every	thought	takes	you	outwards.
When	all	thoughts	cease,	there	is	nowhere	to	go	--	you	simply	are	at	home.
This	at-homeness	is	meditation.
Utter	silence	and	peace	prevails.
In	 this	 silence	 every	 ambition	 seems	 to	 be	 stupid;	 the	whole	world	 of	 objects
seems	 to	 be	 nothing	 but	 a	 dream.	 And	 your	 own	 being	 shines	 in	 its
BRIGHTNESS	OF	HEAVEN,	AT
THE	CENTER	OF	THE	VAST	EXPANSE	OF	PHENOMENAL	THINGS,	AND
NEEDING	NO	POLISHING	OR	CLEANING.
Your	own	being	 is	 so	pure,	 so	unpolluted,	not	even	a	particle	of	dust	has	ever
reached	 there	 --	 cannot	 reach.	 Only	 your	 consciousness	 can	 reach	 there,	 and
consciousness	 arises	 in	 you	 with	 no-mind.	 With	 no-mind	 you	 become	 so
wakeful,	so	watchful	--	nowhere	to	go	outside,	because	all	thoughts	are	gone.	So
you	turn	inwards,	and	for	the	first	time	face	your	own	original	being.
THIS	IS	BEYOND	ALL	CONCEPTS...
What	you	are	going	to	face	in	your	meditation	is	beyond	all	concepts.
This	is	a	very	pregnant	statement.
...	 BEYOND	 BEING	 AND	 NON-BEING.	 We	 are	 using	 the	 word	 `being'
because	you	will	not	be	able	 to	understand,	while	your	 thoughts	are	 there,	 that
something	beyond	being	and	beyond	non-being	 is	 in	existence	within	you.	But
when	thoughts	are	gone,	the	first	encounter	is	with	a	being,	an	individual	being,
bright	and	clean.	And	as	you	enter	 this	being,	you	 find	yourself	going	beyond
your	individuality	into	the	universal,	which	is	beyond	being	and	non-being.
This	 is	 what	 ultimate	 enlightenment	 is.	 And	 Bukko	 has	 put	 it	 in	 the	 simplest
possible	way.
LEAVE	YOUR	INNUMERABLE	KNOWINGS	AND	SEEINGS	AND
UNDERSTANDINGS,	AND	GO	TO	THAT	GREATNESS	OF	SPACE.	WHEN
YOU
COME	 TO	 THAT	VASTNESS,	 THERE	 IS	 NO	 SPECK	OF	 BUDDHISM	 IN
YOUR
HEART.
He	is	really	a	great	master.	His	love	towards	Buddha	is	great,	but	that	does	not
mean	that	he	is	a	follower	of	Buddha.	He	is	saying	that	when	you	enter	into	this
great	space,	you	will	not	find	anything	--	NO	SPECK	OF	BUDDHISM	even	in
your	heart.	AND	WHEN
THERE	IS	NO	SPECK	OF	KNOWLEDGE	ABOUT	YOU	--	you	will	not	know
anything,	 even	 about	 yourself	 --	 YOU	WILL	 HAVE	 THE	 TRUE	 SIGHT	OF
THE
BUDDHAS	and	the	great	masters.
Buddha	 himself	 had	 a	 great	 difficulty.	 Perhaps	 no	 man	 has	 had	 such	 a	 great
difficulty	 in	explaining	his	experience.	 In	 this	country,	 the	self,	atma,	has	been
considered	to	be	the	ultimate	experience.	The	two	other	religions	of	this	country,
Hinduism	and	Jainism,	have	both	emphasized	that	to	know	your	self	is	all,	there
is	nothing	beyond	it.	Now,	Buddha	was	going	against	all	of	India's	traditions	by
saying	that	the	self	is	only	a	door	to	no-self.
Don't	stop	at	the	door,	it	is	a	bridge	to	be	passed.	Don't	make	your	house	on	the
bridge	because	a	vaster	universe	is	ready	to	welcome	you	if	you	can	leave	this
small	idea	of	your	self.
What	 is	 this	self	 that	you	carry,	 that	all	 the	 traditions	of	 this	country	and	other
countries	think	so	much	of?	Hundreds	of	philosophers	came	to	Gautam	Buddha,
saying,	 "What	 you	 are	 saying	 goes	 against	 the	 VEDAS,	 against	 the
UPANISHADS."
He	said,	"What	can	I	do?	It	is	my	own	experience,	I	cannot	deny	it.	The	self	has
to	be	 transcended;	only	 then	you	become	one	with	 the	universe.	The	dewdrop
has	to	disappear	into	the	ocean."
Why	cling	to	the	dewdrop?
What	are	you	gaining	by	it?
Have	 you	 ever	 observed?	 --	 all	 the	 religions	 teach	 that	 you	 should	 liberate
yourself	from	misery,	from	sin.	You	should	earn	virtue	so	that	you	can	make	a
place	in	paradise.	"You"
are	the	center	of	all	the	religions	--	but	not	of	Zen.
All	 the	religions	say,	"Liberate	yourself	 from	your	attachments."	Only	Zen	has
the	strange	courage	to	say,	"Liberate	yourself	from	yourself!"	Liberating	yourself
from	your	attachments	is	child's	play.	The	real,	authentic	seeker	finally	liberates
himself	not	only	from	other	things	but	even	from	himself.	He	drops	the	very	idea
that	Ì	am'.
Existence	is.
Looked	 at	 from	 this	 viewpoint,	 it	 can	 be	 said	 that	 you	 are	 the	 center	 of	 all
misery.	And	however	you	try,	you	will	find	you	are	only	changing	misery,	from
one	misery	to	another	misery.	Maybe	in	the	gap	you	feel	a	little	light.	From	one
marriage	to	another	marriage	--
just	in	the	meantime,	while	you	have	to	wait,	you	feel	good.	But	this	goodness	is
not	going	to	last,	you	are	already	filling	in	the	form	for	another	marriage.
You	are	the	problem.
All	other	problems	are	just	your	children	--	a	bus	load	of	children,	and	you	are
the	driver.
Buddhism,	particularly,	introduced	the	idea	that	it	is	not	a	question	of	dropping
this	greed,	that	anger,	this	passion,	that	possession.	The	question	is	of	dropping
yourself	completely,	disappearing	into	the	universal	energy	from	where	we	have
arisen.
In	India,	Buddha	was	not	understood.	I	am	experiencing	the	same	thing.	In	India
I	am	not	understood,	because	India	has,	for	ten	thousand	years	or	more,	believed
in	the	self	as	the	ultimate	value.
Self	is	not	the	ultimate	value.	What	are	you	going	to	do	with	the	self	when	you
find	it?
Just	sitting	stupidly,	 looking	weird	to	everybody.	Just	for	a	moment	 think:	You
have	found	your	self,	now	what	are	you	going	to	do?	And	remember,	once	you
have	 found	 it,	 you	cannot	 escape	 from	 it.	 It	 clings	 like	German	glue!	 It	 is	 not
Indian	glue....
Buddha	 took	 a	 tremendous	 step	 in	 the	 world	 of	 consciousness	 when	 he	 said,
"The	self	is	only	a	stepping	stone.	Step	beyond	it!	And	going	beyond	it,	you	are
just	empty."
But	 this	 "empty"	 is	 not	 nothingness.	 The	 word	 that	 Buddha	 used	 has	 been
translated	either	as	"emptiness"	or	as	"nothingness,"	but	 in	English	both	words
have	a	negative	connotation.	Buddha's	word	was	shunyata.	 It	 is	not	a	negative
phenomenon.
Bukko	 gives	 it	 perhaps	 the	 best	 expression	 I	 have	 come	 across:	WHEN	YOU
CAN	GO	AND	COME	IN	ALL	REGIONS	EQUALLY,	WHEN	THERE
IS	 NOTHING	 SPECIALLY	 YOURS,	 NO	WITHIN,	 NO	WITHOUT,	WHEN
YOU
CONFORM	 TO	 HIGH	 AND	 CONFORM	 TO	 LOW,	 CONFORM	 TO	 THE
SQUARE
AND	CONFORM	TO	THE	ROUND,	THAT	IS	IT.
When	 you	 are	 simply	 available,	 with	 no	 self,	 you	 don't	 have	 any	 boundaries
anymore.
Without	boundaries	you	can	conform	to	anything.
THE	EMPTINESS	OF	THE	SEA	ALLOWS	WAVES	TO	RISE...
And	your	emptiness	will	also	allow	waves	of	blissfulness,	peacefulness,	splendor
and	unknown	glory.	You	are	at	the	highest	peak	available	to	any	consciousness.
But	all	these	are	still	waves	according	to	Bukko.	That's	why	I	say	he	has	made	a
great	statement.
THE	 EMPTINESS	 OF	 THE	 SEA	 ALLOWS	 WAVES	 TO	 RISE;	 THE
EMPTINESS	OF
THE	MOUNTAIN	VALLEY	MAKES	THE	VOICE	ECHO...
It	is	empty;	otherwise	how	can	it	echo	the	voice?
Just	nearby	in	Matheran,	there	is	an	echo	point.	A	very	clear	echo	point	--	I	have
seen	 other	 echo	 points	 in	 other	 mountains	 also.	 Whatever	 you	 say	 it	 simply
repeats,	 the	whole	valley.	 If	you	bark	 like	a	dog,	 the	whole	valley	barks	 like	a
dog.	If	you	sing	a	song,	the	whole	valley	sings	the	song.	Its	emptiness	allows	it
to	conform	to	anything.
And	Bukko	is	saying	that	when	you	are	utterly	empty	of	being	and	no-being,	of
mind	and	no-mind...	When	you	are	just	merged	into	the	universal	it	can	be	said
from	one	side	that	you	are	empty,	but	from	the	other	side	you	are	so	full	that	now
you	can	conform	to	anything.	You	can	be	the	moon,	you	can	be	the	rose,	you	can
be	the	clouds.	Or	you	can	just	remain	the	empty	sky.
For	the	first	 time	you	are	free	to	be	anything	you	want.	For	 the	first	 time	your
emptiness	allows	you	to	experience	existence	from	different	angles.
It	 is	a	vast	phenomenon.	We	know	only	small	parts	of	 it	because	our	self-ness
creates	a	boundary.	We	cannot	go	beyond	the	boundary.
THE	EMPTINESS	OF	THE	HEART	MAKES	THE	BUDDHA.
Once	your	heart	is	empty,	you	are	the	buddha	--	serene,	silent,	utterly	blissful,	at
home.
When	I	say	 to	you	 that	you	are	a	buddha,	 I	mean	 it.	 It	 is	 just	 that	you	have	 to
recover	 from	 your	 dreams,	 afflictions,	 addictions.	 You	 just	 have	 to	 penetrate
deeply	to	the	point	where	even	the	self	starts	disappearing	and	the	door	opens	to
the	 vast,	 to	 the	 infinite.	 To	 be	 a	 buddha	 is	 the	 ultimate	 experience	 of	 joy,	 of
eternity,	of	immortality,	freedom	and	liberation.
And	nobody	else	can	do	it	for	you.	It	is	simple:	you	have	to	do	it	yourself.
WHEN	YOU	EMPTY	THE	HEART,	THINGS	APPEAR	AS	 IN	A	MIRROR,
SHINING
THERE	WITHOUT	DIFFERENCES	BETWEEN	THEM.	LIFE	AND	DEATH
AN
ILLUSION,	ALL	THE	BUDDHAS	ARE	ONE'S	OWN	BODY.
ZEN	 IS	 NOT	 SOMETHING	 MYSTERIOUS;	 IT	 IS	 JUST	 HITTING	 AND
PIERCING
THROUGH.
I	am	reminded...	A	great	 industrialist	had	 imported	a	 totally	new,	sophisticated
machine.
It	worked	so	beautifully,	a	hundred	times	more	productive	than	the	older	one,	but
one	day	it	stopped.	Nobody	knew	what	to	do.
The	manufacturers	were	informed,	and	they	said,	"We	can	send	our	man.	But	his
fee	is	ten	thousand	dollars	plus	all	traveling	expenses."
The	industrialist	was	losing	thousands	of	dollars	every	day.	He	agreed;	he	said,
"Send	him	immediately,	right	now."	The	man	came	from	the	airport	and	without
wasting	a	single	moment,	he	took	from	his	handbag	a	small	hammer	and	hit	the
machine	at	a	certain	point	and	it	started	working.
The	owner	of	the	factory	said,	"But	this	is	too	much!	Ten	thousand	dollars	just
for	hitting	it	with	this	little	hammer?"
The	expert	 said,	 "No,	 for	hitting	with	 the	hammer	 just	one	dollar	will	do.	The
real	thing	is	knowing	where	to	hit."
It	is	true,	ZEN	IS	NOT	SOMETHING	MYSTERIOUS.
IT	IS	JUST	HITTING	AND	PIERCING	THROUGH.
But	don't	believe	in	Bukko.	The	point	is	where	to	hit.	It	is	not	mysterious,	but	the
problem	is	where	 to	hit.	Once	you	hit	at	 the	 right	 time,	at	 the	 right	place,	 it	 is
really	very	simple;	there	is	nothing	mysterious	about	it.
That's	what	 I	 have	been	 continuously	 trying	 to	get	 you	 to	 experience,	 because
there	is	no	way	to	tell	you	where	to	hit.	Everybody	has	to	find	the	place	by	going
deeper	 into	 himself,	 seeing	 where	 the	 light	 is	 coming	 from,	 where	 the	 life	 is
coming	from,	and	then	moving	in	that	direction	without	any	fear.	This	is	what	he
means	by	"hitting	and	piercing	through."
Then	don't	stop.	It	will	be	very	beautiful.	Even	in	the	beginning,	the	moment	you
see	your	light,	your	life	source,	it	will	have	a	tremendous	beauty	and	there	will
be	a	desire	to	stop,	that	you	have	arrived.	Don't	do	that.	Much	more	lies	ahead.
Until	you	are	finished	completely...	when	you	look	all	around	and	you	don't	find
yourself	--	that	is	the	goal.
This	beyond	is	the	buddha.
IF	YOU	CUT	OFF	ALL	DOUBTS,	THE	COURSE	OF	LIFE-AND-DEATH	IS
CUT
OFF	NATURALLY.
I	ASK	YOU	ALL:	DO	YOU	SEE	IT	OR	DON'T	YOU?	--	HOW	IN	JUNE	THE
SNOW
MELTS	FROM	THE	TOP	OF	MOUNT	FUJI.
He	 is	saying	 that	 just	as	 in	June	 the	snow	starts	melting	 from	Mount	Fuji...	 so
simply,	without	making	any	fuss.	As	June	comes,	the	snow	does	not	say,	"Wait	a
little,	 I	 am	 engaged	 in	 something	 else	 and	 I	 have	 to	 wait	 a	 little."	 No	 --	 no
resistance,	no	delaying,	no	postponing.	As	June	comes,	the	snow	starts	melting.
So	when	you	 reach	 to	 the	point	where	you	 feel,	 "this	 is	my	center,"	 then	 start
melting.
Your	 June	 has	 come.	 Then	 start	 melting	 and	 disappearing.	 Your	 very
disappearance	is	making	you	the	whole	universe.
Buddha	has	said,	"When	I	disappeared,	I	saw	stars	within	me,	sun	rising,	sunset,
full-moon	nights	--	everything	within	me,	not	without	me.	It	was	my	boundary
that	had	been	keeping	them	out.	Now	the	boundary	is	no	more;	everything	has
fallen	in.	Now	I	am	the	whole."
At	the	time	of	his	death	the	Zen	monk,	Guin,	wrote:
ALL	DOCTRINES	SPLIT	ASUNDER
ZEN	TEACHING	CAST	AWAY	--
FOURSCORE	YEARS	AND	ONE.
THE	SKY	NOW	CRACKS	AND	FALLS
THE	EARTH	CLEAVES	OPEN	--
IN	THE	HEART	OF	THE	FIRE
LIES	A	HIDDEN	SPRING.
When	all	 is	dropping	and	disappearing,	 in	the	heart	of	all	 this	disappearance	is
hidden	your	spring.	From	this	point	you	will	start	growing	new	flowers	that	you
have	never	seen	before.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
IN	THE	WEST,	THEY	SAY	THAT	LOVE	--	TWO	FULL	HEARTS	--	MAKES
THE
WORLD	 GO	 ROUND.	 JUDGING	 BY	 THE	 CASUALTY	 RATE,	 FULL
HEARTS
DON'T	SEEM	TO	BE	THE	ANSWER.
WHAT	IS	THE	WORLD	OF	THE	EMPTY	HEART	OF	ZEN?
In	 the	 first	 place,	whatever	 is	 said	 in	 the	West,	 that	 "love	 --	 two	 full	 hearts	 --
makes	 the	world	 go	 round"	 is	 all	 nonsense.	Whether	 you	 are	 here	 or	 not,	 the
world	will	continue	to	go	round.
And	two	hearts	full	of	love...	where	are	you	going	to	find	them?
The	world	would	have	stopped	long	ago	if	it	were	dependent	on	two	hearts	full
of	love.
Even	to	find	one	heart	is	very	difficult;	two	is	too	much!	But	those	are	just	mass-
mind	oriented	proverbs,	not	statements	of	a	man	like	Bukko.
When	 Bukko	 says	 the	 empty	 heart	 is	 the	 buddha,	 he	 is	 talking	 about	 a	 very
authentic	experience.	And	it	does	not	depend	on	anybody	else.
Love	 is	both,	a	 joy	and	a	misery,	because	 two	are	 involved.	Wherever	 there	 is
duality,	there	is	going	to	be	conflict.	You	can	put	the	conflict	aside	for	a	few	days
on	the	honeymoon,	but	after	 the	honeymoon	the	conflict	arises	on	every	point.
What	kind	of	curtains?	 --	 and	 immediately	 there	are	 two	voices.	What	kind	of
carpets,	and	what	kind	of	literature,	what	kind	of	furniture?	On	every	point	you
will	 find	 that	 those	 great	 lovers	 are	 in	 absolute	 disagreement!	 There	 is	 the
beginning	of	real	love,	which	always	ends	in	divorce.
The	world	of	religion	is	not	 the	world	of	duality.	It	 is	a	world	of	oneness.	You
have	to	find	your	own	heart,	utterly	empty,	empty	of	all	rubbish.	And	when	your
heart	is	empty	of	all	rubbish,	you	are	the	buddha.	There	is	no	other	experience
which	goes	beyond	it.
Now	before	you	become	buddhas,	a	few	laughs,	because	a	few	may	come	back,
a	 few	may	not	come	back.	Those	who	come	back	will	 celebrate,	but	 for	 those
who	 will	 not	 come	 back	 from	 this	 great	 inner	 journey,	 some	 laughs	 as	 a
goodbye....
Kowalski	and	Olga	are	making	love	in	the	upstairs	bedroom.	Just	as	Kowalski	is
about	to	start	up	his	machinery,	they	hear	a	loud	banging	noise	downstairs.
"What's	that?"	asks	Olga,	jumping	up	in	bed.
"Nothing,"	pants	Kowalski.	"Come	on,	let's	get	on	with	it!"
"No!	No	way!"	demands	Olga.	"No	lovemaking	until	you	find	out	what	is	going
on	downstairs."
Poor	Kowalski	stumbles	downstairs	with	a	very	large	erection,	and	flips	on	the
the	lights.
Suddenly,	the	cat	jumps	out	of	the	window.	The	dog	dives	under	the	sofa.	And
the	parrot,	trapped	in	its	cage,	looks	around	frantically,	then	tucks	one	leg	under
its	wing	and	screams,	"Wait!	Wait,	you	silly	Polack...	you	wouldn't	fuck	a	cripple
would	you?"
Terrence	and	Mrs.	Tuber,	the	TV	Couch	Potatoes,	are	propped	up	on	their	potato
couch,	 chewing	 peanuts	 and	 watching	 their	 favorite	 soap	 opera	 "The	 Potato
Family"	on	television.
When	the	doorbell	rings,	Chip	the	dog	starts	barking,	and	Terrence	looks	around
at	it	and	accidentally	pops	a	peanut	into	his	ear.	He	is	still	sitting	on	his	potato
couch	with	his	head	 tipped	 to	one	 side,	 trying	 to	get	 the	peanut	out,	when	his
daughter	and	her	boyfriend	Frito	walk	in.
Frito	immediately	sees	the	situation	and	offers	to	help	Terrence	to	get	the	peanut
out.
"Look,"	says	Frito,	"I'll	cover	your	mouth,	stick	my	two	fingers	into	your	nostrils
and	then	blow	into	your	other	ear."
In	desperation,	Terrence	agrees	to	give	this	a	try.	Frito	stuffs	his	fingers	tightly
into	the	couch	potato's	nose	and	blows	into	his	ear.	Sure	enough,	the	peanut	pops
out	the	other	side.
Later	 that	evening,	Terrence	and	Mrs.	Tuber	are	propped	up	 in	bed	watching	a
re-run	of
"The	 Potato	 Family"	 on	 television,	when	Mrs.	 Tuber	 asks	 her	 husband,	 "That
Frito	is	such	a	nice	boy,	what	do	you	think	he	will	do	when	he	leaves	school?"
"I	don't	know	what	his	plans	are,"	 replies	Terrence.	"But	 from	the	smell	of	his
fingers,	I	think	he	will	probably	be	our	son-in-law."
"Hey	man,"	says	Swami	Haridas	to	his	friend,	Stonehead	Niskriya,	"how	come
you	got	home	so	early	from	your	date	with	Papaya	Pineapple	last	night?"
"Well,"	explains	Stonehead,	"after	dinner	we	went	back	to	her	apartment.	We	sat
on	her	bed	listening	to	music,	talked	for	a	while,	and	drank	some	herb	tea.	Then
she	slowly	undressed,	pulled	back	 the	bed	covers,	 lay	down,	 reached	over	me,
and	turned	out	the	light."
"So?"	asks	Haridas.	"What	happened?"
"Well,	I	can	take	a	hint,"	replies	Stonehead.	"So	I	went	home!"
Nivedano...
(Gibberish)
Nivedano...
Be	 silent.	 Close	 your	 eyes.	 Feel	 your	 body	 to	 be	 frozen;	 gather	 all	 your	 life
energy	inwards	and	look	in.
Deeper	and	deeper.
Find	the	center	of	your	being.
Finding	the	center	of	your	being	is	the	door	that	leads	you	beyond	yourself,	that
makes	you	a	buddha.
Be	well	acquainted	with	this	new	space	you	are	in,	because	you	have	to	carry	the
buddha	twenty-four	hours	--	in	your	gestures,	in	your	actions,	in	your	words,	in
your	silence,	waking	or	sleeping.
If	 one	 can	 remain	 with	 this	 silence,	 then	 there	 is	 no	 need	 to	 follow	 any
discipline,	any	virtue.	Everything	will	happen	on	its	own	accord,	spontaneously.
And	when	things	happen	spontaneously	they	have	a	beauty	of	their	own.
It	is	a	blissful	moment.
You	are	dissolved
into	an	oceanic	consciousness,
you	are	at	home,
realizing	that	which	you	have	carried	since	the	very	beginning,	for	thousands	of
lives,	but	have	never	looked	into	it...
never	searched	for	it,	have	taken	it	for	granted.
It	is	the	most	precious	treasure	in	you.
It	is	the	whole	universe	falling	in	you.
Nivedano,	to	make	it	clear...
Relax,	and	just	watch	the	body,	the	mind.
You	remain	a	watcher.
Just	a	watcher.
Your	body	is	born	and	dies.
Your	mind	every	moment	changes.
Only	this	watcher	is	your	eternity.
Remember	it.
Remind	yourself	of	it.
And	 slowly	 slowly	 make	 it	 your	 ordinary,	 simple	 life	 experience,	 just	 like
breathing.	You	don't	have	to	make	any	effort.
When	your	buddha	is	that	spontaneous,
you	have	found	the	truth.
Nivedano...
Come	back,	and	bring	with	you	all	the	fragrance	that	you	have	gathered.
Sit	down,	slowly,	gracefully	as	a	buddha,	for	a	few	seconds.
This	is	going	to	be	your	lifestyle.
I	don't	want	any	followers.
I	want	everybody	to	be	a	buddha,
a	master	unto	himself.
Okay,	Maneesha?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.
Can	we	celebrate	the	buddhas?
Yes!

OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
DAIKAKU	SAID:
ZEN	 PRACTICE	 IS	 NOT	 CLARIFYING	 CONCEPTUAL	 DISTINCTIONS,
BUT
THROWING	AWAY	ONE'S	PRECONCEIVED	VIEWS	AND	NOTIONS	AND
THE
SACRED	TEXTS	AND	ALL	THE	REST,	AND	PIERCING	THROUGH	THE
LAYERS
OF	COVERINGS	OVER	THE	SPRING	OF	SELF	BEHIND	THEM.
ALL	THE	HOLY	ONES	HAVE	TURNED	WITHIN	AND	SOUGHT	 IN	THE
SELF,	AND	BY	THIS,	WENT	BEYOND	ALL	DOUBT.
TO	TURN	WITHIN	MEANS	ALL	THE	TWENTY-FOUR	HOURS,	AND	 IN
EVERY
SITUATION,	 TO	 PIERCE,	 ONE	 BY	 ONE,	 THROUGH	 THE	 LAYERS
COVERING
THE	SELF,	DEEPER	AND	DEEPER,	TO	A	PLACE	WHICH	CANNOT	BE
DESCRIBED.	 IT	 IS	 WHEN	 THINKING	 COMES	 TO	 AN	 END	 AND
MAKING
DISTINCTIONS	 CEASES,	 WHEN	 WRONG	 VIEWS	 AND	 IDEAS
DISAPPEAR	OF
THEMSELVES	 WITHOUT	 HAVING	 TO	 BE	 DRIVEN	 FORTH;	 WHEN,
WITHOUT
BEING	SOUGHT,	THE	TRUE	ACTION	AND	TRUE	IMPULSE	APPEAR	OF
THEMSELVES.	IT	IS	WHEN	ONE	CAN	KNOW	WHAT	IS	THE	TRUTH	OF
THE
HEART.
THE	 MAN	 RESOLUTE	 IN	 THE	 WAY	 MUST,	 FROM	 THE	 BEGINNING,
NEVER
LOSE	SIGHT	OF	IT,	WHETHER	IN	A	PLACE	OF	CALM	OR	IN	A	PLACE
OF
STRIFE,	AND	HE	MUST	NOT	BE	CLINGING	TO	QUIET	PLACES	AND
SHUNNING	THOSE	WHERE	THERE	IS	DISTURBANCE.
IF	 HE	 TRIES	 TO	 TAKE	 REFUGE	 FROM	 TROUBLE	 BY	 RUNNING	 TO
SOME
QUIET	PLACE,	HE	WILL	FALL	INTO	DARK	REGIONS.
IF,	WHEN	HE	IS	TRYING	TO	THROW	OFF	DELUSIONS	AND	DISCOVER
TRUTH,	EVERYTHING	 IS	A	WHIRL	OF	POSSIBILITIES,	HE	MUST	CUT
OFF	THE
THOUSAND	IMPULSES	AND	GO	STRAIGHT	FORWARD,	HAVING	NO
THOUGHT	 AT	 ALL	 ABOUT	 GOOD	 OR	 BAD.	 NOT	 HATING	 THE
PASSIONS,	HE
MUST	SIMPLY	MAKE	HIS	HEART	PURE.
Maneesha,	Zen	can	say	things	which	no	other	religion	is	capable	of.	Zen	is	a	rare
flower.
All	 other	 religions	 are	 subservient	 to	 the	 vested	 interests,	 to	 the	 past,	 to	 the
society,	to	the	state.	Zen	is	an	exception.	My	love	for	it	is	not	without	reason.	It
is	the	only	revolutionary	approach	to	the	ultimate	reality,	and	a	man	like	Daikaku
is	a	perfectly	representative	master.	You	have	to	listen	to	his	every	word	as	if	you
are	listening	to	me.
DAIKAKU	SAID:
ZEN	PRACTICE	IS	NOT	CLARIFYING	CONCEPTUAL	DISTINCTIONS...
The	whole	 theological	world	and	 the	whole	philosophical	world	are	concerned
only	 with	 clarifying	 conceptual	 distinctions	 --	 what	 is	 what.	 They	 never	 go
beyond	the	conceptual	mind.	Looking	from	the	point	of	view	of	Zen,	what	they
are	doing	is	not	only	childish,	it	is	also	stupid.	A	child	can	grow	up,	but	stupidity
only	becomes	thicker	and	thicker	and	thicker.
All	 the	 religions	 have	 served	 the	 politicians,	 the	 emperors,	 the	murderers,	 the
criminals.
You	may	not	be	aware	of	it,	but	you	have	to	be	aware.	The	pope	in	the	second
world	war	blessed	Mussolini,	who	was	a	fascist,	to	be	victorious.	He	prayed	to
God	 to	make	Benito	Mussolini	 the	victor.	Now	 it	 is	 strange,	 the	archbishop	of
England	was	also	praying	to	the	same	God	--	both	are	Christians	--	but	Italy	and
England	were	at	war.	Even	Adolf	Hitler	was	blessed	and	received	the	prayers	of
both	the	Catholic	and	Protestant	religions.	Their	high	priests	prayed	to	God	that
he	should	be	made	the	victor.
Now,	God	must	 have	 been	 in	 trouble	 to	 decide!	All	 sides	were	 praying	 to	 the
same	 God,	 the	 same	 Christian	 God.	 They	 all	 worshipped	 the	 same	 Christian
Bible.	But	 this	strange	situation	shows	completely	that	your	religion	is	nothing
but	a	servant	to	the	state	--	it	can	even	pray	for	Adolf	Hitler	to	become	the	victor
over	the	world.	It	does	not	matter	for	whom	the	religion	is	praying;	it	has	always
been	favorable	to	those	who	have	power	and	riches.
Zen	 is	 in	 every	way	 exceptional.	 Japan	was	 also	 at	 war	 but	 not	 a	 single	 Zen
master	blessed	the	emperor	of	Japan	to	be	the	conqueror.
The	 emperor	 of	 Japan	 had	 gone	 to	 receive	 blessings	 from	 a	 Zen	 master,	 and
wondered	how	to	ask	him.	First	he	had	tried	to	persuade	the	master	to	come	to
his	court.	The	master	refused.	He	said,	"Even	if	God	calls	me	to	his	court,	I	will
refuse.	I	am	perfectly	happy	where	I	am.	If	you	want	to	see	me,	then	you	have	to
come.	The	thirsty	has	to	come	to	the	well."	A	clear-cut	answer....
The	emperor	finally	had	to	concede,	reluctantly,	and	he	went	with	all	his	court
following	him.	Not	finding	a	word	--	what	 to	say?	--	he	asked,	"I	have	always
wondered:	what	is	hell	and	what	is	heaven?"
The	master	said,	"You	idiot!"	I	don't	think	any	emperor	has	ever	received	such	a
welcome.	A	poor	monk	who	has	 no	 possessions,	 nothing	 except	 himself...	 but
having	himself	gives	him	such	authority	that	he	can	say	to	the	emperor,	"You	are
an	 idiot!"	The	emperor	became	 furious.	This	was	 too	much.	He	pulled	out	his
sword	and	was	going	to	cut	off	the	head	of	the	master.
The	master	said,	"Wait	a	little...	this	is	the	door	of	hell."
The	 emperor	 thought	 for	 a	 moment.	 He	 had	 been	 given	 the	 answer:	 anger,
violence,	destructiveness.	He	pulled	back	his	sword	and	the	master	said,	"This	is
the	door	of	heaven.	Do	you	want	to	ask	any	more	questions?"
The	emperor	said,	"I	am	satisfied."	He	could	not	manage	to	ask,	"Bless	me,	that	I
should	be	the	victor	in	the	great	world	war."	Just	being	in	the	master's	presence,
the	very	idea	looked	stupid.
Zen	has	never	been	in	any	way	what	Karl	Marx	calls	the	opium	of	the	people.	It
is	unfortunate	that	a	genius	like	Karl	Marx	had	no	idea	of	Zen.	He	knew,	in	the
name	of	religion,	only	Christianity	which	is	the	worst	religion	in	the	world.	He
did	 not	 know	 the	 flights	 of	 Gautam	 Buddha,	 of	Mahakashyap,	 of	 Nansen,	 of
Tozan.	 He	 was	 absolutely	 unaware	 of	 the	 East,	 and	 religion	 is	 an	 Eastern
contribution	to	the	world.	In	the	Far	East,	in	Japan,	it	has	come	to	flower	in	its
totality.
Daikaku	 is	 one	 of	 those	 masters	 who	 have	 come	 to	 their	 fullness,	 to	 their
fulfillment.	Just	listen	to	what	he	says:
ZEN	 PRACTICE	 IS	 NOT	 CLARIFYING	 CONCEPTUAL	 DISTINCTIONS,
BUT
THROWING	AWAY	ONE'S	PRECONCEIVED	VIEWS	AND	NOTIONS	AND
THE
SACRED	TEXTS	AND	ALL	THE	REST,	AND	PIERCING	THROUGH	THE
LAYERS
OF	COVERINGS	OVER	THE	SPRING	OF	SELF	BEHIND	THEM.
Daikaku	is	famous	for	burning	all	the	scriptures	that	belonged	to	the	monastery
of	which	he	had	become	the	head,	the	successor.	He	burned	all	the	scriptures	and
he	stopped	one	thousand	disciples	in	the	monastery	from	reading	them,	saying,
"This	 is	not	a	university,	you	are	not	here	 to	study	something.	You	are	here	 to
transform	yourself,	to	seek	yourself;	and	that	is	not	possible	through	scriptures.
Throw	out	all	these	scriptures,	holy	and	unholy,	both	together."
It	was	very	shocking	when	Daikaku	did	it.	It	shocked	almost	the	whole	Buddhist
world.
But	 Daikaku	 was	 a	 man	 of	 the	 same	 strength	 and	 the	 same	 power	 as
Bodhidharma	or	Mahakashyap.	He	did	 not	 care	what	 the	world	 said,	 he	 knew
what	he	was	doing.	The	only	way	 to	 reach	yourself	 is	 to	 throw	away	 all	 your
preconceived	 ideas,	 all	 your	 prejudices,	 all	 your	 scriptures,	 all	 your	 religious
notions.	Anything	concerned	with	 the	self	 that	has	been	conceived	 through	 the
mind	has	to	be	thrown	away,	cleaned	out	completely.
No	 scriptures	 can	 give	 you	 the	 experience	 of	 your	 being.	 They	 are	 really	 the
hindrances	--
your	life	spring	is	covered	by	those	layers	of	prejudices	and	conceptions.	Unless
you	 throw	 them	away,	whether	 it	 is	 the	Bible	or	Shrimad	Bhagavadgita	or	 the
holy	Koran	or	Dhammapada...	it	does	not	matter	what	it	is.	Whatever	is	covering
your	life	spring,	 throw	it	away	without	a	single	moment	of	hesitation.	Because
all	 that	 is	borrowed	is	 just	dust,	 layers	and	layers	of	dust,	and	you	are	covered
with	that	dust.
ALL	THE	HOLY	ONES	HAVE	TURNED	WITHIN	AND	SOUGHT	 IN	THE
SELF,	AND	BY	THIS,	WENT	BEYOND	ALL	DOUBT.
He	is	saying,	"It	 is	not	only	me,	but	all	 the	buddhas	have	done	the	same.	They
have	all	burned	the	whole	contents	of	the	mind	and	cleared	the	space	so	that	the
life	 springs	 can	 flow	 directly	 and	 you	 can	 know	 for	 the	 first	 time	 your	 own
eternity,	your	own	splendor."
It	is	a	paradox	to	say	it,	but	it	is	a	fact	that	all	your	religious	teaching	is	a	barrier
to	 your	 becoming	 religious.	 To	 know	 anything	 about	 God	 from	 others	 is
dangerous.	 It	 will	 prevent	 you	 from	 knowing	 existence	 directly,	 and	 you	 will
settle	for	cheap	knowledge.
Zen's	whole	 revolution	 is:	 don't	 settle	 for	 cheap	 knowledge;	 go	 for	 the	 costly
experience.
And	anything	that	hinders	the	way,	throw	it	out.	Gautam	Buddha	has	even	said,
"If	I	come	into	your	meditations,	cut	off	my	head	immediately!	Nobody	is	to	be
allowed	to	hinder	your	progress."	These	were	real	lions.	Humanity	can	be	proud
of	 these	people	who	did	not	desire	 to	enslave	you,	as	Catholics,	 as	Hindus,	as
Mohammedans;	whose	whole	effort	was	to	liberate	you	from	all	"isms,"	from	all
churches,	and	to	help	you	penetrate	your	own	reality.	That	is	the	only	truth,	the
only	space	which	is	holy.
TO	TURN	WITHIN	MEANS	ALL	THE	TWENTY-FOUR	HOURS,	AND	 IN
EVERY
SITUATION,	 TO	 PIERCE,	 ONE	 BY	 ONE,	 THROUGH	 THE	 LAYERS
COVERING
THE	SELF,	DEEPER	AND	DEEPER,	TO	A	PLACE	WHICH	CANNOT	BE
DESCRIBED.	 IT	 IS	 WHEN	 THINKING	 COMES	 TO	 AN	 END	 AND
MAKING
DISTINCTIONS	 CEASES,	 WHEN	 WRONG	 VIEWS	 AND	 IDEAS
DISAPPEAR	OF
THEMSELVES	 WITHOUT	 HAVING	 TO	 BE	 DRIVEN	 FORTH;	 WHEN,
WITHOUT
BEING	SOUGHT,	THE	TRUE	ACTION	AND	TRUE	IMPULSE	APPEAR	OF
THEMSELVES.	IT	IS	WHEN	ONE	CAN	KNOW	WHAT	IS	THE	TRUTH	OF
THE
HEART.
In	 these	 few	 statements	 he	 has	 covered	 the	 whole	 journey	 from	 falsehood	 to
truth,	from	darkness	to	light,	from	death	to	immortality.	What	he	has	said	can	be
condensed,	so	 that	you	can	remember	 it	not	as	knowledge	but	only	as	a	 finger
indicating	the	moon	--	just	a	few	hints	for	your	own	inner	journey.
The	first	 thing	 is,	 twenty-four	hours	a	day,	 to	remember	what	you	find	 in	your
meditations.	You	will	 forget	again	and	again,	but	 the	gaps	of	forgetfulness	will
become	less	and	the	length	of	remembering	will	become	longer.	By	and	by	the
gaps	 of	 forgetting	 will	 disappear.	 There	 comes	 a	 time	 when	 you	 are	 a	 whole
circle	of	remembrance,	twenty-four	hours.	Even	in	your	sleep	you	know	you	are
a	buddha.
A	small	story	will	explain	it	to	you....
Ananda,	 Buddha's	 very	 intimate	 disciple,	 was	 almost	 forty-two	 years
continuously	 serving	 Buddha,	 day	 and	 night,	 summer	 and	 winter.	 One	 night
when	Buddha	was	 going	 to	 lie	 down,	Ananda	 said,	 "I	 don't	 generally	 ask	 any
questions,	because	every	question	that	I	could	ask,	others	ask.	And	I	am	always
here,	 so	 I	 listen	 to	 the	 answer.	 I	 know	 that	 any	question	 I	 have	 is	 going	 to	be
asked	by	somebody	or	other;	in	these	years	this	has	become	my	experience.	But
there	is	one	question	I	don't	think	anybody	is	going	to	ask.	It	is	very	situational."
Buddha	said,	"You	can	ask."
"The	 question,"	 he	 said,	 "is	 not	 very	 great.	 But	 it	 has	 been	 troubling	 me	 for
years."
Buddha	said,	"You	could	have	asked	at	any	time."
Ananda	said,	"I	never	wanted	to	trouble	you.	The	whole	day	you	are	working	on
people,	and	in	the	night	you	are	alone	with	me.	The	question	is	that	I	have	been
watching	you	for	twenty	years	continuously...	even	in	the	night	I	get	up	once	or
twice	 to	 have	 a	 look	 at	 you	 to	 see	 whether	 you	 are	 all	 right.	What	 has	 been
puzzling	me	is	that	you	keep	the	same	posture	the	whole	night.	You	don't	change
sides,	you	don't	even	move	your	leg.	Do	you	sleep	or	do	you	remain	awake?"
Buddha	 said,	 "My	 body	 sleeps;	 it	 sleeps	 very	 profoundly.	 But	 as	 far	 as	 I	 am
concerned,	 I	am	 just	a	pure	awareness.	So	having	 found	 the	 right	position,	 the
one	which	is	the	most	comfortable,	I	have	not	changed	it	for	twenty	years.	And	I
am	not	going	to	change	it	till	my	last	breath."
He	died	in	the	same	posture.	Because	of	Buddha,	the	posture	has	become	known
as	 the	Lion's	Posture.	For	 forty-two	years	 after	 his	 enlightenment,	 his	 day	 and
night	was	a	continuity	of	awareness.
That's	what	Daikaku	is	saying:
TO	TURN	WITHIN	MEANS	ALL	THE	TWENTY-FOUR	HOURS...
Go	on	 turning	 in.	Whenever	you	 find	a	moment	 to	 turn,	 turn.	And	 it	 is	 such	a
simple	 act	 to	 turn	within	 --	 nobody's	 help	 is	 needed.	No	 ladder	 is	 needed,	 no
door	has	to	be	opened.
Just	close	your	eyes	and	look	in.	Sitting	in	a	bus,	traveling	in	a	train...	you	can	do
it	 any	 time,	 and	 slowly	 slowly	 you	 don't	 even	 need	 to	 close	 your	 eyes.	 The
remembrance	simply	remains,	of	its	own	accord.
That's	what	Daikaku	is	saying:
IT	IS	MOST	BEAUTIFUL	WHEN,	WITHOUT	BEING	SOUGHT,	THE	TRUE
ACTION	AND	TRUE	IMPULSE	APPEAR	OF	THEMSELVES.	IT	IS	WHEN
ONE
CAN	KNOW	WHAT	IS	THE	TRUTH	OF	THE	HEART.
What	is	 the	truth	of	 the	heart?	The	ordinary	commonsense	view	of	the	heart	 is
that	it	is	the	source	of	emotions	like	love	or	hate	or	anger.	Just	as	the	mind	is	the
source	of	conceptual	thoughts,	the	heart	is	the	source	of	all	that	is	emotional	and
sentimental.	That	is	the	commonsense	view.
But	when	Buddha	says	`the	heart'	he	means	the	very	center	of	your	being.	It	is
his	understanding	that	your	love,	your	hate,	everything,	arises	out	of	your	mind.
And	 I	 think	 he	 is	 being	 absolutely	 scientific;	 all	 psychologists	will	 agree	with
him.
You	can	experiment	yourself.	You	can	see	from	where	your	anger	arises	--	it	is
the	 mind;	 from	 where	 your	 emotions	 arise	 --	 it	 is	 the	 mind.	 Mind	 is	 a	 big
phenomenon;	 it	 covers	 conceptual	 thinking,	 it	 covers	 your	 emotional	 patterns,
your	 sentiments.	 To	Buddha,	 the	mind	 contains	 all	 that	 arises	 in	 you,	 and	 the
heart	is	that	which	is	always	silent	and	empty	and	watching.
What	is	THE	TRUTH	OF	THE	HEART?	--	Silence	and	watchfulness.
THE	 MAN	 RESOLUTE	 IN	 THE	 WAY	 MUST,	 FROM	 THE	 BEGINNING,
NEVER
LOSE	SIGHT	OF	IT...
From	the	very	beginning	one	should	remember	that	we	are	in	search	of	a	place,	a
space,	where	nothing	arises	--	no	dust,	no	smoke;	where	everything	is	pure	and
clean,	 utterly	 empty,	 just	 spaciousness.	 One	 should	 be	 clear	 from	 the	 very
beginning	what	we	are	looking	for.
...	NEVER	LOSE	SIGHT	OF	IT,	WHETHER	IN	A	PLACE	OF	CALM	OR	IN	A
PLACE	 OF	 STRIFE,	 AND	 HE	 MUST	 NOT	 BE	 CLINGING	 TO	 QUIET
PLACES	AND
SHUNNING	THOSE	WHERE	THERE	IS	DISTURBANCE.
Zen	is	not	against	the	world.	That	is	one	more	of	its	rebellious	attitudes	against
all	 religions.	 All	 religions	 somehow	 condemn	 the	 world.	 All	 religions	 praise
those	 who	 have	 renounced	 the	 world,	 those	 who	 have	 gone	 away	 from	 it,
renouncing	the	wife,	the	children,	the	home.
Somebody	has	some	day	to	do	deep	research	into	how	many	millions	of	people
have	left	the	world	in	the	name	of	religion	and	caused	to	suffer	small	children,
old	 parents,	 wives	 and	 husbands;	 who	 have	 disturbed	 the	 life	 of	many	 in	 the
name	 of	 religion.	 And	 do	 you	 think	 these	 people	 have	 found	 anything?	 They
have	simply	created	many	prostitutes,	many	orphanages,	many	poor	old	people,
dying	without	food	or	medicine.	And	what	have	they	gained?	Not	a	single	one	of
them	has	attained	to	buddhahood.
Zen	 is	 very	 clear	 and	 straightforward	 about	 everything.	 It	 is	 not	 a	 question	 of
renouncing	the	world;	the	question	is	of	renouncing	your	mind.
Wherever	 you	 go,	 your	mind	will	 go	with	 you.	Your	 knowledge	will	 go	with
you,	 your	 prejudices	will	 go	with	 you,	 your	 scriptures	will	 go	with	 you.	Your
idea	that	you	are	a	Hindu	or	a	Mohammedan	will	go	with	you.	So	what	are	you
renouncing?
Zen	does	not	want	you	to	renounce	the	world	but	to	renounce	the	mind,	so	that
you	can	find	the	empty	heart.	The	empty	heart	is	your	purity,	your	virginity.	This
empty	heart	opens	the	door	to	the	universal	and	the	eternal.
Daikaku	is	saying	that	people	ordinarily	do	one	thing:	wherever	there	is	strife	or
some	 disturbance,	 they	 avoid	 that	 place.	 These	 are	 the	 people	 who	 have
renounced	the	world	because	to	be	in	the	world	is	a	difficult	task,	every	moment
there	is	some	difficulty.	They	are	escapists.
Once	and	for	all	 it	should	be	clear	that	 the	future	of	religion	cannot	depend	on
the	escapists.	The	authentic	 religious	man	will	 live	 in	 the	world	without	being
disturbed	by	all	kinds	of	disturbances.	He	will	be	simply	a	watcher,	unperturbed.
In	fact	the	world	is	a	good	place	because	it	gives	you	an	opportunity	to	test	your
silence,	your	meditativeness,	your	watchfulness.	Be	in	the	world	but	don't	be	of
it.	Be	in	the	world	but	don't	let	the	world	be	in	you.
It	is	the	ordinary	mind's	approach	that	where	things	are	quiet	and	peaceful,	it	is
good;	there	you	can	meditate.	So	people	have	gone	to	the	Himalayas	to	meditate.
And	what	 they	meditate	 on,	 you	will	 be	 surprised:	 they	meditate	more	 on	 the
world	that	they	have	left	behind!	Because	everything	that	they	have	left	behind
forcibly,	follows	them	in	their	minds.
I	have	heard	two	stories.	One	is	about	an	American	billionaire.	He	became	tired
of	money,	tired	of	women,	tired	of	drugs.	Finally	he	thought,	"I	have	to	go	to	the
Himalayas,	 to	find	a	real	master	 to	show	me	the	way	to	peace."	He	traveled	to
the	 Himalayas	 and	 inquired,	 "Is	 somebody	 aware	 of	 an	 authentic	 master?"
People	 said,	 "Yes,	 there	 is	 a	man	 near	Mansarovar"	 --	 the	 highest	 lake	 in	 the
world,	on	 top	of	 the	Himalayas.	 "He	has	been	 there	perhaps	 for	 sixty	years	or
more,	nobody	remembers;	we	have	always	known	him	to	be	there.	He	is	the	only
man	there."
Even	 the	 swans	which	 live	 in	Mansarovar	 leave	 it	 for	 three	months	 and	 come
down	to	the	plains,	because	for	those	months	the	lake	is	completely	frozen.	You
can	walk	on	it,	you	can	drive	over	it;	it	is	like	solid	rock.	The	people	said,	"But
even	in	those	months	that	man	never	leaves	the	place.	Obviously,	he	must	have
found	the	truth;	otherwise	why	should	one	remain	there	for	sixty	years	 in	such
arduous	conditions?"
The	billionaire	was	not	to	be	discouraged;	on	the	contrary,	it	became	a	challenge.
He	was	a	man	who	had	fought	many	challenges	in	his	life.	He	was	born	a	poor
man	and	he	became	a	billionaire	by	sheer	effort	and	struggle.	So	he	struggled;	it
was	a	difficult	task	to	reach	there,	because	no	buses	go	there,	no	roads	go	there.
He	had	to	find	his	path	by	just	looking	at	the	map	and	moving	into	the	unknown.
Finally,	 he	 found	 an	 old	man,	 a	 very	 old	man.	He	 thought	 in	 his	mind	 that	 if
there	is	any	God,	he	must	look	like	this	man!	He	was	very	happy,	although	tired
and	tattered.	He	fell	at	the	feet	of	the	old	man	and	he	said,	"I	am	coming	from
America.	I	am	a	super-rich	man,	but	I	am	tired	of	the	world;	I	have	renounced
everything."
The	old	man	looked	at	him	and	said,	"These	matters	we	will	discuss	later	on.	Do
you	have	a	cigarette	on	you?	Sixty	years,	and	not	a	single	 idiot	has	come	here
with	a	cigarette."
The	 billionaire	was	 very	much	 shocked,	 but	 he	 gave	 his	whole	 packet,	 and	 a
lighter,	and	the	old	man	said,	"You	are	a	very	religious	person."
"But,"	the	billionaire	said,	"what	am	I	to	do	now?"
He	 said,	 "Go	 back.	 And	 when	 you	 come	 again,	 bring	 as	 many	 cigarettes	 as
possible."
He	said,	"This	is	strange!	I	had	come	here	for	enlightenment..."
The	old	man	 said,	 "Do	what	 I	 have	 told	 you.	 Just	 this	way	 --	 going	back	 and
coming	again,	going	back	and	coming	again	--	you	will	become	enlightened."
Miserably,	he	went	away.	No	one	has	ever	heard	that	he	came	back	again.	But
this	man,	for	sixty	years,	had	been	waiting	for	a	cigarette.
The	second	story	is	certainly	fiction.	This	one	that	I	have	just	told	you	may	be
true.	The	second	is	that	when	Edmund	Hillary	reached	Everest	he	was	surprised
to	see	a	Hindu	sannyasin	squatting	on	the	ground	there.	He	said,	"My	god!	We
used	to	think	that	nobody	had	ever	reached	here.	How	did	you	manage?"
He	said,	"I	come	here	every	day.	This	is	a	sort	of	toilet	for	me.	I	live	just	nearby.
But	these	things	we	can	discuss	later	on	--	how	much	for	your	watch?	Because
here	it	is	so	difficult	to	know	what	time	it	is..."
These	people	who	have	escaped	from	the	world,	do	you	think	they	are	thinking
about	anything	else?	They	are	thinking	more	of	the	world	than	you	are,	because
you	don't	have	to	think	--	it	is	there!	These	poor	fellows	have	to	think	thousands
of	things	which	are	not	there.	Mind	always	desires	that	which	is	not	there.	That
which	is	with	you,	mind	simply	accepts;	there	is	no	need	to	think	about	it.
This	ordinary	conception	has	prevailed	amongst	humanity	that	one	should	go	to
a	 quiet	 place	 to	 meditate,	 and	 get	 away	 from	 places	 which	 are	 full	 of	 strife,
struggle,	 conflict.	 But	 Zen	 has	 a	 totally	 different	 attitude	 --	 and	 more
psychological.	There	is	no	need	to	leave	the	world.	The	world	is	a	perfectly	good
place	--	as	a	fire	test.	What	is	needed	is	to	go	in,	not	to	go	somewhere	out.
And	you	can	go	in	anywhere	in	the	world,	whether	it	is	the	Himalayas	or	the	M.
G.	Road.
You	can	become	enlightened	even	with	a	rented	bicycle!	It	does	not	matter	that	it
was	 rented.	 I	 have	 heard	 of	 people	 becoming	 enlightened	 even	 on	 stolen
bicycles,	because	becoming	enlightened	has	nothing	to	do	with	bicycles.
Daikaku	says:
IF	 HE	 TRIES	 TO	 TAKE	 REFUGE	 FROM	 TROUBLE	 BY	 RUNNING	 TO
SOME
QUIET	PLACE,	HE	WILL	FALL	INTO	DARK	REGIONS.
No	other	 religion	has	 said	 that.	And	 I	authenticate	 it:	The	person	who	escapes
from	troubles	falls	certainly	into	a	very	dark	space,	because	his	very	beginning	is
wrong.	 He	 is	 going	 away	 from	 the	 trouble.	 He	 should	 have	 remained	 in	 the
trouble,	untroubled	--	that	would	have	been	some	gain.	But	he	has	escaped	from
it,	and	when	there	is	no	struggle,	no	trouble,	no	strife....	Sitting	somewhere	in	the
Himalayas,	the	silence	that	surrounds	you	is	of	the	Himalayas,	not	of	you.	That
is	not	going	to	help.	You	have	to	find	your	own	Himalayas	within.
IF,	WHEN	HE	IS	TRYING	TO	THROW	OFF	DELUSIONS	AND	DISCOVER
TRUTH,	EVERYTHING	 IS	A	WHIRL	OF	POSSIBILITIES,	HE	MUST	CUT
OFF	THE
THOUSAND	IMPULSES	AND	GO	STRAIGHT	FORWARD,	HAVING	NO
THOUGHT	AT	ALL	ABOUT	GOOD	OR	BAD.
You	 can	 see	 the	 rebelliousness	 of	 Zen.	 Every	 religion	 is	 concerned	 that	 you
should	be	good,	you	should	not	be	bad,	you	should	be	respectable,	you	should
not	be	condemned	by	the	society.	You	should	not	lose	your	good	repute	even	if
you	have	to	be	a	hypocrite.	Just	be	good,	even	though	the	good	is	not	arising	on
its	own	but	you	are	forcing	it.
It	 is	 the	 greatness	 of	 Zen....	 Don't	 have	 any	 thoughts	 about	 good	 or	 bad.	 Be
absolutely	a	witness,	and	while	you	are	just	a	witness,	whatever	happens	through
you	is	bound	to	be	good.	The	whole	world	may	condemn	it;	it	does	not	matter.
You	have	to	listen	only	to	your	own	heart.	If	your	heart	says	"yes,	go	on,"	then
go	 on	 straight	 forward.	 Even	 if	 it	 is	 against	 all	morality,	 against	 all	 doctrines,
against	 all	 religions,	 it	 does	 not	 matter.	 It	 should	 not	 be	 against	 your	 simple,
innocent	heart.	The	only	criterion	is	that	it	should	be	spontaneous.	Spontaneity	is
good;	non-spontaneity	is	hypocrisy.
NOT	 HATING	 THE	 PASSIONS,	 HE	 MUST	 SIMPLY	 MAKE	 HIS	 HEART
PURE.
On	every	point	Zen	differs	 from	all	 other	 religions,	 and	on	every	point	Zen	 is
right.	 It	 does	 not	 say	 to	 you,	 "Fight	 with	 your	 passions,	 drop	 your	 passions.
Unless	 you	 drop	 all	 your	 desires,	 passions,	 longings,	 you	 cannot	 attain	 to	 the
truth."	 The	 reality	 is	 just	 vice	 versa.	 If	 you	 get	 into	 this	 struggle	 of	 dropping
passions,	you	will	never	win.	Don't	be	bothered	by	the	passions,	by	the	desires.
Find	the	empty	heart	and	its	purity	and	you	will	find	that	all	passions,	all	desires
are	transformed.
People	always	begin	from	the	wrong	end.	And	there	is	a	reason	why	they	begin
with	the	wrong	end.	The	wrong	end	seems	to	be	rational.	For	example,	they	see
in	Gautam	Buddha	great	compassion.	This	compassion	is	arising	spontaneously,
but	they	don't	know	the	empty	heart	of	the	buddha,	from	where	this	compassion
is	arising.	They	can	see	his	compassionate	actions,	and	they	logically	derive	the
conclusion	that	if	you	do	compassionate	acts	you	will	become	a	buddha.
The	law,	the	dhamma,	does	not	work	this	way.	In	the	first	place	you	cannot	drop
the	 passions.	You	 can	 fight,	 you	 can	wrestle,	 and	 you	 can	 suffer	 and	 you	 can
torture	yourself.
You	can	repress,	you	can	become	a	pervert	--	as	all	the	monks	of	all	the	religions
have	 become	 perverts,	 psychologically	 sick,	 because	 they	 have	 been	 fighting
against	nature.
Nobody	 can	 win	 against	 nature.	 But	 they	 are	 doing	 something	 "rational."	 It
seems	 to	 them	 that	 by	 being	 compassionate...	 And	 their	 compassion	 will	 be
bogus,	false.	You	know	when	your	smile	is	just	on	the	lips,	a	lipstick	smile,	it	has
no	roots	anywhere	inside.	It	is	just	there	on	the	lips.
I	have	heard	about	a	politician	in	America.	In	America,	politicians	in	an	election
go	from	house	to	house,	kissing	small	babies.	In	a	small	park	there	were	at	least
two	dozen	babies	with	one	woman.	The	politician	 thought,	 "My	god!"	And	all
those	 babies	were	 dirty,	 smelly,	 their	 noses	 running,	 and	 he	 had	 to	 kiss	 all	 of
them	just	 to	convince	the	woman	that	he	was	the	right	candidate.	Then	he	told
the	woman,	"Remember,	this	is	my	name	and	I	am	running	for	president."
She	said,	"I	will	remember.	You	are	so	kind."
Then	 he	 asked	 the	 woman,	 "Just	 one	 question	 arises	 --	 are	 all	 these	 children
yours?"
She	said,	"No,	not	a	single	one."
The	politician	said,	"Not	a	single	one?	What	are	you	doing	here?"
She	 said,	 "I	 am	 just	 keeping	 an	 eye	 on	 them.	 Their	 mothers	 have	 gone	 to	 a
conference."
He	said,	"Fuck	you,	you	noodle!	Why	didn't	you	tell	me	before?	I	had	to	kiss	all
these	brats	--	they	all	seem	to	be	Italians,	full	of	spaghetti	--	and	you	didn't	stop
me!"	All	that	kissing	was	just	political,	diplomatic.
Unless	your	life	arises	from	your	spontaneity,	from	your	very	empty	heart,	it	is
going	to	be	just	superficial.	And	with	the	superficial	you	cannot	be	blissful;	with
the	superficial	you	are	going	to	remain	miserable.	Only	with	the	truth	is	there	the
beginning	of	a	different	kind	of	life	--	of	joy,	of	bliss,	of	dance.	Then	your	whole
being	is	full	of	songs.
Then	all	your	actions	are	poetic.	Then	your	very	presence	has	a	grace,	a	beauty
which	is	not	of	the	body.	It	is	radiating	from	the	body	but	it	is	coming	from	the
deep	sources	of	your	own	empty	heart.
Upon	his	enlightenment	a	Zen	monk	wrote:
YOU,	BEFORE	ME	STANDING,
OH,	MY	ETERNAL	SELF!
SINCE	MY	FIRST	GLIMPSE
YOU	HAVE	BEEN	MY	SECRET	LOVE.
At	 the	 moment	 of	 death	 you	 cannot	 think	 about	 what	 movie	 is	 running	 in	 a
certain	theater.	When	death	is	standing	before	you,	you	cannot	think	of	anything
else.	The	Zen	monk	is	saying	in	this	small	haiku:
YOU,	BEFORE	ME	STANDING,	OH,	MY	ETERNAL	SELF!
In	the	mirror	of	death	he	has	seen	his	original	face.	All	 things	are	dropped,	all
concerns	are	dropped,	all	preoccupations	are	dropped.
SINCE	MY	FIRST	GLIMPSE	YOU	HAVE	BEEN	MY	SECRET	LOVE.
You	 are	 all	 in	 search	 of	 a	 secret	 love.	 And	 you	 are	 all	 trying	 to	 find	 it	 in
somebody	else.
Hence	the	frustration	of	all	lovers	except	those	who	are	never	allowed	to	meet.
Only	 those	who	 are	 never	 allowed	 to	meet	 are	 remembered,	 for	 centuries,	 for
their	great	love.
In	 the	 East	 we	 know	 Shiri	 and	 Farhad,	 Laila	 and	Majnu.	 Because	 they	 were
never	allowed	to	meet	by	their	parents	and	society	they	have	become	symbolic
of	great	lovers.
But	it	is	strange:	they	were	never	allowed	even	to	meet	with	each	other,	and	they
have	become	the	symbols	of	great	love.	And	what	has	happened	to	the	millions
of	lovers	who	have	been	allowed?	Not	a	single	one	of	them	has	proved	to	be	a
great	lover.	All	are	simply	lousy.
Every	love	affair	is	a	failure,	without	exception.	You	may	accept	it,	you	may	not.
One	 tries	 to	 hide	 the	 fact	 as	 long	 as	 possible,	 but	 everybody	 knows	 what
everybody	is	doing.
Your	frustration	is	bound	to	happen.	Your	real	love	is	for	the	eternal	self,	hidden
behind	the	curtain,	and	you	never	look	behind	the	curtain.	You	are	just	playing
on	the	stage	and	befooling.
Everybody's	great	love	is	to	know	the	secret	of	the	eternal	and	immortal	life.	You
cannot	find	it	in	another	person.	When	you	meet	on	the	sea	beach	it	seems	--	and
to	everyone	it	is	the	same	story	--	"this	woman	--	or	this	man	--	is	made	for	me."
Nobody	is	made	for	anybody;	everybody	is	made	for	himself.
You	are	not	some	kind	of	manufactured	parts,	such	that	you	are	made	to	fit	with
each	 other.	 So	 when	 you	 don't	 fit,	 then	 the	 tragedy	 begins.	 Before	 that	 all	 is
goody-goody.	 The	 real	 test	 is	 after	 the	 honeymoon.	 After	 the	 honeymoon	 the
lovers	are	finished,	they	don't	look	at	each	other	eye	to	eye.	The	husband	goes	on
reading	the	same	newspaper	to	avoid	the	wife....
A	man	was	saying	to	his	friend	in	the	pub,	"Why	do	you	always	remain	silent?
You	don't	say	anything."
He	said,	"The	whole	credit	goes	to	my	wife.	She	talks	and	I	listen.	She	does	not
like	 any	 interruption.	 So	 after	 years	 of	 listening	 without	 interrupting,	 it	 has
become	a	habit.
Wherever	I	am,	even	though	my	wife	is	not	there,	I	sit	silently."
The	 failure	 of	 love	 in	 the	world	 shows	 a	 significant	 fact:	 perhaps	 our	 love	 is
searching	 for	 something	 else,	 and	 because	 we	 don't	 find	 it	 in	 our	 so-called
lovers,	the	frustration	arises.
Nobody	 is	 responsible,	 it	 is	 just	 that	 our	 direction	 is	wrong.	 The	 real	 lover	 is
within	you.
The	 eternal	 lover	 is	 within	 you.	 Once	 you	 have	 found	 it,	 you	 are	 absolutely
content	with	yourself.	There	 is	 no	need	 for	 anyone	because	you	 are	no	 longer
incomplete.
Only	a	buddha	is	fulfilled.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
WHAT	IS	THE	WISDOM	OF	THE	HEART?
Maneesha,	 common	 sense	 carries	many	 fragments	 of	 truth,	 but	 they	 are	 never
complete.
Around	 the	world	everywhere	 it	 is	heard	 --	"the	wisdom	of	 the	heart."	But	 the
truth	is,	wisdom	arises	not	out	of	the	heart,	it	arises	out	of	the	emptiness	of	the
heart.	But	that	is	known	only	to	those	who	have	reached	deepest	into	the	self.
But	 common	 sense	 carries	 fragments	 of	 knowledge.	 It	 knows	 that	 the	 people
who	 are	 compassionate,	 people	 of	 heart,	 have	 a	 certain	 wisdom	which	 is	 not
knowledge,	 a	 certain	 insight,	 a	 certain	 intuitiveness	 which	 cannot	 be	 taught.
They	can	see	things,	feel	things.
They	are	sensitive	to	things	which	are	not	available	to	the	mind.	So	people	start
thinking	that	there	are	possibilities	of	the	heart	having	wisdom.
But	they	don't	know	that	the	heart	is	your	emptiness.	And	out	of	your	emptiness
a	 clarity,	 a	 transparency	 arises	 which	 can	 see	 things	 which	 you	 cannot
intellectually	infer.	This	is	wisdom.
To	make	 it	 complete,	Maneesha,	 it	 has	 to	 be	 said,	 "the	wisdom	 of	 the	 empty
heart."	The	heart,	as	the	physiologist	knows	it,	is	just	a	blood-pumping	system.
Out	 of	 your	 heartbeats	 no	wisdom	 can	 arise.	 Have	 you	 ever	 felt	 any	wisdom
arising	 from	 your	 heartbeats?	 Has	 any	 doctor	 ever	 heard	 some	wisdom	while
checking	your	heartbeats	through	his	stethoscope?
This	heart	 is	not	 the	one	we	mean	when	we	are	 talking	about	 the	emptiness	of
the	heart.
Actually,	we	are	talking	about	throwing	away	all	the	contents	of	the	mind.	Then,
the	no-mind	itself	becomes	your	heart.	It	is	not	a	physiological	thing.	It	is	your
no-mind	--	no	prejudice,	no	knowledge,	no	content.	Just	purity,	simple	silence,
and	 the	 no-mind	 can	 be	 called	 the	 empty	 heart.	 It	 is	 only	 a	 question	 of
expression.	What	you	want	to	choose,	you	can	choose:	the	wisdom	of	the	empty
heart,	or	the	wisdom	of	no-mind	--	they	are	equivalent.
When	you	are	in	deep	meditation,	you	feel	a	great	serenity,	a	joy	that	is	unknown
to	you,	a	watchfulness	that	is	a	new	guest.	Soon	this	watchfulness	will	become
the	 host.	 The	 day	 the	 watchfulness	 becomes	 the	 host,	 it	 remains	 twenty-four
hours	with	you.	And	out	of	this	watchfulness,	whatever	you	do	has	a	wisdom	in
it.	Whatever	you	do	shows	a	clarity,	a	purity,	a	spontaneity,	a	grace.
A	Mulla	Nasruddin	story....
He	was	born	in	Iran,	and	in	Iran	his	grave	is	still	there.	A	strange	grave,	unique
in	 the	 whole	 world.	 There	 are	 millions	 of	 graves,	 but	 nothing	 like	 Mulla
Nasruddin's	grave.	On	the	grave	there	is	standing	a	closed	door	with	a	big	lock
on	it.	And	the	lock...	Mulla	Nasruddin	before	dying	made	all	the	arrangements.
"You	put	the	key	with	me	inside	the	grave,	so	nobody	can	open	the	door."	Even
the	 emperor	 came	 to	 see	 --	 "What	 nonsense	 is	 happening!	 And	 this	 man	 is
thought	to	be	a	wise	man,	of	course	a	little	eccentric,	but	loved	by	everybody."
The	emperor	inquired	of	Nasruddin's	disciples,	"What	is	the	matter?"
They	said,	"It	is	not	new.	He	used	to	carry	this	door	wherever	he	went.	We	asked
him,
`What	is	the	matter?'	He	said,	Ìf	I	take	the	door	with	me,	nobody	can	enter	into
my	house.	Obviously,	everybody	enters	into	the	house	from	the	door.	So	just	to
protect	the	house,	I	carry	the	door	with	me.'	And	before	dying	he	said,	`Fix	that
door	on	my	grave,	lock	it,	and	put	the	key	with	me.	Any	time	I	like	I	can	open
the	door	and	just	have	some	fresh	air.'"
The	emperor	said,	"All	nonsense."
But	the	emperor	also	liked	the	man.	The	chief	disciple	said,	"There	is	something
in	 it.	He	 is	 saying:	Don't	 think	 that	my	death	 is	my	death.	You	are	putting	my
body	in	the	grave	but	I	am	still	alive.	My	life	is	eternal."
But	he	was	crazy	always.	To	make	this	statement,	that	life	is	eternal,	he	has	put
up	this	door:	"Any	moment,	if	I	want	to	come	out,	at	least	I	have	the	key	and	I
don't	have	to	ask	anybody's	permission.	I	can	open	the	door,	have	a	little	walk,	or
enjoy	around	the	city.
You	will	not	see	me,	but	I	will	see	you."
Mulla	Nasruddin	was	 once	 sent	 by	 the	 emperor	 of	 Iran	with	 great	 gifts	 to	 the
emperor	of	India.	And	Nasruddin	praised	the	emperor	of	India	as	the	full	moon.
The	rumor	reached	Iran	--	there	were	enemies	of	Nasruddin,	and	they	said,	"You
have	not	chosen	the	right	person	to	take	the	message.	He	has	praised	the	emperor
of	India	as	the	full	moon!"
The	emperor	 said,	 "Let	him	come	back.	He	will	 have	 to	 answer;	otherwise	he
will	lose	his	head."
Nasruddin	came	back.	The	Indian	emperor	was	very	impressed	by	him,	and	had
given	 him	 many	 presents.	 The	 emperor	 of	 Iran	 was	 very	 angry	 and	 he	 said,
"Nasruddin,	your	life	is	at	risk!"
Nasruddin	said,	"Everybody's	life	is	always	at	risk.	Do	you	think	your	life	is	not
at	risk?"
The	emperor	said,	"Don't	discuss	philosophy,	you	have	to	answer.	You	called	the
Indian	emperor	thèfull	moon.'	It	is	insulting	to	me."
Nasruddin	said,	"You	are	an	idiot;	you	don't	understand	the	meaning.	You	are	the
rising	moon,	 the	 first-day	moon,	which	 is	 just	 a	 small	 arc,	 remains	 for	 a	 few
moments	and	disappears.	The	full	moon	means	the	days	of	decline	have	come.
That	 Indian	 emperor	 was	 an	 idiot.	 He	 thought	 I	 was	 praising	 him,	 but	 I	 was
simply	declaring	that	`Your	time	has	come.	Now	there	is	no	more	growth,	only
decline.'	And	you	are	an	 idiot	 for	being	angry.	You	are	 the	 rising	moon	--	you
have	to	expand,	conquer.	You	have	enough	time	to	become	a	full	moon."
The	 emperor	 was	 very	 much	 impressed	 by	 the	 interpretation.	 Nasruddin's
enemies	were	simply	shocked.	They	had	never	 thought	 that	he	would	give	 this
interpretation.	Nobody	ever	thought	about	it;	everybody	thought	that	he	had	been
insulting.
Nasruddin	is	a	Sufi	mystic,	a	little	crazy,	but	always	tremendously	wise.	One	day
he	was	going	to	 take	his	disciples	 to	see	a	rare	collection	of	paintings	 that	had
come	to	the	city.
Now	 the	 question	 was...	 He	 would	 be	 riding	 on	 his	 donkey.	 He	 asked	 his
disciples,	"What	to	do?	If	I	ride	on	my	donkey	in	the	usual	way,	then	my	back
will	be	 towards	you.	That	 is	 insulting,	and	I	cannot	 insult	my	disciples.	 If	you
walk	ahead	of	me,	your	backs	will	be	towards	me.	I	don't	think	you	will	do	that
insult	to	me.	So	the	only	possible	way	is,	I	will	ride	on	the	donkey	facing	you."
The	disciples	said,	"But	 the	whole	 town	will	 laugh,	and	you	will	make	us	also
look	stupid...	 although	 there	 is	a	point	 in	 it.	But	 to	go	anywhere	with	you	 is	a
trouble."
The	 procession	 went	 on	 through	 the	 town.	 Everybody	 looked	 --	 what	 is	 the
matter?
Nobody	had	ever	seen	anybody	riding	on	a	donkey	facing	backwards.	Finally	a
crowd	 gathered,	 and	 they	 said,	 "We	 will	 not	 let	 you	 go	 unless	 we	 get	 the
explanation."
Nasruddin	said,	"The	explanation	is	simple.	I	don't	want	to	insult	my	disciples	so
I	 cannot	 have	my	 back	 towards	 them.	And	 I	 don't	want	 to	 be	 insulted	 by	my
disciples,	so	they	cannot	walk	ahead	of	me.	They	have	to	walk	behind	me.	Now
what	do	you	say	--	how	can	it	be	managed?	This	is	the	only	way."
People	said,	"It	is	crazy,	but	it	is	the	only	way.	If	keeping	somebody	at	your	back
is	insulting,	then	certainly	you	are	doing	the	right	thing."
A	simple	man	with	utter	purity	--	every	act	in	his	life	is	full	of	wisdom,	but	on
the	surface	looks	a	little	crazy.	He	belongs	to	the	same	category	as	Bodhidharma,
as	Mahakashyap.
But	he	is	a	little	more	eccentric	than	any	of	them.
From	 the	 emptiness	 of	 the	 heart,	 it	 is	 not	 necessary	 that	 what	 arises	 will	 be
understood	by	people	as	wisdom.	You	will	be	perfectly	at	ease	with	it,	and	those
who	understand	you	will	be	perfectly	at	ease	with	you.	But	in	this	world	to	find
people	who	can	understand	the	wisdom	of	the	empty	heart	is	very	difficult	and
rare.
But	there	is	no	problem.	The	man	of	empty	heart	does	not	need	any	recognition.
He	is	so	fulfilled	that	he	may	look	mad	to	the	whole	world,	but	if	it	is	arising	out
of	his	spontaneity,	it	does	not	matter.	All	that	matters	is	that	it	should	not	be	fake,
that	it	should	not	be	hypocrisy,	that	it	should	not	be	phony.	It	should	be	coming
out	 of	 your	 heart	 and	 its	 emptiness.	 Then	 everything	 is	 wise	 whether	 people
recognize	it	or	not.
Who	 has	 recognized	Mulla	Nasruddin?	Very	 few	people.	Who	 has	 recognized
Bodhidharma?	 Very	 few	 people.	Who	 has	 recognized	Mahakashyap	 suddenly
laughing?
Only	 Gautam	 Buddha.	 Ten	 thousand	 monks	 were	 present	 but	 nobody	 could
understand	 this	 eccentric	 behavior.	 But	 it	 was	 arising	 out	 of	 the	 empty	 heart,
from	a	clarity	of	vision.
Only	another	man	of	the	same	clarity	can	understand	it.
Maneesha,	 the	wisdom	of	 the	empty	heart	 is	understandable	only	 to	 those	who
have	 entered	 into	 their	 own	 emptiness.	 To	 others	 it	 will	 remain	 a	 puzzle,	 a
craziness,	a	madness.	And	there	are	so	many	beautiful	buddhas	--	their	behavior
was	absolutely	in	tune	with	the	emptiness	of	the	heart,	but	it	was	not	rational.	It
could	not	be	understood	by	the	so-called	intellectual.	It	was	almost	impossible	to
be	understood	by	the	crowd.
In	 Japan	 there	 is	 a	 doll...	 it	 is	 available	 anywhere,	 here	 too.	The	doll	 is	 called
daruma.
Daruma	 is	 a	 Japanese	 nickname	 for	 Bodhidharma,	 and	 the	 doll	 represents
something	special.	It	was	made,	so	goes	the	story,	by	Bodhidharma.	The	doll	is
made	in	such	a	way	that	its	bottom	is	very	heavy,	so	you	can	throw	it	any	way
and	 it	 will	 always	 fall	 and	 sit	 up	 immediately	 in	 the	 lotus	 posture.	 When
Bodhidharma	made	it,	his	disciples	laughed:
"What	are	you	doing?"
He	said,	"This	will	be	a	teaching	even	for	small	children	to	be	a	buddha	in	every
position,	 in	 every	 situation.	 Look	 at	 this	 doll;	 throw	 it	 any	 way	 and	 it	 will
immediately	regain	its	balance	and	sit	in	the	buddha	posture."
A	buddha	of	 the	category	of	Bodhidharma	can	make	a	doll	 far	more	 important
than	any	scripture.	The	tea	you	drink...	perhaps	you	don't	know	the	whole	story
of	 it.	Bodhidharma	was	meditating	on	a	mountain	 in	China	called	T'a.	And	he
did	not	want	to	blink	his	eyes,	but	it	is	natural	for	the	eyes	to	blink.	He	wanted	to
keep	his	eyes	open	while	he	was	meditating,	so	he	cut	off	his	eyelids	and	threw
them	just	 in	front	his	 temple.	From	the	hairs	of	 the	eyelids,	 the	first	 tea	 leaves
grew.
That	 is	 the	story.	It	 is	called	tea,	because	it	was	first	found	on	the	mountain	of
T'a	 and	 all	 the	 names	 in	 the	 different	 languages	 refer	 to	 the	mountain,	 T'a.	 In
Marathi	it	is	cha,	in	Hindi	it	is	chai.	But	it	originates	with	the	mountain,	T'a.	Of
course	 it	 is	 a	 fiction.	But	 because	 it	 grew	 out	 of	 the	 hairs	 of	Bodhidharma,	 it
keeps	you	awake.
So	when	you	want	to	be	awake...	just	a	cup	of	tea.	But	remember,	it	keeps	you
awake	because	it	is	a	product	of	Bodhidharma's	eyelids.	And	Bodhidharma	was
a	man	of	absolute	awareness,	so	some	quality	of	awareness	still	continues	in	tea.
It	is	a	beautiful	story,	and	its	implications	are	great.	Anything	that	comes	out	of
the	empty	heart	 and	 its	wisdom	 is	going	 to	 carry	 some	quality	 for	 the	 coming
centuries.	 It	may	 look	 like	a	 fiction	 --	 it	 is	a	 fiction.	But	even	a	 fiction	can	be
used	to	indicate	a	truth.	Tea	keeps	you	awake	because	Bodhidharma	was	a	man
of	fully	awakened	consciousness.
Even	 if	 you	watch	 Buddha's	 statue	 silently,	 you	will	 be	 surprised	 that	 slowly
your	mind	becomes	empty	and	you	start	entering	 into	your	own	spring	of	 life.
That	statue	is	made	exactly	in	the	posture	that	Gautam	Buddha	used	to	meditate
in.	Sitting	in	front	of	that	statue,	something	in	you	starts	synchronizing	with	the
posture	of	the	statue.	Doing	nothing,	just	sitting,	and	the	buddha	starts	reflecting
in	your	mirror.
But	the	mirror	has	to	be	clean,	the	mirror	has	to	be	empty	of	content.	That's	what
we	 are	 trying	 to	 do	 every	 day	 --	washing	 the	mirror,	 cleaning	 the	 dust	 of	 the
centuries.	Every	day	something	of	the	impurity	drops	away;	something	becomes
more	recognizable	as	a	buddha.	Maybe	just	a	glimpse,	but	soon	this	glimpse	will
become	your	whole	life.
Before	 you	 all	 become	 buddhas,	 a	 few	 laughters,	 because	 after	 becoming	 a
buddha,	laughter	does	not	suit.	No	buddha	laughs.	So	it	is	always	good	to	laugh
before	you	become	a	buddha,	because	if	you	laugh	when	you	are	a	buddha	it	will
be	objected	to.

"Uh...	 there	 are	 eight	 basic	 positions	 for	 sexual	 intercourse,"	Miss	 Goodbody
says	nervously.
"Nine,"	comes	Willy's	voice	from	the	back.
Flustered	 and	 blushing,	 Miss	 Goodbody	 begins	 again.	 "There	 are	 eight	 basic
positions	for	sexual	intercourse,"	she	stammers.
"Nine,"	interrupts	Willy,	again.
This	time	Miss	Goodbody	takes	a	deep	breath	and	continues,	"The	first	is	called
the	missionary	position:	the	man	is	on	top	of	the	woman	and	facing	her..."
"Aha!"	says	Willy,	winking	again,	"ten!"
Paddy	 and	Kowalski	 are	 in	 town	 for	 a	 drinking	 spree.	After	 a	 lot	 of	 drinking,
they	 decide	 to	 go	 to	 the	 hundred-story-high,	 revolving,	 Roasting	 Rhinoceros
Restaurant	for	some	dinner.
They	choose	a	table	overlooking	the	city	lights,	but	have	only	been	sitting	there
for	a	few	minutes	when	both	of	them	feel	the	need	to	pee.
"Can	you	tell	us	where	the	bathroom	is?"	Paddy	slobbers	at	the	head	waiter.
"Certainly,	sir,"	replies	the	waiter,	pointing	across	the	restaurant.	"Just	go	down
the	passage	over	there,	turn	left	and	go	two	steps	down."
The	directions	are	repeated	again	for	Kowalski,	who	is	not	quite	sure	he	knows
where	he	is,	or	what	he	is	looking	for.
"Just	remember,"	says	the	head	waiter,	"turn	left	and	two	steps	down..."
So,	 Paddy	 and	Kowalski	 set	 off	 across	 the	 room	 and	 down	 the	 passage.	They
take	the	first	door	on	the	left	and	step	inside,	into	the	open	elevator	shaft.
One	hundred	stories	below,	Paddy	slowly	picks	himself	up	off	the	ground.
"How	do	you	feel?"	Paddy	asks	his	Polack	friend,	lying	beside	him.
"Not	 too	 bad,"	 replies	Kowalski.	 "But	 I	 don't	 think	 I	 can	manage	 that	 second
step."
Nivedano...
Nivedano...
Be	silent,	close	your	eyes.	Feel	your	body	to	be	completely	frozen.
Look	inwards,	as	deep	as	possible.
It	is	your	own	space.
At	the	very	end	you	will	find	the	empty	heart.
The	 empty	 heart	 is	 a	 door	 to	 eternity.	 It	 is	 a	 connection	 between	 you	 and
existence.	It	is	not	something	physical	or	material.	It	is	not	something	mental	or
psychological.	It	is	something	beyond	both,	transcending	both.
It	is	your	spirituality.
Remember,	the	empty	heart	makes	you	a	buddha.
This	moment	is	blessed.
Ten	thousand	hearts	are	feeling	the	silence
and	the	merger	with	existence.
You	are	the	fortunate	ones	of	the	earth.
Make	it	clear,	Nivedano...
Relax...	just	be	a	watcher	of	mind	and	body	both.
The	insistence	should	be	on	the	witnessing.
Witnessing	is	your	secret	love.
Witnessing	is	Buddha,	watching.
Catch	hold	of	the	experience	so	that	when	you	come	back,	you	bring	something
out	of	your	depth	--	some	gold,	some	diamond,	some	splendor.
Nivedano...
Come	back,	but	come	back	with	a	new	richness,	with	a	new	integrity,	with	a	new
individuality.
Reborn,	 sit	 for	 a	 few	 moments	 recollecting	 the	 experience	 that	 you	 are	 the
buddha.
Okay,	Maneesha?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.
Can	we	celebrate	the	gathering	of	ten	thousand	buddhas?
Yes!

OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
A	LAYMAN	ASKED	BANKEI,	"THOUGH	I	AM	GRATEFUL	FOR	YOUR
TEACHING	 OF	 BIRTHLESSNESS,	 THOUGHTS	 FROM	 CONSTANTLY
APPLIED
MENTAL	HABITS	READILY	COME	UP,	AND	I	GET	LOST	IN	THEM	AND
HAVE
DIFFICULTY	 REMAINING	 CONTINUALLY	 UNBORN.	 HOW	 CAN	 I
APPLY
WHOLEHEARTED	FAITH?"
BANKEI	REPLIED,	"IF	YOU	TRY	TO	STOP	ARISING	THOUGHTS,	THE
STOPPING	MIND	 AND	 THE	 STOPPED	MIND	 BECOME	 SPLIT	 IN	 TWO
AND	YOU
NEVER	HAVE	ANY	 PEACE	OF	MIND.	 JUST	 TRUST	 THAT	 THOUGHTS
ARE
ORIGINALLY	NONEXISTENT	BUT	TEMPORARILY	ARISE	AND	CEASE,
CONDITIONED	BY	WHAT	IS	SEEN	AND	HEARD,	AND	HAVE	NO	REAL
SUBSTANCE."
ANOTHER	 LAYMAN	 ASKED,	 "WHEN	 I	 WIPE	 OUT	 ARISING
THOUGHTS,	THEY
KEEP	COMING	UP	FROM	THE	TRACES,	NEVER	STOPPING.	HOW	CAN	I
CONTROL	THESE	THOUGHTS?"
BANKEI	 REPLIED,	 "WIPING	 OUT	 ARISING	 THOUGHTS	 IS	 LIKE
WASHING
BLOOD	 WITH	 BLOOD;	 THOUGH	 THE	 FIRST	 BLOOD	 MAY	 BE
REMOVED,	THE
WASHING	 BLOOD	 STILL	 STAINS;	 NO	 MATTER	 HOW	 MUCH	 YOU
WASH,	THE
STAIN	IS	NOT	REMOVED.
"THIS	 NO-MIND	 IS	 ORIGINALLY	 UNBORN	 AND	 UNDYING	 AND
WITHOUT
ILLUSION.	NOT	REALIZING	THIS,	THINKING	THAT	THOUGHTS	ARE
EXISTENT	 THINGS,	 YOU	 ROAM	 AROUND	 IN	 THE	 ROUTINES	 OF
BIRTH	AND
DEATH.
"REALIZING	 THAT	 THOUGHTS	 ARE	 ONLY	 TEMPORARY
APPEARANCES,	 YOU	 SHOULD	 LET	 THEM	 BE	 AS	 THEY	 START	 AND
STOP,	WITHOUT
GRASPING	OR	REJECTING	THEM.	IT	IS	LIKE	IMAGES	REFLECTED	IN
A	MIRROR;	SINCE	THE	MIRROR	IS	CLEAR	AND	BRIGHT,	IT	REFLECTS
WHATEVER	COMES	BEFORE	IT,	BUT	DOESN'T	KEEP	THE	IMAGES.
"THE	 ENLIGHTENED	 NO-MIND	 IS	 INFINITELY	 BRIGHTER	 AND
CLEARER
THAN	 A	 MIRROR	 AND	 IS	 ALSO	 RADIANTLY	 AWARE,	 SO	 ALL
THOUGHTS
DISSOLVE	IN	THAT	LIGHT	WITHOUT	LEAVING	A	TRACE.	IF	YOU	CAN
BELIEVE	AND	TRUST	IN	THIS	TRUTH,	NO	MATTER	HOW	MUCH	THEY
COME
UP,	IT	WON'T	BE	A	HINDRANCE."
Maneesha,	 Gautama	 the	 Buddha	 marks	 a	 milestone	 in	 the	 history	 of
consciousness.	 The	 society	 and	 the	 religion	 and	 the	 civilization	 that	 existed
before	him	could	not	be	the	same	after	him.
It	is	just	a	Christian	obsession	to	make	Jesus	Christ	the	line	that	divides	the	past
from	the	present-day	society.	And	it	is	also	due	to	the	fact	that	the	East	has	never
written	 history.	 It	 has	 never	 been	 interested	 in	 historical	 facts	 for	 the	 simple
reason	that	if	everything	is	illusory,	changing,	what	does	it	matter	who	comes	to
rule?	What	does	 it	matter	what	happens	 in	 the	outside	world?	It	 is	not	 the	real
thing.
As	far	as	the	eternal	and	the	real	is	concerned,	it	is	timeless,	there	is	no	question
of	history	at	all.	History	can	be	only	of	outside	events,	it	cannot	be	of	the	inner.
And	 because	 the	 whole	 concentration	 of	 the	 East	 was	 on	 the	 inner,	 it	 never
bothered	 about	 history.	 Its	 concentration	 was	 directed	 more	 towards	 how	 to
express	 the	 inner	 to	 those	who	are	blind,	 to	whose	who	are	 living	 in	darkness.
How	to	bring	light	to	them?
We	don't	 know	how	many	buddhas	have	 remained	 silent.	We	don't	 know	how
many	buddhas	preceded	Gautam	Buddha.	We	have	simply	not	been	concerned
about	that	kind	of	thing	--	birth,	death...	all	those	things	are	ephemeral.	But	the
Western	 attitude	 is	 outward.	 And	 because	 Christianity	 became	 the	 world's
greatest	 religion,	 it	 has	 made	 Jesus	 Christ	 the	 dividing	 line	 between	 the
primitive,	 barbarian	 society	 and	 the	 society	 which	 exists	 now.	 That's	 why	we
always	refer	to	Jesus	--	"Before	Christ,"	or	"After	Christ."
Bertrand	Russell	was	writing	 the	history	of	 the	world.	He	was	confronted	with
the	idea	that	it	is	absolutely	unjustified	to	divide	the	development	of	society	with
the	 name	 of	 Jesus.	 The	 real	 division	 happened	 twenty-five	 centuries	 ago	with
Gautam	 Buddha.	 An	 authentic	 history	 should	 refer	 to	 Gautam	 Buddha.	 Any
incident	 has	 to	 be	 described	 as	 either	 "Before	 Gautam	 Buddha,"	 or	 "After
Gautam	Buddha."
There	 is	 no	 comparison	between	 Jesus	 and	Gautam	Buddha.	He	was	not	 even
claiming	that	he	was	enlightened;	he	had	not	even	heard	what	meditation	is.	He
was	only	claiming	that	he	was	the	last	prophet	of	the	Jews.	His	contribution	to
history	is	nothing.	But	Gautam	Buddha's	contribution	to	human	consciousness	is
immense,	immeasurable.
Bertrand	 Russell	 was	 a	 very	 impartial	 man.	 But	 still,	 childhood	 prejudices
dominate	 you	 even	 in	 your	 eighties,	 nineties.	 He	 had	 long	 before	 denied	 his
Christianity.	 He	 had	 written	 a	 book,	 WHY	 I	 AM	 NOT	 A	 CHRISTIAN,	 and
before	the	Christian	religion	expelled	him,	he	had	expelled	the	religion	himself.
So	he	was	not	an	orthodox	Christian,	or	even	a	Christian,	but	when	the	question
came	before	him,	of	what	to	do	with	Jesus	Christ	and	Gautam	Buddha,	he	writes
in	his	diaries:	"For	days	I	could	not	sleep.	 I	knew	that	 it	was	Gautam	Buddha,
but	my	deep	conditioning,	of	which	I	had	never	been	aware,	insisted	that	it	had
to	be	Jesus	Christ.	Jesus	Christ	is	ours;	Gautam	Buddha	is	a	foreigner."	Finally
he	conceded	to	his	conditioning.
Nobody	 before	 or	 after	 Bertrand	 Russell	 has	 confronted	 the	 problem.	 It	 still
continues.
Even	the	non-Christians	have	accepted	the	idea	that	history	is	divided	by	Jesus
Christ.
I	want	to	make	it	clear	to	you	that	Gautam	Buddha	is	the	dividing	line	from	the
past	--	his	past,	not	our	past.	Now	the	time	has	come	again;	twenty-five	centuries
are	enough.	And	that	is	what	his	calculation	was,	that	after	twenty-five	centuries
a	 new	 humanity	 should	 start,	 a	 new	man,	 a	 new	 culture,	 a	 new	 vision,	 a	 new
consciousness.	According	to	him	we	are	living	in	a	very	fortunate	time	--	a	time
of	tremendous	crisis,	but	of	great	challenges	and	uncountable	possibilities.
I	am	talking	about	Zen	simply	to	make	the	point	that	all	religions	are	now	out	of
date.
Zen	has	no	clingings	with	the	past.	It	is	not	a	by-product	of	the	past,	but	rather
an	opening	towards	the	future.	I	am	not	unnecessarily	wasting	my	time	and	your
time.	It	is	not	just	by	chance	that	I	have	chosen	to	speak	on	Zen.
We	have	come	to	a	point	of	departure	from	the	society	in	which	we	have	lived,	a
moment	of	tremendous	departure	for	consciousness.	The	way	man	has	felt	up	to
now	 has	 not	 been	 healthy.	 The	 way	 societies	 have	 structured	 themselves	 has
been	very	sick.	The	whole	civilization	is	almost	non-existential.
When	 H.G.	 Wells	 was	 asked,	 he	 said	 that	 civilization	 is	 a	 good	 idea,	 but
somebody	 has	 to	 do	 it	 --	 it	 has	 not	 happened	 yet.	 We	 are	 still	 living	 in	 the
shadows	of	barbarianism.
Gautam	Buddha	has	not	been	heard,	he	has	not	been	received	around	the	world.
It	seems	almost	as	if	he	is	a	mythological	figure.	He	is	one	of	the	most	integrated
persons,	the	most	awakened	human	beings	that	we	have	produced.
The	 future	 can	 be	 a	 discontinuity	 with	 our	 past	 only	 if	 the	 buddha	 is	 not	 a
difficult	and	arduous	achievement	--	and	he	is	not.	We	can	create	a	society	where
everyone	is	a	buddha.	I	don't	say	Buddhist,	that	is	an	ugly	word.	The	future	has
not	to	be	dominated	by	any	"ism."	But	just	 the	purity	and	grandeur	of	the	man
Buddha	is	so	alluring;	he	has	touched	the	highest	peak	possible	to	man.	And	he
has	made	 it	possible	now	for	every	man	 to	 touch	 that	highest	peak.	Whenever
one	man	reaches	 to	a	certain	point	 in	consciousness,	 that	point	becomes	easily
available	to	anybody	who	wants	to	seek	it.
Gautam	Buddha	 is	 a	 pioneer.	You	 don't	 have	 to	 go	 through	 all	 the	 difficulties
which	he	moved	 through.	He	had	 to,	 because	 there	was	 no	precedent.	But	 for
you	there	are	a	thousand	and	one	precedents.
Zen	has	produced	the	finest	masters,	and	they	are	all	proclaiming	a	discontinuity
with	the	past	and	bringing	a	new	man	--	the	buddha,	the	awakened	man,	a	man
who	 lives	 consciously.	 We	 are	 doing	 this	 great	 experiment.	 These	 are	 not
ordinary	 discourses	 or	 talks.	 I	 am	 not	 interested	 in	 any	 philosophy	 or	 any
political	 ideology.	 I	 am	 interested	 directly	 in	 transforming	 you	 who	 have
gathered	around	me.
This	 transformation	 is	 a	 simple	phenomenon,	once	understood.	What	has	been
asked	by	a	layman	to	the	master	Bankei	is	significant	for	you	all.
Bankei	is	in	a	way	a	very	simple	man,	not	speaking	in	philosophical	jargon	but
in	 day-today	 language,	 making	 very	 clear	 points.	 Even	 a	 little	 intelligence	 is
enough	 to	 understand	 him.	 He	 is	 a	 man	 who	 has	 been	 on	 the	 hilltops	 of
consciousness	and	has	returned	to	the	world	to	convey	the	message.
A	LAYMAN	ASKED	BANKEI,
"THOUGH	 I	 AM	 GRATEFUL	 FOR	 YOUR	 TEACHING	 OF
BIRTHLESSNESS,	THOUGHTS	FROM	CONSTANTLY	APPLIED	MENTAL
HABITS	READILY	COME
UP,	AND	I	GET	LOST	IN	THEM	AND	HAVE	DIFFICULTY	REMAINING
CONTINUALLY	 UNBORN.	 HOW	 CAN	 I	 APPLY	 WHOLEHEARTED
FAITH?"
Faith	is	a	wrong	translation.	Unfortunately	all	these	translations	have	been	done
by	Christian	missionaries.	There	must	have	been	a	word	which	was	something
like	trust,	not	faith.	But	to	the	Christian	both	seem	to	be	synonymous.
Just	a	few	days	ago	a	man	from	Japan	who	is	translating	one	of	my	books	on	the
Dhammapada	--	Gautam	Buddha's	greatest	scripture,	"the	path	of	religiousness"
--	wrote	to	me,	"I	was	surprised:	you	don't	know	Japanese,	you	don't	know	Pali,
you	don't	know	Sanskrit.	And	in	your	talks	on	the	Dhammapada,	in	many	places
you	 have	 changed	 words	 which	 have	 been	 put	 there	 by	 the	 Christian
missionaries."	 He	 was	 simply	 amazed	 because	 he	 looked	 in	 the	 Japanese
translations	and	he	found	that	I	was	right	every	time.	He	could	not	believe	how	a
man	 who	 does	 not	 understand	 Japanese	 can	 say	 that	 instead	 of	 `faith',	 there
should	be	the	word	`trust'.
I	can	understand	his	difficulty,	but	it	is	not	a	difficult	matter	for	me.	I	am	not	a
commentator.	When	 I	 speak	 on	 anyone,	 I	 have	 no	 commitment	 except	 to	my
own	understanding,	 to	my	own	illumination.	And	when	I	say	that	something	is
changed	in	a	wrong	way,	translated	wrongly,	it	does	not	mean	I	understand	the
Japanese	or	Chinese	from	which	the	translation	has	been	done.	It	simply	means
that	 I	 know	 the	 very	 heart	 of	 Gautam	 Buddha.	 I	 know	 the	 emptiness	 of	 that
heart,	it	is	my	own	experience.	No	master	who	has	touched	the	emptiness	of	the
heart	can	talk	in	terms	of	faith.	Faith	is	only	for	the	blind.
I	have	 told	you	 the	 story.	There	was	a	blind	man	who	was	a	great	 logician,	 in
Buddha's	time.	There	is	no	difficulty;	eyes	are	not	needed	to	be	a	logician.	And
because	he	was	a	great	logician,	nobody	could	prove	to	him	that	light	exists.	He
argued,	 and	 argued	 so	 clearly,	 "You	 are	 either	 just	 befooling	 yourself,	 or	 you
want	me	to	be	humiliated	as	a	blind	man.	But	I	say	there	is	no	light."
And	his	reasoning	was	very	clear,	crystal	clear.	He	said,	"I	am	ready	for	every
experiment.	I	want	to	touch	it	--	bring	me	to	where	there	is	light.	I	want	to	taste
it.	I	am	ready	to	smell	it,	I	am	ready	to	hear	the	sound	of	it."
Naturally	the	people	were	at	a	loss.	What	to	do	with	this	man?	He	is	blind	but	he
is	 a	 great	 debater.	 As	 far	 as	 arguments	 are	 concerned	 he	 is	 always	 a	 winner,
because	nobody	can	manage	to	make	the	sound	of	light;	nothing	like	that	exists...
the	taste	of	light,	or	the	touch	of	light.
Once	Gautam	Buddha	was	just	on	the	way	towards	the	capital	city	of	Vaishali,
and	he	passed	the	village	where	the	blind	man	lived.	People	thought,	"This	is	a
good	 opportunity.	 Perhaps	 this	 is	 the	 last	 opportunity	 --	 if	 this	man	 can	 even
defeat	 Buddha	 through	 his	 argumentation,	 then	we	 are	 finished!	 Perhaps	 light
does	not	exist.	Perhaps	we	are	dreaming	about	light."
That's	what	 he	 used	 to	 say	 to	 people,	 "You	 are	 dreaming.	 Just	 cool	 down,	 be
alert:	there	is	no	light,	all	is	darkness."
They	brought	the	man	to	Buddha.	They	thought	that	Buddha	would	argue	with
him,	 but	 instead	 of	 arguing,	Buddha	 said,	 "You	 have	 brought	 him	 to	 a	wrong
person.	 He	 does	 not	 need	more	 argumentation,	 because	 no	 argumentation	 can
prove	light.	He	needs	a	physician,	a	surgeon."
Buddha	had	his	own	personal	physician,	the	best	physician	of	those	days,	given
to	 him	 by	 the	 king	 of	 Vaishali.	 The	 physician	 followed	 him	 continuously	 for
forty-two	years,	till	his	last	breath,	just	like	a	shadow	taking	care	of	him.	He	was
fragile.
He	 said	 to	 his	 physician,	 "Take	 this	 case	 in	 your	 hands.	 I	 will	 be	 leaving
tomorrow	morning,	but	you	remain	behind	until	you	are	finished	with	this	case."
The	physician	looked	into	the	man's	eyes	and	he	said,	"It	will	not	be	much	time.
I	will	soon	catch	up	with	you.	His	eyes	are	only	covered	with	a	thin	layer	which
can	be	removed.	Within	a	few	weeks,	he	will	be	able	to	see	light."
And	after	six	weeks	the	physician	came	with	 the	man	to	another	village	where
Buddha	 had	 gone.	 The	 man	 came	 dancing.	 He	 fell	 unto	 the	 feet	 of	 Gautam
Buddha	and	he	said,
"Just	forgive	me.	I	could	not	believe	something	which	was	not	my	experience;	I
am	not	a	man	of	faith.	But	now	that	I	can	see	light,	a	tremendous	trust	has	arisen
in	me.	In	your	compassion	you	did	not	argue	about	it	but	you	simply	diagnosed
the	case	and	handed	me	over	to	the	physician."
Faith	is	for	the	blind;	trust	is	for	one	who	has	tasted	something	of	the	ultimate.
The	faithful	are	 the	 followers.	 I	don't	want	anybody	here	 to	believe	or	 to	have
faith.	 I	 want	 you	 to	 trust	 in	 yourself;	 that	 if	 Gautam	 Buddha	 can	 become	 an
Everest	 of	 consciousness,	 he	 has	 proved	 the	 point	 that	 every	 human
consciousness	has	the	same	potential.	Trust	in	it,	trust	in	yourself.
This	 distinction	 has	 to	 be	 remembered.	 Belief	 is	 always	 in	 somebody	 else's
ideology,	and	faith	is	in	somebody	else's	personality.
Trust	is	in	your	own	potentiality.
And	 because	 a	 man	 brings	 you	 to	 your	 potentiality,	 you	 have	 a	 tremendous
gratitude	 towards	him,	not	 faith.	But	unfortunately	only	Christian	missionaries
have	been	doing	the	work	of	translating;	nobody	else	is	interested	in	translating.
And	unconsciously,	they	bring	their	own	conditioning	--	which	is	of	faith	--	into
their	translations.	One	can	immediately	say	who	is	the	translator	of	any	passage.
Is	he	a	Christian,	or	a	Mohammedan,	or	a	Hindu,	or	a	Jaina?	Or	is	he	a	man	of
his	 own	 understanding,	 not	 belonging	 to	 any	 organized	 religion?	 Only	 a	man
who	knows	the	truth	can	give	a	translation	the	flavor	of	truth.
Christians	know	only	faith	--	"Have	faith	in	Jesus	Christ."	But	why	should	one
have	faith	in	Jesus	Christ?	Do	you	want	to	be	crucified?	--	because	that	must	be
the	ultimate	attainment!	And	 I	don't	 think	you	will	 resurrect;	neither	did	 Jesus
resurrect,	he	just	escaped	from	the	cave.
He	was	fortunate	enough	that	his	country,	Judea,	was	under	the	Roman	empire.
So	the	Roman	governor	Pontius	Pilate	was	not	interested	at	all	in	crucifying	an
innocent	neurotic.	A	man	who	claims,	"I	am	the	only	son	of	God"	can	only	be
thought	of	as	neurotic.	But	 it	 is	not	harmful,	 let	him	think	 it	 --	he	 is	not	doing
any	harm	to	anybody.
Pontius	Pilate	was	of	the	opinion	that	Jesus	was	innocent;	he	had	not	committed
any	crime,	and	if	he	enjoys	the	idea	that	he	is	the	only	begotten	son	of	God,	let
him	enjoy!
If	you	are	jealous,	you	can	have	some	other	idea,	"I	am	the	only	father	of	God."	I
don't	think	anybody	can	refute	you,	nobody	has	any	evidence.	It	is	just	the	same
as	being	the	son	of	God.	You	can	be	the	father	of	God,	or	the	brother	of	God.	It
is,	first	of	all,	your	imagination,	hallucination	--	it	is	innocent.
If	you	meet	somebody	who	says	to	you,	"Do	you	know,	I	am	the	father	of	God"
do	you	think	he	needs	to	be	crucified?	A	very	nice	fellow,	he	just	simply	utters	in
your	ear	a	truth	in	which	he	believes.	You	know	that	he	has	gone	off	the	tracks,
but	 that	 does	 not	 mean	 that	 he	 needs	 a	 crucifixion.	 He	 has	 to	 be	 enjoyed,
entertained	--	give	him	a	party	where	he	can	declare	"I	am	the	father	of	God."
Applaud	him,	and	dance	with	him,	because	 it	 is	so	rare	 to	find	a	God	and	you
have	found	the	father	of	God!	Maybe	he	can	give	you	some	clue	where	God	is
hiding.
The	Jews	were	too	serious.	Unnecessarily	they	harassed	Jesus;	he	had	not	done
any	harm	to	anybody.	But	every	organized	religion	has	an	ego,	a	great	ego.	Jesus
was	making	Judaism	a	laughingstock.	Riding	on	his	donkey,	moving	from	town
to	town,	declaring	"I	am	the	only	begotten	son	of	God"	--	it	was	not	a	crime,	but
it	was	hurtful	 to	 the	ego	of	 the	Jews.	"This	man	sitting	on	the	donkey...	a	poor
carpenter's	 son,	 and	 it	 is	well	 known	 that	 he	 is	 not	 born	of	his	 own	 father.	To
accept	him	as	our	last	prophet...?"
It	was	difficult	to	the	ego	of	the	Jews;	otherwise	it	was	an	innocent	affair.	There
was	no	need	to	be	angry	with	the	poor	fellow.	He	needed	psychiatric	treatment,
just	 good	 nourishment,	 care,	 and	 perhaps	 he	 might	 have	 come	 out	 of	 his
neurosis.
If	 I	meet	him	anywhere,	 just	a	single	"Yaa-Hoo"	and	he	will	come	down	from
the	donkey:	"You	can	take	my	donkey,	I	don't	want	to	argue!"	He	simply	needed
a	 little	 hypnotic	 treatment,	 a	 reconditioning,	 a	 reprogramming,	 and	 he	 would
have	been	perfectly	healthy	and	would	have	laughed	at	the	idea	himself.	But	half
of	 humanity	 believes	 and	 has	 faith	 in	 Jesus.	 This	 shows	 the	 retardedness	 of
mankind.
Certainly	this	phrase	"wholehearted	faith"	is	a	Christian	interpretation.	It	 is	not
the	 insight	 of	 those	 who	 are	 working	 on	 the	 path	 which	 Gautam	 Buddha
traveled.	It	is	not	a	path	of	belief	or	faith.	In	fact	you	have	to	throw	away	all	your
beliefs	and	all	your	 faiths.	You	have	 to	be	clean,	unburdened,	because	you	are
going	to	touch	the	heights.	All	these	burdens	will	hamper	your	progress.	You	are
going	to	know	truth	itself,	so	don't	carry	any	ideas	of	truth	because	those	ideas	of
truth	will	 stand	 between	 you	 and	 the	 truth.	 Be	 completely	 clean	 --	 that	 is	 the
meaning	of	the	empty	heart	of	the	buddha.
But	the	question	the	layman	is	asking	to	Bankei	is	important	for	you	all.	Except
for	 that	 one	 word,	 the	 whole	 question	 is	 important	 to	 every	 meditator.	 I	 will
repeat	it.
A	LAYMAN	ASKED	BANKEI,
"THOUGH	 I	 AM	 GRATEFUL	 FOR	 YOUR	 TEACHING	 OF
BIRTHLESSNESS,	THOUGHTS	FROM	CONSTANTLY	APPLIED	MENTAL
HABITS	READILY	COME
UP,	AND	I	GET	LOST	IN	THEM	AND	HAVE	DIFFICULTY	REMAINING
CONTINUALLY	 UNBORN.	 HOW	 CAN	 I	 APPLY	 WHOLEHEARTED
TRUST?"
This	 is	 the	difficulty	of	 every	meditator.	 In	different	names	 the	problem	 is	 the
same.	 The	 problem	 is	 that	 in	 your	meditations,	 for	 a	 split	 second	maybe	 you
have	 the	 glimpse,	 a	 taste	 of	 the	 eternal	 ecstasy.	 But	 you	 cannot	 keep
remembering	it	twenty-four	hours.	Old	habits,	the	old	mind	goes	on	interfering
in	many	 ways.	 It	 is	 a	 strange	 phenomenon	 because	 it	 is	 experienced	 only	 by
meditators.	 Non-meditators	 never	 experience	 it	 because	 they	 don't	 have	 the
context.
A	meditator	experiences,	but	when	he	comes	back	from	those	deep	layers,	back
to	his	ordinary	world,	to	the	circumference,	the	mind	starts	creating	doubt:	"You
have	been	dreaming.	What	nonsense	is	this	eternity?	Are	you	mad,	that	just	by
closing	 your	 eyes	 you	 attain	 to	 the	 ultimate	 truth?"	 The	 mind	 starts	 creating
doubts.
And	mind	is	your	old	friend	--	four	million	years	it	has	taken	to	develop.	Your
meditation	is	very	new,	very	fresh,	just	a	sprouting	seed;	your	mind	is	a	Lebanon
cedar,	two	hundred,	three	hundred	feet	tall,	almost	reaching	to	the	stars.
When	you	come	to	the	circumference	with	your	experience,	suddenly	there	is	a
conflict	 between	 the	 new	 experience	 and	 the	 old,	 four-million-year-old	 mind.
This	 mind	 will	 be	 almost	 like	 a	 mountain,	 and	 your	 experience	 is	 just	 a
roseflower.	So	again	and	again	you	will	get	caught	by	the	mind.
That's	what	 the	 layman	 is	 saying	 to	Bankei:	 "I	understand	your	 teaching,	 I	am
grateful	for	it.	But	it	is	very	difficult	to	remember	that	I	have	never	been	born,	I
have	never	died,	that	I	am	immortality	itself.	As	I	come	back	to	the	ordinary	life,
it	is	too	heavy	on	the	new	experience	which	is	just	a	bud	opening.	It	crushes	it
completely."
Most	meditators	drop	the	idea	after	a	few	days,	seeing	the	situation,	that	it	is	of
no	use.	It	is	just	a	glimpse	and	then	again	you	are	back	to	your	miserable	world.
And	the	miserable	world	is	so	powerful	that	you	even	start	suspecting	that	you
were	dreaming.	Your	own	experience	becomes	a	 faraway	echo,	as	 if	you	have
heard	somebody	else	 telling	you,	and	not	 that	you	have	experienced	 it.	 It	goes
against	your	whole	conditioning.
So	this	question	of	the	layman	is	the	question	of	all	meditators.
BANKEI	REPLIED,	"IF	YOU	TRY	TO	STOP	ARISING	THOUGHTS,	THE
STOPPING	MIND	 AND	 THE	 STOPPED	MIND	 BECOME	 SPLIT	 IN	 TWO
AND	YOU
NEVER	HAVE	ANY	 PEACE	OF	MIND.	 JUST	 TRUST	 THAT	 THOUGHTS
ARE
ORIGINALLY	NONEXISTENT	BUT	TEMPORARILY	ARISE	AND	CEASE,
CONDITIONED	BY	WHAT	IS	SEEN	AND	HEARD,	AND	HAVE	NO	REAL
SUBSTANCE."
He	 is	 saying	 that	 every	meditator	 comes	 to	 this	 point:	 he	 has	 known	 a	 small
space	 of	 thoughtlessness,	 so	 the	 natural	 conclusion	 seems	 to	 be	 that	 if	 he	 can
stop	the	thought	process,	 then	he	will	have	that	open	sky	again.	But	with	what
are	you	going	to	stop	the	thought	process?	Even	this	idea	of	stopping	the	thought
process	is	of	the	mind.	So	your	mind	becomes	split	in	two:	the	stopper	and	the
stopped.
Now	you	will	never	have	any	peace.	Your	own	mind	is	continuously	in	struggle:
one	 part	 is	 trying	 to	 stop	 it,	 another	 part	 is	 revolting	 against	 stopping.	 And
remember,	the	part	that	is	trying	to	stop	it	is	very	new	and	the	part	that	you	are
trying	to	stop	is	very	ancient.	In	this	struggle,	in	this	wrestling,	you	are	not	going
to	win.	Your	defeat	can	be	said	to	be	absolutely	certain.
Many	people	have	started	meditation	and	then	they	stopped	because	finally	they
see	 this	 and	 say,	 "What	 is	 the	 point	 of	 having	 one	 simple	 glimpse	 of	 joy?	 It
makes	life	even	more	terrible	in	comparison."	If	a	blind	man	for	one	second	sees
the	light	and	becomes	blind	again,	now	his	blindness	will	be	intolerable.	Now	he
knows	there	is	light,	and	he	is	unable	to	see	it	because	he	has	gone	blind	again.
A	meditator	has	 to	 remember	not	 to	struggle	with	 the	 thoughts.	 If	you	want	 to
win,	don't	fight.	That	is	a	simple	rule	of	thumb.	If	you	want	to	win,	simply	don't
fight.	The	thoughts	will	be	coming	as	usual.	You	just	watch,	hiding	behind	your
blanket;	let	them	come	and	go.	Just	don't	get	involved	with	them.
The	 whole	 question	 is	 of	 not	 getting	 involved	 in	 any	 way	 --	 appreciation	 or
condemnation,	 any	 judgment,	 bad	 or	 good.	 Don't	 say	 anything,	 just	 remain
absolutely	 aloof	 and	 allow	 the	 mind	 to	 move	 in	 its	 routine	 way.	 If	 you	 can
manage...	and	this	has	been	managed	by	thousands	of	buddhas,	so	there	is	not	a
problem.	 And	 when	 I	 say	 this	 can	 be	 managed,	 I	 am	 saying	 it	 on	 my	 own
authority.	I	don't	have	any	other	authority.
I	 have	 fought	 and	 have	 tortured	 myself	 with	 fighting	 and	 I	 have	 known	 the
whole	split	 that	creates	a	constant	misery	and	 tension.	Finally	 seeing	 the	point
that	 victory	 is	 impossible,	 I	 simply	 dropped	 out	 of	 the	 fight.	 I	 allowed	 the
thoughts	to	move	as	they	want;	I	am	no	longer	interested.
And	this	 is	a	miracle,	 that	 if	you	are	not	 interested,	 thoughts	start	coming	less.
When	you	are	utterly	uninterested,	they	stop	coming.	And	a	state	of	no-thought,
without	any	fight,	is	the	greatest	peace	one	has	ever	known.	This	is	what	we	are
calling	the	empty	heart	of	the	buddha.
ANOTHER	 LAYMAN	 ASKED,	 "WHEN	 I	 WIPE	 OUT	 ARISING
THOUGHTS,	THEY
KEEP	COMING	UP	FROM	THE	TRACES,	NEVER	STOPPING.	HOW	CAN	I
CONTROL	THESE	THOUGHTS?"
It	seems	that	Bankei	has	authentic	disciples	interested	in	meditation,	because	all
their	questions	are	the	eternal	questions	of	meditators.	The	questioner	is	saying,
"WHEN	 I	 WIPE	 OUT	 ARISING	 THOUGHTS,	 THEY	 KEEP	 COMING	 UP
FROM	THE
TRACES,	 NEVER	 STOPPING.	 HOW	 CAN	 I	 CONTROL	 THESE
THOUGHTS?"
The	 very	 idea	 of	 control	 is	 of	 fight.	 The	 very	 idea	 of	 control	 makes	 you
involved.	You	don't	have	 to	stop	 them,	you	don't	have	 to	wipe	 them	out.	They
will	 come	 back!	 You	 don't	 have	 to	 control	 them,	 because	 the	 very	 effort	 of
controlling	 them	will	 keep	 you	 engaged	 in	 the	 process	 of	 controlling...	 and	 a
strange	fact	 to	be	remembered	is	 that	 the	master	 is	as	much	a	slave	to	his	own
slave	 as	 the	 slave	 is	 a	 slave	 to	 the	 master.	 If	 you	 manage	 to	 control	 your
thoughts,	you	are	stuck	with	control.	You	cannot	leave	that	place,	you	cannot	go
away	 for	 a	 holiday.	 You	 are	 controlling	 your	 thoughts	 and	 your	 thoughts	 are
controlling	you.
You	cannot	move	into	meditation	by	controlling.
You	can	move	into	meditation	only	by	being	indifferent,	just	a	watcher.	Whether
it	 comes	 or	 not	 makes	 no	 difference;	 just	 let	 the	 thoughts	 flow	 on	 their	 own
accord	and	you	 stand	aloof,	 just	watching.	The	word	 `watching'	 simply	means
being	a	mirror,	reflecting	and	not	making	any	commentary.	No	mirror	makes	any
commentary.	No	mirror	says	to	you,
"Aha,	how	beautiful!"	It	is	not	interested	in	whether	you	are	beautiful	or	weird,
sane	or	insane,	standing	on	your	feet	or	on	your	head.	It	makes	no	difference	to
the	mirror,	the	mirror	simply	reflects.
The	watcher	 is	 a	mirror.	 It	 simply	watches	 and	 remains	 empty.	 No	 content	 is
caught	by	the	mirror.	Things	come	and	go,	the	mirror	does	not	cling	to	anything.
The	mirror	is	not	in	favor	of	something	or	against	it.	It	has	no	notions	about	what
passes	before	it.
I	have	heard	about	a	Hassid	rabbi...	Hassidism	comes	closest	to	Zen.	It	is	a	small
branch	 of	 rebellious	 Jews.	 They	 are	 not	 accepted	 by	 the	 orthodox,	 by	 the
organized	 religion,	 but	 they	 have	 a	 small	 lineage	 of	 very	 beautiful	 people.	 If
Judaism	has	contributed	anything	 to	humanity,	 it	 is	Hassidism	--	although	they
will	not	accept	it.	They	condemn	the	Hassids	because	they	are	doing	everything
unorthodox,	 untraditional	 --	 not	 conforming	 to	 the	 organized	 religion,	 being
independent	and	rebellious.
This	Hassid	mystic	was	walking	in	the	middle	of	the	night	towards	the	river,	just
to	sit	silently	 there.	A	watchman	of	a	great	palace	used	to	see	him	come	every
night	 at	 midnight.	 Finally	 it	 became	 impossible	 to	 resist,	 and	 the	 watchman
stopped	the	Hassid	and	asked	him,	"I	have	been	watching	for	months.	Not	even	a
single	night	have	you	missed;	you	go	every	night	at	midnight	towards	the	river.
What	 are	 you	 doing?	 I	 have	 seen	 you,	 I	 have	 followed	 you,	 because	 it	 is	my
work	 to	 keep	watch	 around	 the	palace	 and	 at	 first	 I	was	 suspicious.	This	man
comes	 every	 night,	 passes	 by	 the	 palace...	 so	 I	 have	 followed	 you,	 but	 you
simply	don't	take	any	note	of	the	palace	or	anybody	following	you.	You	simply
go	to	the	river	and	sit	on	the	bank	for	hours.	What	are	you	doing	there?"
The	Hassid	said,	"I	am	also	a	watchman.	Just	as	you	are	watching	the	palace,	I
am	watching	my	own	mind."
As	the	watching	grows,	without	any	struggle,	the	thoughts	disappear.	And	when
the	heart	is	empty,	you	are	the	buddha.
BANKEI	 REPLIED,	 "WIPING	 OUT	 ARISING	 THOUGHTS	 IS	 LIKE
WASHING
BLOOD	WITH	BLOOD..."
I	 told	 you,	 he	 is	 a	 very	 simple	 man.	 Without	 philosophical	 jargon,	 he	 has
managed	 simply,	 in	 ordinary	 day-to-day	 language,	 to	 say	 something	 very
significant.
WIPING	 OUT	 ARISING	 THOUGHTS	 IS	 LIKE	WASHING	 BLOOD	WITH
BLOOD;	 THOUGH	 THE	 FIRST	 BLOOD	 MAY	 BE	 REMOVED,	 THE
WASHING	BLOOD
STILL	 STAINS;	 NO	MATTER	 HOW	MUCH	 YOU	WASH,	 THE	 STAIN	 IS
NOT
REMOVED.
Fighting	 with	 thoughts	 is	 simply	 removing	 thoughts	 with	 thoughts,	 washing
blood	with	blood.	This	idea	is	also	a	thought,	that	there	should	be	no	thoughts,
that	 "I	 don't	 want	 any	 thoughts."	 That	 is	 also	 a	 thought.	 The	 watcher	 is	 not
allowed	to	have	even	this	prejudice.
If	 they	 are	 there,	 he	 is	 happy.	 If	 they	 are	 not	 there,	 he	 is	 happy.	He	 is	 simply
unconcerned.
THIS	 NO-MIND	 IS	 ORIGINALLY	 UNBORN	 AND	 UNDYING	 AND
WITHOUT
ILLUSION.	NOT	REALIZING	THIS,	THINKING	THAT	THOUGHTS	ARE
EXISTENT	 THINGS,	 YOU	 ROAM	 AROUND	 IN	 THE	 ROUTINES	 OF
BIRTH	AND
DEATH.
Bankei	 is	 saying,	 if	 you	know	a	 silent	moment	when	 there	 is	 no	 thought,	 you
will	 be	 able	 to	 see	 that	 these	 thoughts	 are	 not	 realities.	 They	 are	made	 of	 the
same	stuff	as	dreams	are	made	of.	They	are	waking	dreams.	You	don't	have	to
fight	 with	 them,	 you	 have	 just	 to	 watch	 silently.	 As	 your	 watching	 becomes
deeper,	 they	will	start	disappearing.	And	in	 their	place	arises	 the	experience	of
no-mind,	of	emptiness,	ORIGINALLY	UNBORN
AND	 UNDYING	 AND	 WITHOUT	 ILLUSION.	 NOT	 REALIZING	 THIS,
THINKING
THAT	 THOUGHTS	 ARE	 EXISTENT	 THINGS,	 YOU	 ROAM	AROUND	 IN
THE
ROUTINES	OF	BIRTH	AND	DEATH.
It	 is	your	mind	which	has	been	 taking	you	 through	birth	and	death	 in	a	circle,
again	and	again,	one	misery	after	another	misery.	You	have	to	jump	out	of	this
circle	--	and	the	only	way	to	jump	out	is	simply	to	witness.
REALIZING	 THAT	 THOUGHTS	 ARE	 ONLY	 TEMPORARY
APPEARANCES,	YOU
SHOULD	 LET	 THEM	 BE	 AS	 THEY	 START	 AND	 STOP,	 WITHOUT
GRASPING	OR
REJECTING	THEM.
Don't	do	anything	at	all.
IT	IS	LIKE	IMAGES	REFLECTED	IN	A	MIRROR;	SINCE	THE	MIRROR	IS
CLEAR
AND	 BRIGHT,	 IT	 REFLECTS	 WHATEVER	 COMES	 BEFORE	 IT,	 BUT
DOES	NOT
KEEP	THE	IMAGES.
Just	be	a	mirror.
THE	 ENLIGHTENED	 NO-MIND	 IS	 INFINITELY	 BRIGHTER	 AND
CLEARER
THAN	 A	 MIRROR	 AND	 IS	 ALSO	 RADIANTLY	 AWARE,	 SO	 ALL
THOUGHTS
DISSOLVE	IN	THAT	LIGHT	WITHOUT	LEAVING	A	TRACE.	IF	YOU	CAN
BELIEVE	AND	TRUST	IN	THIS	TRUTH,	NO	MATTER	HOW	MUCH	THEY
COME
UP,	IT	WON'T	BE	A	HINDRANCE.
Again,	I	object	to	the	word	`belief'.	There	is	no	need.	You	are	watching	and	you
are	seeing	that	the	thoughts	are	disappearing	like	shadows.	It	is	your	experience.
This	sentence	again	brings	the	Christian	mind	in.	IF	YOU	CAN	BELIEVE	AND
TRUST	IN
THIS	TRUTH....	Truth	needs	no	trust,	no	belief.	You	simply	know	it.	And	once
you	have	come	to	know	it,	you	have	attained	freedom.
This	 knowing	 is	 not	 something	 like	 knowledge.	 This	 knowing	 is	 a
transformation.	You	 have	moved	 from	 the	mind	 to	 no-mind.	You	 have	moved
from	 the	body	 to	no-body.	You	have	moved	 from	form	 to	 formlessness.	 It	 is	a
transformation.	There	is	no	question	of	believing	or	trusting	or	having	faith.	But
I	can	understand	the	poor	translator's	difficulty.
He	is	doing	his	best,	but	his	conditionings	pop	up	here	and	there,	unintentionally.
I	don't	blame	 these	 translators,	but	 they	have	created	a	difficulty	 for	 the	West.
Just	 reading	 them,	 the	 Western	 mind	 will	 not	 be	 able	 to	 understand	 exactly
where	they	have	translated	wrongly.	I	can	see	where	they	are	wrong.	And	I	can
indicate	 to	 you	 that	when	 you	 see,	 you	 see;	when	 you	 know,	 you	 know	 --	 no
belief,	 no	 faith.	 Those	 are	words	 belonging	 to	 the	world	 of	 the	 blind.	We	 are
entering	into	the	world	of	the	buddhas.
A	 haiku...	 just	 a	 small	 statement,	 but	 far	 more	 valuable	 than	 great	 holy
scriptures:	WHEN	THE	DREAMER	WAKENS
HE	IS	ABSOLUTE	ABSENCE.
You	wake	up	every	day	--	you	have	this	experience	--	and	the	moment	you	wake
up,	dreams	are	 absent.	This	 is	not	 the	ultimate	waking.	When	you	wake	up	 in
meditation,	not	only	are	dreams	absent,	you	are	absent.	Your	absence	makes	 it
the	empty	heart	of	the	buddha.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
YESTERDAY,	I	REMEMBERED	TO	REMEMBER	MY	EMPTINESS	MORE
OFTEN
THAN	 ANY	 OTHER	 DAY.	 I	 REMEMBERED	 AT	 THE	 TAILOR'S	 --	 A
CRUCIAL
CRITERION.	I	EVEN	REMEMBERED	DURING	RUSH	HOUR	AT	MARIAM
CANTEEN	--	THE	ULTIMATE	TEST.
I	 HAVE	 UNDERSTOOD	 YOU	 TO	 SAY	 THAT	 THROUGH	 MAKING	 AN
EFFORT,	 BY	 AND	 BY	 WE	 WILL	 INSTILL	 IN	 OURSELVES	 A	 SELF-
PERPETUATING
AWARENESS	THAT	FINALLY	DOES	NOT	NEED	OUR	ACTIVE
REMEMBRANCE;	 IT	WILL	 HAVE	 BECOME	A	 CONSTANT	 BACKDROP
TO	ALL
WE	DO.
THIS	 MUST	 BE	 DIFFERENT	 FROM	 SIMPLY	 CULTIVATING	 A	 GOOD
HABIT,	BUT	JUST	HOW	IS	IT	DIFFERENT?
Maneesha,	 it	 is	 absolutely	different	 from	cultivating	a	good	habit.	You	are	not
cultivating	 anything,	 you	 are	 simply	 remembering.	You	 are	 remembering	 your
own	experience.	In	cultivating	a	good	habit,	you	don't	know	whether	it	is	really
good	 or	 just	 a	 social	 convenience.	You	 don't	 know	who	 has	 decided	 that	 it	 is
good,	because	in	every	society,	culture,	civilization,	different	things	are	thought
to	be	good	and	different	things	are	thought	to	be	bad.
Cultivating	 a	 good	 habit	 is	 cultivating	 something	 borrowed	 --	 that	 is	 the
difference.	I	am	not	telling	you	to	cultivate,	I	am	telling	you	to	remember	your
own	experience	as	much	as	possible.	Whenever	it	is	possible,	remember	it.	Give
it	more	nourishment.
It	 is	 just	 like	watering	a	rosebush,	giving	nourishment	to	your	own	experience.
The	good	habit	is	not	your	experience.
You	should	have	a	look	at	`good	habits.'	They	are	all	social	conveniences.	And
they	create	a	certain	personality	in	you	which	is	not	authentic;	it	does	not	arise
from	your	self.
It	comes	from	others	--	parents,	teachers,	priests,	social	leaders.
Anything	 that	 comes	 from	 outside	 you,	 beware	 of	 it!	 However	 good	 it	 may
seem,	 anything	 cultivated	 makes	 you	 a	 hypocrite.	 I	 want	 you	 to	 be	 non-
hypocritical.	I	want	you	to	be	authentically	yourself.	It	is	not	a	cultivation,	it	is
simply	a	remembrance	of	your	own	intrinsic	nature.
The	buddha	is	not	a	foreigner	to	you;	he	is	sitting	exactly	at	the	center	of	your
consciousness.	 We	 have	 to	 constantly	 look	 within	 so	 that	 it	 becomes	 almost
natural,	a	flowing	current.	You	don't	have	to	do	anything,	it	is	there.	That's	why	I
say	it	is	the	simplest	thing	and,	unfortunately,	because	it	is	the	most	simple	and
the	most	obvious,	it	has	been	neglected.	Nobody	bothers	about	who	you	are.	You
yourself	don't	bother.
There	was	a	great	fair,	and	Mulla	Nasruddin	went	to	the	fair.	There	was	no	place
in	any	hotel.	One	manager	took	pity	on	him	and	said,	"If	you	are	ready	to	share	a
room,	I	can	manage	to	convince	this	person,	who	is	a	gentleman	--	 it	 is	a	two-
bed	room	which	he	is	occupying."
Nasruddin	had	no	objection;	he	said,	"It	is	perfectly	good	for	me,	if	he	is	ready."
The	other	man	was	perfectly	 ready	also,	and	he	said,	 "There	 is	no	problem.	A
tired	man,	going	from	hotel	to	hotel...	there	is	no	problem.	I	am	going	to	sleep,
and	he	is	going	to	sleep."
Nasruddin	entered	the	room,	said	to	the	man,	"Hi!"	And	then,	wearing	his	shoes,
his	turban,	his	coat,	everything	just	as	he	was	when	he	had	come	in,	he	went	to
bed.	The	man	looked	a	little	surprised!	And	of	course,	with	shoes	and	turban	and
coat	you	cannot	sleep,	you	cannot	relax.	So	Mulla	was	moving	from	side	to	side,
and	because	of	his	movement	the	other	man	could	not	sleep.	The	other	man	said,
"Listen,	fellow,	I	have	never	seen	anybody	sleeping	in	his	shoes."
Mulla	Nasruddin	said,	"Neither	have	I	heard	of	anybody,	but	I	am	in	trouble:	I
love	to	sleep	naked	just	as	you	are	sleeping	naked..."
The	man	said,	"What	is	the	trouble?"
"The	trouble	is,	I	recognize	myself	with	my	turban,	with	my	coat,	with	my	shoes.
If	 I	 am	 naked,	 in	 the	 morning	 who	 is	 going	 to	 decide	 who	 is	 who?	 You	 are
naked,	I	am	naked.
Neither	do	I	know	who	I	am,	nor	do	you	know."
The	man	said,	"The	problem	is	really	great!	But	some	solution	has	to	be	found,
because	I	have	to	sleep."
So	 he	 found	 a	 small	 toy	 that	 some	 baby	 must	 have	 left	 behind	 before	 they
occupied	the	room.	He	took	the	toy	and	he	said,	"Let's	do	one	thing:	I	will	tie	it
to	your	foot,	so	you	will	know	that	you	are	the	man	with	the	toy."
Nasruddin	said,	"A	great	genius	you	are!	Otherwise	I	was	thinking	I	would	die
this	night,	suffocating,	in	the	coat	and	the	shoes."	So	he	removed	everything	and
the	man	tied	the	toy	to	his	foot.	Nasruddin	started	snoring	immediately.
Then	the	man	had	an	idea..."Let	us	see	what	happens."	He	changed	the	toy,	tied
it	to	his	own	foot,	and	went	to	sleep.	In	the	morning	there	was	havoc!	Nasruddin
was	running	out	in	the	open	--	the	whole	hotel	gathered.
The	manager	said,	"What	is	the	matter?"
He	said,	"The	matter	is	so	metaphysical.	I	had	gone	to	sleep	with	the	idea	that	I
am	the	man	with	the	toy.	Certainly	I	am	not	the	man	with	the	toy;	the	other	man
has	the	toy.	The	problem	is,	if	I	am	not	Nasruddin,	who	am	I?	Certainly	I	am	not
Nasruddin	because	I	had	the	toy;	that	was	my	symbol."
The	 other	 fellow	was	 awakened	 and	 asked,	 "Do	 you	 know	who	 you	 are?"	He
said,	"I	know	only	that	I	am	the	man	with	the	toy."
Nasruddin	said,	"I	had	told	you	before	that	it	was	going	to	create	trouble!	Now
for	my	whole	life	I	am	going	to	live	not	knowing	who	I	am.	You	are	Nasruddin,
okay	--	what	about	me?"
We	can	laugh,	but	that	is	how	we	know	ourselves.	What	is	your	identity?	Just	a
certain	face,	which	goes	on	changing.	Fortunately	it	does	not	change	in	jumps	--
it	does	not	know	about	sudden	enlightenment,	it	only	knows	about	the	gradual.	It
goes	on	changing,	but	very	gradually	so	you	don't	feel	that	it	is	a	different	face.
When	you	go	to	bed	you	have	one	face;	when	you	wake	up	in	the	morning,	it	is
not	the	same	face.	But	because	the	change	is	so	gradual,	you	don't	take	note	of	it.
Otherwise	 everything	 is	 changing:	 your	 moustache	 is	 growing,	 your	 beard	 is
growing,	your	face	is	becoming	older.	Everything	in	you	is	a	flux	--	but	it	is	very
gradual,	so	it	seems	almost	at	a	standstill.	Otherwise,	you	don't	have	any	identity.
If	 things	 were	 jumping	 so	 fast	 that	 in	 the	 night	 you	 go	 to	 sleep	 and	 in	 the
morning	you	wake	up	and	find	somebody	else's	face...	You	look	in	the	mirror	--
"My	god,	this	was	never	my	face!"	Or	you	had	been	a	man	and	now	you	are	a
woman....
Nature	 has	 managed	 things	 to	 change	 very	 gradually	 but	 the	 change	 is
happening,	you	have	to	be	reminded.	And	you	can	feel	this	change	only	if	you
know	something	within	you	which	is	unchanging.	Against	the	unchanging,	you
can	see	the	changing.
That	 witness	 is	 the	 only	 unchanging	 element	 in	 the	 whole	 of	 existence.	 And
when	you	become	a	witness	and	a	great	clarity	arises	in	you,	even	small	changes
in	you	are	taken	note	of,	they	reflect.	You	don't	take	any	care	of	any	change,	but
your	mirror	goes	on	reflecting	how	you	are	becoming	older,	how	you	are	moving
from	 life	 to	death,	 from	death	 to	another	womb.	Your	mirror	 in	 its	 clarity	will
allow	 you	 to	 know	 that	 you	 are	 a	 river,	 not	 a	 tank	 of	water	where	 nothing	 is
moving.
Maneesha,	 the	 good	 habit	 has	 to	 be	 cultivated;	 you	 have	 to	 force	 it	 upon
yourself.	 It	 is	 just	 a	 thin	 layer	 --	 just	 a	 small	 scratch	 and	you	will	 forget	 your
good	habit	and	your	natural	response	will	come	out.	And	your	natural	response
is	 going	 to	 be	 barbarous	 because	 you	 have	 never	 gone	 beyond	 your
barbarousness.
Meditation,	to	me,	is	the	only	civilization,	the	only	culture,	the	only	religion.	It
takes	you	beyond	everything,	above	 the	clouds,	and	you	can	see	everything	 in
you	 from	 a	 bird's-eye	 view.	 You	 need	 not	 repeat	 anything;	 now	 you	 can	 be
original,	 responsible.	And	 to	me	 that	 is	 the	only	good	 in	existence:	 to	 respond
with	awareness,	to	respond	spontaneously,	not	through	cultivation.
I	have	heard	about	a	man	who	was	of	such	an	angry	temper	that	he	killed	his	boy
because	he	had	disobeyed.	And	he	forced	his	wife	to	jump	into	the	well	because
she	was	trying	to	protect	the	child.	The	whole	village	gathered	and	the	man	was
very	much	ashamed.	He	was	so	much	ashamed	that	he	said,	"I	will	renounce	the
world.	I	am	going	to	become	a	saint."	A	Jaina	monk	was	in	the	city.	He	went	to
the	monk,	and	the	monk	said,	"It	is	a	very	difficult	path."
The	man	 said,	 "Nothing	 is	 difficult	 for	me.	You	can	understand	 --	 I	 killed	my
child,	I	forced	my	wife	to	jump	into	the	well.	Do	you	think	anything	is	difficult
for	me?"
The	Jaina	monk	said,	"You	will	have	to	be	naked."
The	 man	 immediately	 threw	 his	 clothes;	 even	 the	 monk	 was	 shocked	 and
surprised.	 But	 he	 did	 not	 understand	 that	 this	was	 also	 his	 angry	 temper.	 The
monk	 initiated	 him,	 and	 he	 became	 very	 famous.	 He	 was	 given	 the	 name
Shantidas;	the	name	means	`servant	of	peace'.
After	 twenty	years...	he	was	 in	New	Delhi.	One	of	his	friends	from	the	village
happened	 to	 be	 in	New	Delhi,	 so	 he	 thought,	 "It	will	 be	 good	 to	 see	 how	 far
Shantidas	has	gone."
So	he	went	to	see	him	--	there	was	a	big	crowd	of	worshippers.	Shantidas	looked
at	him...
and	he	recognized	him,	but	he	did	not	show	any	sign	of	recognition.	A	man	of
his	 stature	 cannot	 recognize	 a	 villager,	 although	 they	 have	 been	 friends.	 The
other	 man	 immediately	 understood:	 "Nothing	 has	 changed,	 because	 he	 has
looked	at	me	as	if	he	has	not	recognized	me	--	but	he	has	recognized	me.	I	can
see	it	on	his	face."
So	the	man	came	close	and	said,	"I	have	a	simple	question	to	ask.	What	is	your
name?"
This	 irritated	 Shantidas	 very	much.	He	 said,	 "You	 don't	 read	 the	 newspapers?
The	whole	capital	knows	my	name.	My	name	is	Muni	Shantidas."
The	man	said,	"My	memory	is	very	bad.	Will	you	please	repeat	it?"
Now	 this	 was	 too	much.	 He	 said,	 "I	 have	 told	 you!	 And	 I	 will	 repeat	 it,	 but
remember:	 if	 you	 ask	 again...	 You	 know	 me	 perfectly	 well.	 My	 name	 is
Shantidas."
The	man	said,	"Just	once	more."
And	Shantidas	took	his	staff	and	said,	"Once	more	and	I	will	kill	you!"
The	man	said,	 "There	 is	no	need	 to	do	 that	great	work.	 I	 just	wanted	 to	know
whether	you	had	changed."
Twenty	years	of	cultivation	of	all	the	virtues,	and	just	a	little	scratch	and	the	old
man	comes	out.	All	our	morality,	all	our	cultivation	is	superficial.	My	interest	is
not	in	any	superficial	cultivation	but	in	a	revolution,	radical,	which	comes	out	of
your	meditation.
Before	 we	 go	 into	meditation...	 You	 will	 be	 going	 to	 a	 faraway	 space	 within
yourself.
Just	go	laughing	and	joyous.	Seriousness	I	hate	--	I	am	really	serious!	I	want	my
buddhas	to	be	dancing	and	singing	and	enjoying.	I	want	my	buddhas	not	 to	be
marble	statues	but	living	and	breathing	and	loving.
Paddy	and	Seamus	are	at	 the	bar	of	 the	Pickled	President	pub.	Paddy	is	 telling
Seamus	all	about	his	recent	trip	to	America.
"You	know,"	says	Paddy,	"that	guy	Ronald	Reagan,	the	president	of	America?"
"Yes,"	 replies	 Seamus,	 scratching	 his	 head.	 "He's	 that	 old	 goat	 with	 the	 pet
chimpanzee,	right?"
"Right,"	 says	Paddy.	 "Well,	he	has	got	an	office	 in	 this	place	called	 the	White
House."
"Really?"	says	Seamus.	"Is	it	like	the	White	House	pub?"
"Probably,"	says	Paddy,	"but	in	his	office,	on	his	desk,	he	has	got	a	button.	He
just	has	to	push	the	button,	and	--	boom!	--	the	world	is	finished!"
"That	 doesn't	 sound	 like	 a	 good	 idea	 at	 all,"	 says	 Seamus,	 slurping	 at	 another
beer.	"My	grandfather	is	less	senile	than	that	Ronald	Reagan,	and	we	don't	even
allow	him	to	push	the	buttons	on	the	television!"
Pope	the	Polack	finds	that	his	Catholic	Christian	empire	is	crumbling.	He	orders
all	the	Vatican	researchers	to	try	and	find	a	solution	to	this	impending	disaster.
One	day,	Cardinal	Catzass	comes	charging	into	the	papal	office.
"I've	got	it!	I've	got	it!"	screams	Catzass.	"In	one	of	the	old	manuscripts,	it	says
that	God	has	left	his	final	message	on	a	tiny	planet	at	the	edge	of	the	universe,
called	Hysteria."
Desperate,	Pope	 the	Polack	empties	out	 the	 safe	of	Banco	Vaticano,	 and	gives
the	money	to	the	Russians	to	build	him	a	rocket	to	take	him	to	Hysteria.
After	weeks	of	 training,	Pope	 the	Polack,	Cardinal	Catzass,	 and	 a	 chimpanzee
pilot,	blast	off	from	earth	and	hurtle	through	space	towards	the	distant	planet.
Light	 years	 later,	 they	 land	 at	 a	 tiny	 spaceport	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 Hysteria
desert,	 and	 the	 Polack	 pope	 does	 his	 thing	 kissing	 the	 dirt.	 On	 a	 signpost	 is
written	the	words:	"God's	last	message	--	forty	miles."
In	full	regalia,	with	his	shepherd's	staff,	rocket-shaped	hat,	and	space	suit,	Pope
the	 Polack	 sets	 off,	 trudging	 through	 the	 desert.	 Cardinal	 Catzass	 waves	 the
incense-burner	as	they	go.
Ten	hours	and	twenty	miles	later,	both	the	Polack	pope	and	Cardinal	Catzass	are
on	their	hands	and	knees,	gasping	for	water.
The	next	morning	sees	the	pair	of	Polacks	pulling	themselves	slowly	through	the
sand.
That	night,	they	reach	the	top	of	a	small	rise	and	look	at	the	hills	in	the	distance.
There,	 in	 flashing	 neon	 lights,	 the	 whole	 hillside	 is	 lit	 up	 with	 God's	 final
message	to	the	universe.
It	reads:	"We	apologize	for	any	inconvenience."
It	is	midnight	in	a	dark	alley	behind	the	Hoochee	Koochee	pub,	and	the	fearless
lawyer,	Harry	Hypojerk	is	wandering	around	drunk.
Suddenly	he	is	approached	by	a	shabby	looking	guy	named	Fred	the	Freak,	who
is	wearing	a	large	black	overcoat,	a	big	hat,	and	sunglasses.
"Hey,"	says	Fred	the	Freak,	"are	you	a	lawyer?"
"Yes,"	slobbers	Harry,	straightening	up	his	tie,	"I	am."
"And,"	says	Fred	the	Freak,	"do	you	handle	criminal	cases?"
"Yes,	I	do,"	replies	Harry,	wobbling	a	bit.
"Would	you	even	help	a	thief?"	asks	Fred	the	Freak.
Harry	blinks	his	eyes,	adjusts	his	coat,	and	says,	"Certainly,	sir."
"Okay,"	says	Fred	the	Freak,	pulling	out	his	gun.	"Then	you	can	start	by	helping
me	with	your	wallet!"
Nivedano...
Nivedano...
Be	silent.
Close	your	eyes,	feel	your	body	to	be	completely	frozen.
Look	inwards,	as	deeply	as	you	can	reach.	At	the	very	end	you	will	find	your	life
source.
This	life	source	is	connected	with	the	universal	life.
To	experience	this	 is	 to	be	a	buddha,	utterly	empty	of	 the	world	but	absolutely
full	of	blissfulness,	of	benediction,	of	gratitude...	of	a	deep	prayer	to	existence,
of	thankfulness.
Look	 as	 closely	 as	 you	 can	 to	 the	 source	 of	 your	 life,	 the	 center	 of	 your
consciousness,	because	you	have	 to	 remember	 it	 later	on	while	you	are	on	 the
circumference	of	life...
doing	all	kinds	of	things,	but	never	for	a	single	moment	losing	touch	with	your
innermost	life	source.
Doing	everything,	but	as	a	buddha.
The	very	awareness	 that	"I	am	the	buddha"	 is	going	 to	change	your	whole	 life
pattern.
To	make	it	more	clear,	Nivedano...
Relax.
Just	watch	the	body,	the	mind.
They	are	not	you,	you	are	the	watcher.	And	the	watcher	is	another	name	for	the
buddha.
This	 is	 a	 blissful	 evening	 --	 ten	 thousand	 people	 just	 drowned	 in	 an	 oceanic
consciousness	of	watchfulness.
Ten	thousand	buddhas	--	there	has	never	been	such	an	assembly.
Be	 very	 careful	 and	 cautious	 that	 you	 don't	 lose	 this	 watchfulness	 when	 you
come	back	from	the	center	to	the	circumference.
Nivedano...
Come	back,	but	come	with	all	the	experience,	full	of	joy,	peace	and	silence.
With	grace	and	gratitude,	sit	down	as	a	buddha	for	a	few	moments.
This	is	going	to	be	your	final	posture;	slowly	slowly,	you	will	be	settled	in	your
buddha	 nature.	And	 if	we	 can	 create	 ten	 thousand	 buddhas,	 that	 is	 enough	 to
save	humanity	--	ten	thousand	buddhas	reaching	to	every	nook	and	corner	of	the
world,	simply	spreading	love,	compassion,	awareness.
And	I	don't	think	that	if	the	world	has	so	many	buddhas,	it	can	be	destroyed	by
criminal	politicians.
This	is	a	crucial	moment,	of	great	responsibility	and	also	of	great	challenge.
It	 is	not	only	a	question	of	your	being	a	buddha,	 it	 is	a	question	of	saving	this
whole	planet	in	its	all	beauty	and	greatness.
In	the	past,	people	used	to	be	buddhas	just	for	their	own	sake.	Today,	times	are
different.
You	have	to	be	a	buddha	not	only	for	your	own	sake,	but	for	the	sake	of	saving
the	whole	world	from	nuclear	weapons	and	the	holders	of	nuclear	weapons.
We	 have	 to	 create	 a	 great	 consciousness	 around	 the	 globe.	 That	 is	 our	 only
protection	against	destructive	science	and	the	criminal	politicians.
Remember:	your	responsibility	is	great,	but	it	has	to	be	a	joy,	not	a	duty.	It	has	to
be	your	 love,	 your	 sharing	of	 blissfulness,	 aliveness,	 your	 songs,	 your	 dances,
your	joy.
I	 am	 not	 telling	 you	 to	 be	 missionaries,	 I	 want	 you	 to	 be	 the	 mission.
Missionaries	 have	 only	 carried	 borrowed	 knowledge.	 I	 want	 you	 to	 be	 the
mission	in	the	sense	that	you	will	be	spreading	your	own	experience.	You	will	be
radiating	your	own	buddhahood.	A	wildfire	has	to	be	created	around	the	globe,
of	consciousness.
This	is	the	only	hope	for	humanity,	the	only	hope	for	the	universe,	to	have	this
small	planet	so	alive,	so	beautiful,	so	lovely.	This	is	for	the	first	 time,	that	you
are	required	to	be	buddhas	not	just	for	you,	but	to	create	an	atmosphere	in	which
a	third	world	war	cannot	happen.
Okay,	Maneesha?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.
Can	we	celebrate	the	ten	thousand	buddhas?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.

OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
A	MONK	 ASKED	 RINZAI,	 "WHAT	 IS	 THE	 ATTITUDE	 OF	 THE	 HEART
WHICH
DOES	NOT	CHANGE	FROM	MOMENT	TO	MOMENT?"
THE	MASTER	 SAID:	 "FROM	 THE	MOMENT	 YOU	 SET	 YOURSELF	 TO
ASK	THIS
QUESTION,	 THERE	 IS	 ALREADY	 THE	 DIFFERENCE,	 AND	 YOUR
ESSENTIAL
NATURE	 AND	 YOUR	 ACTION	 BECOME	 SEPARATE....	 DO	 NOT	 BE
DECEIVED.
IN	AND	OUT	OF	THE	WORLD	THERE	 IS	NOT	A	THING	THAT	HAS	A
SELF-NATURE,	NOR	A	NATURE	THAT	IS	PRODUCTIVE	OF	A	SELF.	ALL
IS	BUT
EMPTY	 NAMES,	 AND	 THE	 VERY	 LETTERS	 OF	 THESE	 NAMES	 ARE
ALSO
EMPTY.
"IF	YOU	TAKE	THESE	EMPTY	NAMES	FOR	REAL,	YOU	MAKE	A	BIG
MISTAKE.	FOR	THOUGH	THEY	EXIST,	THEY	BELONG	IN	THE	REALM
OF
DEPENDENT	CHANGE,	ARE	LIKE	ROBES	TO	PUT	ON	AND	OFF.
"THERE	IS	THE	ROBE	OF	BODHI,	OF	NIRVANA,	OF	DELIVERANCE,	OF
THE
TRIKAYA,	 OF	 OBJECTIVE	 WISDOM,	 OF	 BODHISATTVAS	 AND	 OF
BUDDHA.
"WHAT	 ARE	 YOU	 SEEKING	 IN	 THE	 REALM	 OF	 CHANGING
DEPENDENCE?
THE	 THREE	 VEHICLES	 AND	 THE	 TWELVE	 DIVISIONS	 OF	 THE
TEACHINGS,	 ALL	 ARE	 SO	 MUCH	 OLD	 PAPER	 TO	 MOP	 UP	 MESSES.
THE	BUDDHA	IS	AN
ILLUSORY	PHANTOM.	THE	PATRIARCHS	ARE	OLD	MONKS.	YOU
YOURSELVES,	ARE	YOU	NOT	BORN	OF	A	MOTHER?
"IF	 YOU	 SEEK	 THE	 BUDDHA,	 YOU	 WILL	 BE	 CAUGHT	 BY	 THE
BUDDHA	 DEMON;	 IF	 YOU	 SEEK	 THE	 PATRIARCHS,	 YOU	 WILL	 BE
BOUND	BY	THE
PATRIARCH	DEMON.	WHATEVER	YOU	ARE	SEEKING,	ALL	BECOMES
SUFFERING.	IT	IS	BETTER	TO	HAVE	NOTHING	FURTHER	TO	SEEK."
Maneesha,	 the	 clouds	 and	 the	 rain	 and	 the	 silent	 bamboos,	 and	 ten	 thousand
people	 sitting	 silently,	 is	 a	 rare	 phenomenon.	 This	 kind	 of	 assembly	 has
disappeared	from	the	world.	It	used	to	be,	when	Buddha	was	walking,	or	when
Rinzai	was	alive....	You	are	 representative	of	a	 forgotten	past,	which	 is	not	 the
past	of	the	crowd	but	only	the	past	of	the	awakened	ones.
Rinzai's	statement	is	tremendously	significant,	but	before	I	say	something	about
it,	as	a	preface....
Man's	personality	has	been	divided	 in	concentric	circles.	The	 first	 circle	 is	 the
body.
Within	it,	another	circle	is	the	mind.	Within	that,	another	third	circle	is	the	heart.
And	within	the	third	circle,	the	center	is	the	self.	Buddha	goes	beyond	it.
The	 atheists	 belong	 to	 and	believe	only	 in	 the	 first	 circle.	They	deny	all	 other
circles	as	imagination.	Mind	also	is	a	function	of	the	body.	The	theists	believe	in
all	the	four	circles:	the	body,	the	mind,	the	heart,	and	the	self.	Their	insistence	is
that	 the	 first	 three	 circles	 are	 insignificant	 or	 illusory,	 they	 are	 not	 your	 true
reality.	Your	true	reality	is	the	fourth	center.
Buddha	is	breaking	new	ground.	He	goes	beyond	the	fourth;	he	goes	beyond	the
self.	 No-self,	 anatta,	 is	 your	 true	 existence.	 When	 you	 are	 not,	 you	 are.	 Of
course,	 not	 in	 the	 same	 form	 as	 you	 have	 known	 yourself.	You	 are	 spread	 all
over	the	cosmos.
This	is	something	unique,	for	which	Buddha	fought	for	forty-two	years,	because
every	religion	stops	at	the	self,	the	atma.	Buddha	is	alone	in	the	whole	field,	in
saying	that	unless	you	go	beyond	self,	you	cannot	enter	into	the	universal,	into
the	cosmic.	You	cannot	become	the	rains	and	you	cannot	become	the	bamboos
and	you	cannot	become	the	roses...	Why	remain	contained	in	a	small	bag?	Why
not	be	the	whole?	According	to	Buddha,	to	be	the	whole	is	the	only	holiness.
Rinzai	is	making	his	statement	in	this	context;	and	very	perfectly.
A	MONK	 ASKED	 RINZAI,	 "WHAT	 IS	 THE	 ATTITUDE	 OF	 THE	 HEART
WHICH
DOES	NOT	CHANGE	FROM	MOMENT	TO	MOMENT?"
The	problem	is	perennial.	The	master	says	something	--	of	course	he	has	to	use
words,	 language,	 concepts,	 but	 that	 is	 not	what	 he	wants	 to	 say.	That	 is	 sheer
helplessness,	sheer	poverty	of	language;	nothing	can	be	done	about	it.	We	have
to	use	the	marketplace	language	in	a	world	where	neither	the	body	exists,	nor	the
mind	exists,	nor	the	self	exists,	but	just	a	silence.	How	to	convey	it?	Some	word
has	to	be	used,	some	language,	to	communicate.	And	immediately	the	problem
arises	--	the	disciple	clings	to	the	words.
It	 has	 to	 be	 repeated	 again	 and	 again	 for	 the	 disciple	 that	 the	word	 is	 not	 the
message.	The	word	is	just	a	vehicle	of	an	invisible	message.	That	message	is	not
contained	in	the	word,	it	is	around	the	word.	Don't	cling	to	the	word,	just	see	the
hint.
But	 it	 is	 very	 difficult.	 We	 are	 accustomed	 to	 understand	 language	 by
understanding	 the	 word.	 But	 when	 you	 come	 to	 a	 buddha,	 you	 have	 to
understand	language	in	a	new	way.
You	 have	 to	 understand	 the	 gaps	 between	 the	 words.	 There	 the	 buddha	 is
present.	In	the	words	he	has	to	use	the	mind,	but	when	there	is	a	gap,	 that	gap
shows	his	emptiness,	his	nothingness,	his	beyondness.
A	great	Sufi	mystic	kept	a	holy	book...	Everybody	thought	that	it	must	be	very
mysterious,	because	he	never	allowed	anyone	to	see	within	it,	or	read	it.	He	kept
it	 just	 under	 his	 pillow,	 and	when	 there	was	 nobody	 around,	 he	would	 take	 it
from	 its	 place	 and	 open	 the	 book,	 and	 would	 go	 through	 all	 the	 gestures	 of
reading.
It	 became	 more	 and	 more	 mysterious	 as	 he	 became	 more	 and	 more	 famous.
Perhaps	he	is	keeping	something	secret,	to	be	delivered	only	to	the	chosen	few.
Again	and	again	he	was	asked,	"Why	don't	you	talk	about	the	book?"
He	said,	"I	cannot	talk	about	the	book.	When	I	am	gone,	then	you	can	read	it;	not
while	I'm	here	because	I	cannot	explain	what	is	written	in	the	book.	But	when	I
am	gone	it	is	none	of	my	responsibility.	You	read	it	--	whether	you	understand	it
or	not	is	your	business."
It	became	more	and	more	mysterious.	People	were	trying	in	every	way	to	at	least
have	a	look.	When	everybody	else	was	gone,	somebody	would	be	hiding	on	the
roof,	removing	a	tile	and	looking.	But	the	moment	he	would	remove	the	tile,	the
master	would	close	the	book.
The	moment	he	died	--	he	was	so	much	loved	--	but	the	moment	he	died,	people
were	more	 concerned	 about	 the	 book	 than	 about	 his	 death.	 They	 immediately
took	 out	 the	 book,	 and	 they	 were	 shocked	 and	 surprised:	 the	 book	 contained
nothing!	It	was	an	empty	book.	They	turned	all	the	pages...	somewhere,	perhaps,
the	message.	They	went	on	again	and	again;	perhaps	they	had	missed	the	page
where	the	message	is.	But	there	was	nothing	at	all.
For	 one	 thousand	 years,	 the	 book	 had	 been	 given	 from	 the	 master	 to	 his
successor,	a	disciple.	It	is	very	significant;	it	says,	"Don't	look	at	the	words,	read
the	emptiness."
This	monk	is	asking:
"WHAT	IS	THE	ATTITUDE	OF	THE	HEART	WHICH	DOES	NOT	CHANGE
FROM
MOMENT	TO	MOMENT?"
It	cannot	be	his	own	experience	in	any	case,	because	the	one	who	knows	will	not
ask	 such	 a	 question.	When	 the	 heart	 is	 empty	 it	 has	 no	 attitude.	 If	 it	 has	 an
attitude,	 how	 can	 it	 be	 empty?	When	 the	 heart	 is	 empty,	 this	 question	 cannot
arise:
"WHAT	IS	THE	ATTITUDE	OF	THE	HEART	WHICH	DOES	NOT	CHANGE
FROM
MOMENT	TO	MOMENT?"
THE	MASTER	 SAID,	 "FROM	 THE	MOMENT	 YOU	 SET	 YOURSELF	 TO
ASK	THIS
QUESTION,	THERE	IS	ALREADY	THE	DIFFERENCE..."
He	is	making	him	aware	that	the	moment	you	ask	this	question,	you	have	created
the	difference.	Just	as	the	question	arises	in	you,	your	heart	is	no	longer	empty.
And	 anybody	 who	 gives	 you	 an	 answer	 will	 make	 your	 heart	 again	 full	 of
attitudes,	answers,	questions...	It	will	lose	its	emptiness;	and	that	emptiness	is	its
beauty,	its	purity,	its	grandeur.
Nobody	else	has	understood	the	beauty	of	emptiness,	of	being	nobody,	of	being
just	a	nothing,	a	pure	 silence	where	nothing	moves.	Gautam	Buddha	stands	as
the	highest	peak	of	the	Himalayas.	There	have	been	many	mystics,	but	Gautam
Buddha's	height,	his	purity,	his	clarity,	is	incomparable.
Rinzai	and	others	are	simply	conveying	the	same	experience.	Of	course	they	are
not	so	articulate	as	Gautam	Buddha	himself,	but	everybody	is	trying	his	best	to
satisfy	the	disciple,	the	questioner.
THE	MASTER	 SAID:	 "FROM	 THE	MOMENT	 YOU	 SET	 YOURSELF	 TO
ASK	THIS
QUESTION,	THERE	IS	ALREADY	THE	DIFFERENCE..."
You	are	no	more	 the	same.	The	empty	heart	does	not	ask	anything;	everything
comes	to	it	on	its	own	accord.
You	just	 look	at	 the	rains...	We	have	not	burned	any	woman	on	a	funeral	pyre;
neither	 have	we	 burned	 any	 Shankaracharya.	We	 don't	 indulge	 in	 such	 stupid
ideas,	but	Poona	has	never	known	such	rains	as	it	has	known	this	year.	What	is
the	 reason?	 When	 ten	 thousand	 people	 sit	 silently,	 the	 clouds	 come	 by
themselves.	You	 just	 be	 silent,	 and	 everything	 comes	 simultaneously	 to	you	 --
and	 in	abundance!	Nature	 is	absolutely	 ready	 to	give	up	all	 its	 treasures	 to	 the
empty	heart.
But	 rather	 than	asking	 the	question,	become	 the	empty	heart,	 and	you	will	 see
miracles	happening	around	you	for	which	you	have	not	done	anything.	They	are
sheer	gifts	of	nature	to	the	man	who	has	an	empty	heart.	He	deserves	it,	although
he	does	not	demand	it;	he	is	fulfilled,	although	he	does	not	ask	for	it.
His	 fulfillment	 is	 a	 totally	 different	 phenomenon.	 It	 is	 not	 filled	 with	 any
objective	richness,	fame,	respectability,	or	power.	He	is	filled	with	a	deep	inner
dance,	a	laughter	for	no	reason,	a	joy	just	like	a	small	child.	Just	being	is	itself	a
gift;	a	blissfulness	surrounds	him,	a	great	field	of	silence	and	presence.
And	this	is	for	those	who	are	only	at	the	center.	Buddha	wants	you	to	go	beyond
the	center.
In	Pali,	the	self	is	called	atta,	and	no-self	is	called	anatta.	Buddha	is	the	first	man
in	history	who	has	used	anatta:	no-self	 is	your	 reality,	you	don't	have	any	self.
You	are	just	like	an	onion:	you	go	on	peeling	it,	thinking	that	beyond	this	layer
you	will	find	something.	You	find	another	cover	to	peel	off.	You	go	on	peeling,
and	finally	nothing	is	left	in	your	hands.	That	nothing	is	anatta.
You	are	neither	the	body,	nor	the	mind,	nor	the	heart,	nor	even	the	self.	You	are
just	a	pure	awareness	beyond	all	kinds	of	cages.	But	don't	ask	a	question.	Rather
experience	it,	because	it	is	not	a	question-and-answer	thing.	It	is	not	something
to	be	believed,	it	is	something	to	be	lived.
Rinzai	says,
"The	moment	you	ask,	YOUR	ESSENTIAL	NATURE	AND	YOUR	ACTION
BECOME
SEPARATE....	 DO	 NOT	 BE	 DECEIVED.	 IN	 AND	 OUT	 OF	 THE	WORLD
THERE	IS
NOT	A	THING	THAT	HAS	A	SELF-NATURE..."
He	is	very	clear.	Not	a	single	thing	in	the	whole	world	has	a	self-nature,	because
if	 things	 have	 self-nature,	 then	 they	 will	 never	 be	 able	 to	 merge	 into	 the
universal.	 They	 will	 always	 remain	 separate	 islands;	 tiny,	 imprisoned	 in	 their
own	body-mind-self.
He	is	really	a	man	of	courage	to	say,
"THERE	IS	NOT	A	SINGLE	THING	THAT	HAS	A	SELF-NATURE,	NOR	A
NATURE	 THAT	 IS	 PRODUCTIVE	 OF	 A	 SELF.	 ALL	 IS	 BUT	 EMPTY
NAMES,	AND
THE	VERY	LETTERS	OF	THESE	NAMES	ARE	ALSO	EMPTY.
"IF	YOU	TAKE	THESE	EMPTY	NAMES	FOR	REAL,	YOU	MAKE	A	BIG
MISTAKE.	FOR	THOUGH	THEY	EXIST,	THEY	BELONG	IN	THE	REALM
OF
DEPENDENT	CHANGE,	ARE	LIKE	ROBES	TO	PUT	ON	AND	OFF."
You	have	been	in	many	bodies,	in	many	species.	You	have	changed	your	clothes
many	 times,	 you	have	 changed	your	 residence	many	 times;	 you	have	 changed
your	address	and	name	many	times.	It	has	been	for	centuries	that	in	sannyas	you
are	given	a	new	name.	It	is	indicative:	you	consciously	change	the	name	so	that
you	know	it	is	just	a	fiction.	The	old	name	had	become	a	great	reality;	the	new
name	 is	 not	 yet	 conditioned.	 It	 is	 symbolic,	 that	 everything	 in	 you	 is
continuously	 changing,	 eternally.	 Even	 your	 self	 is	 not	 the	 same,	 it	 goes	 on
changing.	Then	what	remains?
Rinzai	is	very	straightforward.	He	says,	"THERE	IS	THE	ROBE	OF	BODHI,"	--
even	 enlightenment	 is	 a	 robe,	 don't	 get	 identified	with	 it	 --	 "THERE	 IS	 THE
ROBE	OF
BODHI,	OF	NIRVANA,	OF	DELIVERANCE,	OF	THE	TRIKAYA	--	the	three
bodies	we	have	talked	about.	But	these	are	all	changing	layers;	nothing	of	them
is	 to	 be	 made	 a	 permanent	 home.	 "...	 OF	 OBJECTIVE	 WISDOM,	 OF
BODHISATTVAS	AND	OF
BUDDHA."	Even	if	you	think	you	are	a	buddha,	don't	get	identified	with	it,	it	is
just	a	passing	phase.	It	is	just	a	bridge	to	nothingness.	The	most	perfect	bridge,
of	course,	but	still	a	bridge.
"WHAT	 ARE	 YOU	 SEEKING	 IN	 THE	 REALM	 OF	 CHANGING
DEPENDENCE?"
Where	 everything	 is	 changing,	 what	 are	 you	 seeking?	 Even	 the	 seeker	 is
changing	while	you	are	seeking.	Stop	seeking,	stop	searching,	just	be.	And	you
will	be	surprised:	the	last	stop	is	the	self.	It	 is	a	kind	of	feeling	of	am-ness,	is-
ness	--	but	it	too	is	just	a	last	stop,	not	yet	a	home.	One	step	more,	from	self	to
no-self.	 Just	disappear	without	any	condition,	as	a	perfume	disappears	 into	 the
air.
Gautam	Buddha's	contribution	is	certainly	the	greatest	that	any	man	has	made	to
humanity.
"WHAT	 ARE	 YOU	 SEEKING	 IN	 THE	 REALM	 OF	 CHANGING
DEPENDENCE?
THE	 THREE	 VEHICLES	 AND	 THE	 TWELVE	 DIVISIONS	 OF	 THE
TEACHINGS,	 ALL	 ARE	 SO	 MUCH	 OLD	 PAPER	 TO	 MOP	 UP	 MESSES.
THE	BUDDHA	IS	AN
ILLUSORY	PHANTOM."
Other	religions	would	be	very	much	disturbed.	No	Christian	can	say	that	Jesus
Christ	 is	 a	 phantom;	 no	Hindu	 can	 say	 that	Krishna	 is	 a	 phantom.	This	much
courage	 has	 been	 shown	 only	 by	 Zen	 masters.	 It	 is	 not	 that	 they	 don't	 love
Buddha	--	they	love	him,	they	worship	him	--	but	truth	is	truth.	The	Buddha	of
your	conceptions	is	an	illusory	phantom.
You	have	to	go	beyond	it.	You	have	to	be	simply	nothing.
"THE	 PATRIARCHS	ARE	OLD	MONKS.	YOU	YOURSELVES,	ARE	YOU
NOT
BORN	OF	A	MOTHER?"
If	you	are	born	of	a	mother,	then	you	are	bound	to	die	sooner	or	later.	Every	birth
makes	it	certain	that	you	are	going	to	die.	Everything	is	so	illusory;	what	are	you
seeking?
This	is	a	totally	different	approach	from	that	of	any	other	religion.	They	all	tell
you	 to	 seek	and	 search.	But	Rinzai	 is	 saying,	 "Stop	all	 seeking	and	 searching,
and	 just	 be."	And	 look	deeply	 into	 your	 being,	 and	 even	your	 being	will	 start
melting	 like	 ice	 in	 June.	 Not	 even	 a	 trace	 will	 be	 left	 of	 you.	 You	 will	 have
merged	into	the	totality	of	existence.
On	 the	surface	 it	 is	 frightening;	 that's	why	Zen	could	not	become	a	worldwide
phenomenon.	If	you	tell	a	person	"I	can	teach	you	how	to	be	poor,"	he	will	say,
"Get	lost!
I	am	already	poor."
But	if	somebody	says,	"I	can	teach	you	how	to	be	rich,"	then	certainly	you	will
respect	 the	man	 and	 will	 listen	 to	 his	 wisdom.	 There	 are	 thousands	 of	 books
around	the	world,	telling	people	how	to	be	successful,	how	to	be	rich.	I	have	not
seen	a	single	book	which	says	how	to	be	poor,	how	to	be	a	failure.
And	Buddha	was	 teaching	 how	 to	 be	 nothing!	 People	 have	 asked	 him,	 "What
kind	of	teaching	is	this?	At	least	right	now	we	are.	We	may	be	in	misery,	we	may
be	in	trouble,	but	at	least	we	are.	Teach	us	how	not	to	be	in	trouble,	how	not	to
be	miserable....	Rather	than	that	you	teach	us	just	to	disappear!"
But	Buddha	knows	better.	He	knows	that	as	long	as	you	are,	you	are	going	to	be
in	misery,	you	are	going	to	be	in	trouble.	The	very	separation	from	the	cosmos	is
the	source	of	all	your	miseries.	It	may	take	different	forms,	but	the	real	form,	the
reality,	is	that	you	have	taken	yourself	apart	from	this	vast	existence.
So	Buddha	said,	"I	am	trying	so	that	you	will	not	have	any	trouble,	any	misery.
Just	be	nothing;	then	how	can	you	be	troubled?	Who	will	be	troubled?"
He	has	found	one	of	the	greatest	truths	ever	found:	that	you	and	your	misery	are
not	two	things.	You	are	the	misery,	you	are	the	problem.	Your	mind	tells	you	that
this	is	not	so:
"We	can	change	the	misery."	That	is	true....	The	misery	you	can	change,	but	you
will	change	it	for	another	misery.	You	can	go	on	changing	--	everybody	is	doing
that	--	from	one	misery	to	another	misery.	But	you	never	come	to	realize	that	the
real	misery	is	that	you	are.	You	are	separate	from	existence.
Buddha	is	hard,	but	absolutely	true:	until	you	dissolve	yourself	into	the	totality,
you	will	be	troubled.	The	very	separation	is	the	cause	of	your	hell.
"IF	 YOU	 SEEK	 THE	 BUDDHA,	 YOU	 WILL	 BE	 CAUGHT	 BY	 THE
BUDDHA	DEMON..."	 These	Zen	masters	 have	 a	 courage	 totally	 unknown	 to
any	other	religion.
"IF	 YOU	 SEEK	 THE	 BUDDHA,	 YOU	 WILL	 BE	 CAUGHT	 BY	 THE
BUDDHA	 DEMON;	 IF	 YOU	 SEEK	 THE	 PATRIARCHS,	 YOU	 WILL	 BE
BOUND	BY	THE
PATRIARCH	DEMON.	WHATEVER	YOU	ARE	SEEKING,	ALL	BECOMES
SUFFERING."
Seeking,	in	short,	is	the	source	of	suffering.
Do	not	seek,	just	be.
Don't	go	anywhere,	just	remain	at	your	center.	A	small	movement,	and	you	have
missed	 the	 point.	 And	 this	 center	 of	 your	 being	 is	 just	 the	 center	 of	 a	 soap
bubble.	But	 to	reach	to	 the	center	 is	 to	have	at	 least	reached	to	the	door	of	 the
temple.
Now	don't	be	afraid,	and	enter	the	door	of	nothingness,	of	no-selfness,	of	anatta.
Let	your	whole	being	be	filled	with	the	sense	that	"I	am	not;	existence	is."
To	 understand	 Gautam	 Buddha,	 or	 his	 disciples	 who	 have	 attained	 to	 this
nothingness,	 is	absolutely	 impossible	with	 the	mind.	Mind	will	always	want	 to
be.	 The	mind	 will	 always	 think,	 "What	 a	 strange	 teaching,	 to	 make	 so	 much
arduous	 effort	 not	 to	 be.	 With	 this	 much	 effort,	 you	 could	 have	 become	 the
richest	man	in	the	world.	With	so	much	effort,	you	could	have	become	a	prime
minister,	a	president.	And	this	strange	fellow	has	himself	dropped	his	kingdom,
and	is	now	teaching	people	how	to	be	nothing."
I	don't	think...	if	somebody	writes	a	book,	like	Dale	Carnegie	--	Dale	Carnegie's
book	has	sold	second	only	 to	 the	Holy	Bible.	HOW	TO	WIN	FRIENDS	AND
INFLUENCE
PEOPLE	is	the	title	of	his	book.	And	he	has	certainly	made	many	friends	--	there
are	Dale	Carnegie	Clubs	all	around	the	world,	where	his	book	is	read.	They	run
classes,	 and	 schools,	 and	 courses.	 Looking	 at	 his	 book,	 you	 will	 see:	 he	 is
creating	a	science	of	hypocrisy.	Whether	you	want	 to	smile	or	not,	you	should
smile	--	even	at	a	stranger,	because	one	never	knows,	tomorrow	you	may	need
him.
I	have	been	doing	just	the	opposite:	how	to	influence	people,	and	increase	your
enemies!
And	I	think	I	am	more	successful	than	Dale	Carnegie.
Zen	could	not	become	a	worldwide	experience	for	the	simple	reason	that	nobody
is	ready	for	that	great	explosion	in	which	you	are	lost.	But	think	for	a	moment:
what	are	you?
What	are	you	going	to	preserve?	And	what	is	the	point,	what	will	you	do	with	it?
Even	if	you	discover	your	self,	then	what	are	you	going	to	do	with	it?
You	 will	 create	 new	 miseries,	 new	 troubles,	 new	 engagements,	 new
appointments,	new	love	affairs	...	because	you	cannot	just	be.	Otherwise	you	will
start	thinking	to	yourself,
"Have	I	gone	mad?"	No	girlfriend,	no	boyfriend,	just	sitting	in	your	room,	being
nobody...	 You	will	 jump	 out	 of	 your	 room,	 take	 your	 rented	 bicycle,	 and	 run
away	to	find	someone!	You	know	that	there	will	be	troubles,	but	it	 is	better:	at
least	 those	 troubles	keep	you	alive.	Just	a	good	fight	 in	 the	pub,	coming	home
drunk,	staggering,	but	at	least	you	are.
But	what	is	the	point?
Zen's	 experience	 is	 that	 unless	 you	 go	 beyond	 self	 and	 start	 enjoying	 being
nobody;	 unless	 nothingness	 becomes	 your	 blissfulness,	 you	 have	missed	 your
life	completely.	It	is	the	greatest	challenge	that	can	be	given	to	any	human	being.
And	only	those	who	have	the	lion's	heart	have	followed	the	path	of	Zen	--	even
in	China,	just	a	small	stream;	in	Japan	a	very	small	stream.
When	I	was	arrested	in	America,	 the	first	 telegram	came	from	a	Zen	master	 in
Japan,	to	Ronald	Reagan,	with	a	copy	to	me.	It	said,	"You	are	doing	the	worst,
most	stupid	thing	that	one	can	conceive	of."	The	jailer	came	running	to	me	and
he	said,	"Who	is	this	man?"
I	said,	"I	don't	know,	but	certainly	he	is	a	man	of	understanding."
The	 jailer	 said,	 "He	 may	 be	 a	 man	 of	 understanding,	 but	 he	 does	 not	 know
manners	--
calling	the	president	stupid!"
I	said,	"You	don't	know	about	Zen!	When	somebody	is	stupid,	they	call	it	stupid.
You	can	inform	the	president	that	I	agree	with	the	Zen	master."
Zen	has	been	a	path	of	the	very	few	chosen	ones	who	have	guts	enough	even	to
disappear.
"WHATEVER	 YOU	 ARE	 SEEKING,"	 says	 Rinzai,	 "ALL	 BECOMES
SUFFERING."
Western	psychology	has	not	come	to	 this	understanding.	We	try	to	help	people
out	of	one	suffering,	and	another	is	coming	on.	Nobody	except	Zen	has	come	to
the	realization	that	every	seeking	becomes	suffering.	It	does	not	matter	what	you
are	 seeking	 --	money,	power,	 richness,	 fame,	or	 even	 if	 you	are	 trying	 to	be	 a
buddha	--	you	are	creating	suffering	for	yourself.
"IT	IS	BETTER	TO	HAVE	NOTHING	FURTHER	TO	SEEK."
Just	stop!	So	when	I	say	during	your	meditations...	I	am	not	saying	that	you	have
to	become	a	buddha.	That	will	become	a	seeking,	and	a	suffering.	I	am	saying
you	 are	 a	 buddha;	 just	 recognize	 it,	 and	 there	 ends	 the	 matter.	 Once	 you
recognize	you	are	the	buddha	you	will	melt,	when	the	time	and	season	is	right,
into	the	ultimate	reality.	To	be	the	buddha	is	only	the	beginning	of	the	end;	but
what	 a	 beautiful	 beginning,	 and	 what	 a	 beautiful	 end.	 Without	 any	 struggle,
allowing	existence	to	take	over,	is	the	greatest	ecstasy	in	the	world.
Rinzai	has	made	a	very	strong	and	honest	statement.	I	hope	it	will	be	helpful	to
all	 of	 you	 who	 are	 on	 the	 path	 of	 meditation.	 Remember,	 this	 is	 the	 path	 of
disappearing.
A	haiku	by	Uko:
CUCKOO,
TAKE	ME	UP	TO	WHERE
CLOUDS	DRIFT.
He	is	saying	the	same	thing:	TAKE	ME	UP	TO	WHERE	CLOUDS	DRIFT,	into
the	universal,	into	the	sky;	I	don't	want	to	remain	confined	in	the	body,	the	mind,
the	heart,	and	the	self.	Just	take	me	away	from	all	these.
This	is	what	Gautam	Buddha	calls	freedom.	Less	than	that	is	a	compromise.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
I	THINK	I	HEARD	YOU	SAY	RECENTLY	THAT	WHEN	WE	ARE	AWARE
OF
OUR	EMPTINESS,	WHEN	WE	ARE	CONSCIOUS	--	EVEN	IF	IT	IS	ONLY
FOR	AN
INSTANT	--	WE	ARE	IN	THE	SAME	STATE	THAT	YOU	ARE	ALWAYS	IN.
BUT,	ISN'T	IT	THAT	YOUR	STATE	OF	CONSCIOUSNESS	IS	NOT	JUST
QUANTITATIVELY	DIFFERENT	FROM	OURS	--	IN	THAT	YOU	ARE
CONSCIOUS	TWENTY-FOUR	HOURS	A	DAY	--	BUT	IS	QUALITATIVELY
DIFFERENT?
I	LOVE	YOU	AND	I	LOVE	THAT	SPACE	OF	EMPTINESS	THAT	I	FEEL.
WHY
THEN	THIS	RELUCTANCE	TO	ACCEPT	THAT	MY	EMPTINESS	 IS	THE
SAME
AS	YOURS?
Maneesha,	 it	 is	 an	 ancient	 question,	whether	 there	 is	 any	 relationship	between
quantity	and	quality,	or	no	relationship.	Science	has	finally	decided	on	the	fact
that	they	are	interchangeable.
In	a	very	ordinary	experiment,	you	can	boil	water	to	ninety-nine	degrees;	it	will
not	 evaporate.	 The	 moment	 it	 comes	 to	 a	 hundred	 degrees,	 it	 will	 evaporate.
Now	certainly,	the	evaporated	water	and	the	liquid	water,	although	they	are	both
water,	have	a	qualitative	difference.
On	 the	 other	 hand,	 if	 you	 go	 on	 lowering	 the	 temperature	 the	water	 becomes
solid	ice.
Ice,	water,	vapor	--	the	inner	thing	is	the	same,	but	their	outer	expression	is	not
only	 quantitatively	 different,	 it	 is	 qualitatively	 different.	 For	 example,	 you
cannot	quench	your	 thirst	with	vapor.	 In	 the	first	place,	 to	catch	hold	of	 it	 in	a
glass	 is	going	 to	be	a	difficult	 task;	and	even	 if	you	catch	hold	of	 it,	 it	 is	now
nothing	but	H2O.	It	has	disintegrated	into	its	basic	elements.
Do	 you	 think	 that,	 by	 repeating	 `H2O',	 like	 a	 transcendental	meditation,	 your
thirst	will	be	quenched?	You	simply	need	water.	H2O,	the	mantra,	will	not	do.
I	 can	 understand	 your	 reluctance	 to	 accept	 it.	 It	 is	 because	 of	 your	 love.	 The
more	you	love	me,	 the	more	you	will	see	 the	heights	of	my	consciousness	and
the	more	you	will	 see	 the	depths	of	your	consciousness.	Your	 love	 is	going	 to
reveal	the	dark	valleys	of	your	being,	and	the	sunlit	peaks	of	my	consciousness.
And	because	you	love	me,	you	cannot	simply	shut	your	eyes	and	deny	that	there
are	 any	 sunlit	 peaks.	Your	 love	will	 grow	more,	 to	 the	 point	 that	 you	 have	 to
travel	the	path	from	your	valleys	to	the	sunlit	peaks	of	the	mountain.
The	 only	 thread	 between	 the	master	 and	 the	 disciple	 is	 that	 of	 love.	 It	 is	 not
belief,	it	is	not	faith,	it	is	pure	and	simple	love.	You	have	seen	in	the	master	your
own	ultimate	 realization;	you	have	 seen	 in	 the	master	what	you	can	be.	 Just	 a
little	turning	in,	and	you	will	be	the	same.
And	 your	 reluctance	 is	 natural.	You	 have	 loved	me;	 you	would	 not	 like	 to	 be
equal	 to	me,	 that	seems	to	be	 insulting.	But	 it	 is	not	 insulting,	 it	only	 logically
looks	insulting.	Your	love	turns	into	a	deep	gratitude.
I	 will	 tell	 you	 about	 Sariputta,	 a	 famous	 philosopher	 at	 the	 time	 of	 Gautam
Buddha.	He	became	a	disciple	of	Gautam	Buddha	just	by	seeing	him.	He	himself
had	thousands	of	followers,	but	the	moment	he	saw	Buddha,	he	told	his	disciples
that	now	they	were	free:
"If	you	want	 to	remain	with	me,	you	can,	but	now	I	am	in	a	strange	love	with
this	man."
And	he	became	enlightened	within	two	years.	The	day	he	became	enlightened,
his	eyes	were	full	of	tears,	and	he	was	holding	Buddha's	feet.	Buddha	said,	"Why
are	you	crying?"
He	said,	"I	cannot	accept	that	I	am	equal	to	you.	It	is	just	impossible	for	me	to
think	that	now	there	is	no	difference	between	my	consciousness	and	yours."
Buddha	said,	"Sariputta,	come	to	your	senses!	It	is	my	whole	effort	to	bring	you
to	the	same	consciousness,	to	the	same	height,	as	I	am.	Don't	be	worried	about
the	fact	that	you	have	become	an	equal.	You	have	always	been	an	equal;	it's	just
that	you	never	realized	it.
Your	gratitude	is	enough,	but	don't	feel	reluctant	to	accept	your	buddhahood."
This	is	going	to	happen	to	many	of	you.	But	don't	be	reluctant.	Your	mind	will
say,	 "You	 can	 rise	 as	 much	 as	 possible,	 but	 don't	 rise	 to	 the	 height	 of	 your
master."
There	are	teachers	in	the	world,	fakes,	frauds,	who	would	not	like	you	to	rise	to
their	heights	--	if	they	have	any.	The	authentic	master	is	insistent	that	you	should
become	the	same,	you	should	dwell	on	the	same	heights.	That	is,	 in	a	way,	the
definition	 of	 an	 authentic	master.	 For	 him,	 you	 are	 already	 the	 same,	 you	 just
don't	recognize	it.	The	whole	effort	is	to	bring	the	recognition	to	you.
The	 rains	 have	 come	 to	 listen	 to	 your	 laughter.	 Poor	 rains,	 nobody	 laughs	 at
them.
Nobody	even	says	hello;	on	the	contrary	--	people	are	carrying	umbrellas.	That	is
just	insulting.
Pope	 the	Polack	 is	 invited	 to	 the	White	House	 to	give	a	 special	 speech	on	 the
role	of	the	Vatican	in	saving	the	world.	As	he	is	speaking	to	a	group	of	people	on
the	lawn,	he	coughs,	and	his	false	teeth	fall	out	onto	the	ground	and	break.
Seeing	 the	 situation,	 a	nearby	guest	digs	 into	his	pocket	 and	pulls	out	 a	 set	of
dentures.
Embarrassed,	the	pope	fumbles	around	with	them,	but	because	they	are	too	big,
he	cannot	get	the	teeth	into	his	mouth.
Then	the	guest	reaches	into	another	pocket	and	offers	another	set	of	false	teeth.
But	this	time	they	are	too	small.
The	guest	 pulls	 out	 a	 third	 set	 from	his	 back	pocket,	 and	 the	 toothless	Polack
shoves	them	into	his	mouth.	These	teeth	fit.
Nervous,	but	happy,	Pope	the	Polack	turns	to	the	guest	and	says,	"Wow!	That	is
great.
Are	you	a	dentist?"
"Nope,"	replies	the	guest,	with	a	wink,	"I	am	an	undertaker!"
It	will	 take	a	 little	 time	 for	you	 to	get	 it.	But	 in	 the	middle	of	 the	night,	 don't
forget	to	get	it!
Father	 Fumble,	 the	 newly	 ordained	 priest,	 goes	 for	 some	 practical	 Catholic
experience	with	his	teacher,	Father	Fungus.
The	 two	 priests	 sit	 together	 inside	 the	 confessional	 box	 of	 the	Sacred	Virgin's
Chapel,	and	listen	to	all	the	crimes	against	God	Almighty.
"I	 have	 fornicated	with	 two	 strange	men	 this	 week,"	 confesses	 Katie.	 "Please
forgive	me,	Father."
"You	are	forgiven,	my	child,"	says	Father	Fungus.	"Just	put	forty	dollars	in	the
money	box	and	say	ten	Hail	Marys."
"I	have	been	adulterous	with	my	neighbor,"	pleads	Polly,	the	next	sinner.
"You	are	forgiven,	my	daughter,"	says	Father	Fungus.	"Twenty	dollars	in	the	box
and	ten	Ave	Marias."
"So,"	says	Fungus	to	Father	Fumble.	"Do	you	get	it?	All	the	rates	are	written	in
this	little	book,	and	if	you	have	any	problems,	I	will	be	upstairs."
Father	Fumble	sits	alone	in	the	confessional,	and	in	comes	the	next	customer.
"Father,"	confesses	Betty,	"I	have	just	given	my	boyfriend	Boris	a	blowjob."
"Blowjob?"	says	Father	Fumble,	thumbing	through	his	book.	"Blowjob?"
Then	he	shouts	upstairs,	"Hey,	Father	Fungus!	What	do	I	do	for	a	blowjob?"
"Tell	her	to	put	ten	dollars	in	the	box,"	calls	back	Father	Fungus,	"and	send	her
up	here!"
This	you	get	perfectly	well!
Swami	Deva	Coconut	manages	 to	get	 a	 job	on	Nancy	Reagan's	personal	 staff.
One	day,	he	overhears	Nancy	complaining	to	Ed	Meese	that	she	and	Ronnie	are
having	a	lot	of	trouble	with	their	love	life.
At	a	suitable	moment,	Swami	Coconut	takes	Nancy	aside	and	suggests	that	she
should	 try	mounting	on	 top	of	her	husband,	 instead	of	 lying	underneath	 in	 the
traditional	missionary	position.
Nancy's	 Fundamentalist	 Christian	 morals	 are	 rather	 shocked,	 but	 she	 is	 so
desperate	that	she	agrees	to	give	it	a	go.
The	next	morning,	a	delighted	Nancy	meets	Coconut	in	the	library.
"It	was	like	magic,"	gushes	Nancy,	breathlessly.	"It	was	wonderful.	But	tell	me,
Mr.
Coconut,	 how	 did	 you	 know	 a	 simple	 thing	 like	 that	 would	 make	 all	 the
difference?"
"Easy,"	 replies	 Coconut.	 "Everyone	 knows	 that	 Ronald	 Reagan	 can	 only	 fuck
up!"
Nivedano...
Nivedano...
Be	silent.
Feel	your	whole	body	to	be	frozen.
Close	your	eyes.
This	beautiful	evening,	this	great	rain,	this	tremendous	silence,	will	be	of	help	to
you	to	go	inwards	as	deeply	as	possible.
Go	in...
Deeper	and	deeper.
You	have	to	cross	all	the	lines	I	told	you	about...	the	body,	the	mind,	the	heart.
Reach	to	the	self,	the	center;	and	then	you	can	take	a	jump	into	eternity,	into	the
ultimate	cosmos.
Then	you	can	open	your	wings,	and	fly	in	the	sky.
The	whole	 effort	 of	meditation	 is	 to	 give	 you	 a	 taste	 of	 ultimate	 freedom.	 So
don't	be	afraid	of	anything	--	there	is	nothing	to	be	afraid	of.
It	is	your	own	sky,	it	is	your	own	truth,	it	is	your	own	originality.
This	is	the	buddha	in	you.	Recognize,	remember	--	and	remember	to	remember
afterwards.
To	be	a	buddha	is	just	a	remembrance,	it	is	not	an	achievement.
You	are	already	it.
To	make	it	clear,	Nivedano...
Relax,	let	go.
The	body	will	be	dying,	see	it	as	a	corpse;	with	it	the	mind	will	be	gone.
Just	a	watcher	remains	eternally	with	you.
It	is	your	essential	nature,	but	the	watcher	is	not	the	self.
The	watcher	is	a	no-self,	it	is	nothingness.
It	is	the	empty	heart,	it	is	an	opening	into	the	universe.
Let	 the	experience	sink	deep	 in	every	fibre	of	your	being,	because	 it	has	 to	be
your	very	 life	style.	 In	your	actions	 it	has	 to	be	present.	Around	the	clock	you
have	to	carry	a	remembrance	of	your	being	a	buddha,	and	this	will	transform	all
your	actions	and	responses.
This	is	the	miracle...	because	we	don't	cultivate	any	morality,	we	simply	awaken
your	 buddha.	 And	 all	 morality,	 all	 truth,	 all	 sincerity,	 and	 all	 honesty	 simply
follow	your	remembrance	of	the	buddha,	as	a	shadow.
Nivedano...
Come	back,	but	come	back	as	buddhas,	without	any	hesitation.	Bring	out	with
you	the	experience	of	the	innermost	core.
Sit	 down	 for	 a	 few	moments,	 without	 any	 reluctance,	 as	 a	 buddha.	 It	 is	 your
right,	your	birthright.	It	is	nothing	like	an	achievement,	it	is	just	remembering	a
forgotten	language.
You	are	a	buddha	whether	you	know	or	not.	It	is	better	to	know	it,	because	then
it	transforms	your	whole	life,	brings	new	joys	and	new	flowers,	new	blessings,
new	understandings,	new	clarities	and	perceptions.	It	is	a	total	change.
Morality	has	 to	be	cultivated;	 it	 is	 false.	But	 to	 remember	one's	buddhahood...
the	morality	comes	as	a	shadow,	on	its	own.	Then	it	has	a	beauty,	a	tremendous
grace;	then	you	are	not	doing	it,	it	is	simply	happening.
To	 enter	 into	 the	world	 of	 spontaneity	 and	happenings	 is	 the	 only	 reason	why
you	are	here.	We	are	not	searching	or	seeking	anything.	We	are	simply	trying	to
remember	who	we	are,	what	it	is	that	is	the	center	of	our	life.	Finding	the	center,
it	will	not	be	long	before	suddenly	you	will	realize:	this	center	is	also	the	center
of	the	whole	existence	--
we	are	all	connected	in	the	roots.
And	 the	 experience	 of	 being	 one	 with	 existence	 is	 the	 greatest	 and	 the	 most
valuable	experience	that	is	possible	for	consciousness.
You	are	getting	ready	to	face	a	miracle:	inch	by	inch,	you	are	moving	closer	and
closer	to	the	cliff,	which	I	call	the	center.	One	step	more,	beyond	it,	and	you	will
know	 that	you	were	never	 separate	 from	existence;	you	have	never	been	born,
and	you	have	never	died	-
-	you	are	an	eternity.
The	joy	that	it	brings,	and	the	ecstasy	that	it	brings,	and	the	dance	that	it	brings...
it	makes	your	whole	life	a	celebration.
Okay,	Maneesha?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.
Can	we	celebrate	the	ten	thousand	buddhas?
Yes,	Beloved	Master!

OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
DAIO	SAID	TO	GENCHU:
SINCE	ANCIENT	TIMES,	THE	ENLIGHTENED	ANCESTORS	APPEARING
IN	THE
WORLD	RELIED	 JUST	ON	THEIR	OWN	FUNDAMENTAL	EXPERIENCE
TO
REVEAL	 SOMETHING	 OF	 WHAT	 IS	 BEFORE	 US:	 SO	 WE	 SEE	 THEM
KNOCKING
CHAIRS	 AND	 RAISING	 WHISKS,	 HITTING	 THE	 GROUND	 AND
BRANDISHING
STICKS,	BEATING	A	DRUM	OR	ROLLING	BALLS...
DAIO	CONTINUED:
EVEN	 THOUGH	 THIS	 IS	 SO,	 EMINENT	 GENCHU,	 YOU	 HAVE
TRAVELED	ALL
OVER	AND	 SPENT	A	 LONG	 TIME	 IN	MONASTERIES.	 DON'T	WORRY
ABOUT
SUCH	OLD	CALENDAR	DAYS	AS	THESE	I	MENTIONED	--	JUST	GO	BY
THE
LIVING	ROAD	YOU	SEE	ON	YOUR	OWN;	GOING	EAST,	GOING	WEST,
LIKE	A	HAWK	SAILING	THROUGH	THE	SKIES.	 IN	THE	BLINK	OF	AN
EYE	YOU
CROSS	OVER	TO	THE	OTHER	SIDE.
ON	ANOTHER	OCCASION	DAIO	SAID	TO	KUSHO:
THE	CAUSE	AND	CONDITIONS	OF	THE	ONE	GREAT	CONCERN	OF	THE
ENLIGHTENED	 ONES	 IS	 NOT	 APART	 FROM	 YOUR	 DAILY	 AFFAIRS.
THERE	IS
NO	 DIFFERENCE	 BETWEEN	 HERE	 AND	 THERE.	 IT	 PERVADES	 PAST
AND
PRESENT,	 SHINING	 THROUGH	 THE	 HEAVENS,	 MIRRORING	 THE
EARTH.
THAT	 IS	WHY	 IT	 IS	SAID	THAT	EVERYTHING	 IN	THE	LAST	MYRIAD
EONS	IS
RIGHT	IN	THE	PRESENT.
WE	 VALUE	 THE	 GREAT	 SPIRIT	 OF	 A	 HERO	 ONLY	 IN	 THOSE
CONCERNED.
BEFORE	 ANY	 SIGNS	 BECOME	 DISTINCT,	 BEFORE	 ANY
ILLUSTRATION	IS
EVIDENT,	 CONCENTRATE	 FIERCELY,	 LOOKING,	 LOOKING,	 COMING
OR
GOING,	TILL	YOUR	EFFORT	IS	COMPLETELY	RIPE.
IN	THE	MOMENT	OF	A	THOUGHT,	YOU	ATTAIN	UNION.	THE	MIND	OF
BIRTH
AND	 DEATH	 IS	 DESTROYED	 AND	 SUDDENLY	 YOU	 CLEARLY	 SEE
YOUR
ORIGINAL	APPEARANCE,	THE	SCENE	OF	YOUR	NATIVE	LAND;	EACH
PARTICULAR	DISTINCTLY	CLEAR.	 YOU	 THEN	 SEE	AND	HEAR	 JUST
AS	THE
BUDDHAS	DID,	KNOW	AND	ACT	AS	THE	ENLIGHTENED	ANCESTORS
DID.
Maneesha,	 one	who	 is	 interested	 in	 knowing	who	he	 is	 has	 two	ways	open	 to
him.	 One	 is	 the	 way	 of	 knowledge:	 reading	 scriptures,	 studying	 old	 scholars,
collecting	as	many	concepts	about	one's	being	as	possible.	That	 is	 the	cheaper
way.	There	would	be	nothing	wrong	 if	 it	were	only	 that	 it	 is	 cheaper,	but	 it	 is
wrong,	too.
The	 second	 way	 is	 not	 to	 bother	 about	 others.	 Howsoever	 valuable	 those
scriptures	 may	 be,	 they	 cannot	 give	 you	 even	 a	 single	 glimpse	 of	 your
fundamental	nature.	A	thousand	buddhas	together	cannot	force	you	to	become	a
buddha.
It	is	your	essential	right	to	know	your	fundamental	nature	or	not	to	know	it.	You
cannot	be	 forced	by	 teachers,	by	parents.	Yes,	 they	can	 force	knowledge	upon
you,	 they	 can	 force	 ideologies	 upon	 you.	 They	 do	 force	 religion,	 without
understanding	 that	 if	 you	 are	 full	 of	 ideologies	 you	 become	 almost	 crippled,
prevented	from	knowing	your	own	nature.
You	 are	 so	 burdened	 with	 borrowed	 knowledge	 that	 you	 cannot	 travel	 to	 the
higher	 mountains.	 You	 have	 to	 drop	 all	 your	 weight.	 As	 you	 go	 high	 even
breathing	becomes	difficult;	even	to	have	your	clothes	on	becomes	difficult.	You
have	to	drop	all	weight,	you	have	to	become	weightless.
What	is	true	in	mountaineering	is	also	true	in	the	inner	world	of	consciousness.
If	 you	 want	 to	 go	 in	 you	 will	 have	 to	 cut	 through,	 in	 a	 single	 blow,	 all	 the
knowledge	that	has	been	given	to	you.	Just	burn	it!	It	is	better	to	be	ignorant	on
the	path	--	because	at	least	ignorance	is	innocence	--	than	to	be	knowledgeable.
Knowledgeability	is	 the	greatest	hindrance	to	knowing,	because	you	think	as	if
you	already	know.	But	there	is	no	às	if'	in	existence.	Either	you	know	it	or	you
don't	know	it.
And	 there	 is	 no	 way	 of	 communicating	 it	 through	 words;	 all	 words	 will	 be
misunderstood.	 Only	 the	 presence	 of	 a	 living	 master,	 a	 wordless	 silence,	 can
perhaps	become	a	glimpse,	a	triggering	point	in	you.	It	is	not	being	done	by	the
master;	it	happens	in	your	receptivity,	in	your	openness.	Something	clicks.	There
is	no	other	word	to	replace	the	word	`click'.
Daio	is	saying	to	Genchu:
SINCE	ANCIENT	TIMES,	THE	ENLIGHTENED	ANCESTORS	APPEARING
IN	THE
WORLD	RELIED	 JUST	ON	THEIR	OWN	FUNDAMENTAL	EXPERIENCE
TO
REVEAL	SOMETHING	OF	WHAT	IS	BEFORE	US...
Those	who	have	known	--	 their	difficulty	 is	 that	of	communication.	You	know
the	 taste	 of	 salt	 but	 you	 cannot	 convey	 it	 through	 language.	 Language	 has
limitations,	 and	 the	experience	of	your	 fundamental	nature	 is	of	 the	unlimited.
To	 bring	 the	 unlimited	 to	 the	 limitations	 of	 language	 is	 a	 tremendously	 risky
task.	Even	 though	 it	 is	 done	with	 absolute	 accuracy,	 it	 is	 going	 to	 fail.	Seeing
this,	 the	ancient	masters	have	not	 relied	on	 scriptures,	have	not	even	 relied	on
language.	 They	 are	 their	 own	 authority;	 it	 does	 not	 matter	 whether	 all	 the
scriptures	of	the	world	say	something	else.	They	know	the	taste	of	truth.
Their	authority	is	not	derived	from	their	scholarship;	they	are	the	authority	unto
themselves.
It	brings	a	problem,	because	they	cannot	use	scriptures;	they	cannot	use	ordinary
means	of	communication.	Hence,	they	used	anything	that	was	in	front	of	them.
...	 SO	 WE	 SEE	 THEM	 KNOCKING	 CHAIRS	 AND	 RAISING	 WHISKS,
HITTING
THE	 GROUND	 AND	 BRANDISHING	 STICKS,	 BEATING	 A	 DRUM	 OR
ROLLING
BALLS...
Anything,	 just	 to	wake	 you	up.	Because	 the	 question	 is	 not	 of	 teaching	 you	 a
philosophical	understanding;	the	question	is	of	existential	awakening.
When	 for	 the	 first	 time	 the	West	 became	 aware	 of	Zen	masters,	 they	 thought,
"These	people	are	absolutely	crazy!	Somebody	is	asking	about	truth	and	you	hit
him?"
Obviously,	 it	 looked	crazy	--	and	the	more	so	because	the	person	who	is	being
hit,	 in	 deep	 gratitude,	 bows	 down	 and	 touches	 your	 feet!	 The	 West	 was
completely	puzzled.
When	 Zen	 books	 started	 being	 translated	 for	 the	 first	 time,	 the	 Western
philosophers	were	hitting	 their	heads.	They	had	never	heard	 that	by	slapping	a
man	who	 is	asking	a	question,	you	are	answering	him.	They	had	no	 idea	what
was	implied	in	this	hitting	or	slapping.	One	Zen	master	even	threw	a	man	from
the	second-story	window	to	the	ground.
The	man	had	come	 to	 ask,	 "What	 is	 truth?"	Not	only	did	 the	master	give	him
fractures,	he	jumped	on	top	of	him	and	asked	him,	"Do	you	get	it?"
And	the	poor	fellow	had	to	say,	"Yes,	Master."
This	kind	of	incident	was	absolutely	unknown	outside	the	Zen	tradition.	But	you
have	 to	 understand	 it,	what	 is	 implied.	When	 a	 Zen	master	 hits,	 he	 is	 saying,
"You	are	 the	 truth,	and	you	are	asking	about	 it?	Are	you	kidding?	You	are	 the
buddha	 and	 you	 are	 asking	what	 the	 buddha	 is?"	By	 hitting	 you	 he	 is	 simply
saying,	 "Look	 at	 yourself,	 rather	 than	 asking	 like	 a	 beggar	 from	 one	 place	 to
another.	Just	go	in	and	look."	His	hitting	is	a	shock;	in	that	shock	perhaps	your
thinking	may	stop,	there	is	every	possibility.	You	were	not	expecting	a	hit;	you
had	come	with	deep	humbleness,	touching	the	feet	of	the	master....
And	sometimes	it	has	happened	that	the	person	has	not	even	asked	the	question
and	the	master	has	hit	him,	because	his	very	coming	and	touching	the	feet	means
he	 has	 some	 question	 to	 ask.	 It	 does	 not	matter	what	 question,	 you	 deserve	 a
good	hit!	It	 is	 throwing	you	back	to	yourself;	 it	 is	saying	in	an	existential	way
that	you	are	the	answer	--	don't	seek	it	anywhere.
Having	 no	 other	way	 to	 communicate,	 they	 devised	 anything	 that	might	wake
you	up,	throw	you	upon	yourself.	Asking	a	question	means	you	are	putting	the
responsibility	 on	 the	 master	 to	 answer	 you.	 But	 his	 answer	 cannot	 be	 your
answer.
Nobody	else's	answer	can	be	your	answer.	Your	answer	has	to	grow	within	you,
just	as	a	 rose	grows.	That's	what	 the	master	 is	 saying	by	hitting	you:	Don't	go
anywhere,	just	go	in;	stop	asking,	stop	begging,	because	you	are	already	in	the
kingdom	of	the	buddhas	but	you	have	not	looked	in.	Perhaps	a	good	hit,	perhaps
the	master	 throwing	 the	 disciple	 from	 the	window	may	 awaken	 him	 from	 his
somnambulistic	state	 --	 the	state	 in	which	we	all	are...	half	asleep,	half	awake,
just	at	the	minimum	awake.
The	major	part	of	our	being	is	fast	asleep.	According	to	modern	psychologists,
only	 one	 part	 out	 of	 ten	 is	 awake;	 nine-tenths	 are	 fast	 asleep.	With	 this	much
sleep	within	you,	it	 is	impossible	to	know	the	truth,	to	know	love,	to	know	the
nature	of	existence.
Daio	is	saying	that	these	ancient	masters	had	to	fall	back	on	strange	methods,	but
there	was	simply	one	reason:	in	some	way	to	wake	you	up.
DAIO	CONTINUED:
EVEN	 THOUGH	 THIS	 IS	 SO,	 EMINENT	 GENCHU,	 YOU	 HAVE
TRAVELED	ALL
OVER	AND	 SPENT	A	 LONG	 TIME	 IN	MONASTERIES.	 DON'T	WORRY
ABOUT
SUCH	OLD	CALENDAR	DAYS	AS	THESE	I	MENTIONED	--	JUST	GO	BY
THE
LIVING	ROAD	YOU	SEE	ON	YOUR	OWN.
He	 is	 saying	 all	 the	 old	 masters	 and	 the	 buddhas	 and	 the	 patriarchs	 are	 old
calendars	--
don't	be	bothered	about	them.	Follow	the	living	stream	which	you	see	with	your
own	eyes	 --	no	belief,	no	 faith,	 simply	be	clear.	Zen	 requires	of	 the	disciple	 a
clarity,	an	intelligence,	an	awareness,	which	have	not	been	required	by	any	other
religion	in	the	world	or	by	any	other	philosophy	in	the	world.	Its	requirement	is
absolute.
Daio	says,	"Don't	worry	about	such	old	calendars.	JUST	GO	BY	THE	LIVING
ROAD,	 from	 where	 your	 life	 is	 coming."	 From	 whatever	 point	 your	 life	 is
arising,	that	is	the	living	road.	It	is	not	outside	you.	You	have	to	dig	deep	within
yourself	 for	 the	 roots	 and	 for	 the	 way	 that	 connects	 you	 with	 the	 universal
existence.	It	is	simply	an	internal	affair.
JUST	GO	BY	THE	LIVING	ROAD	YOU	SEE	ON	YOUR	OWN	--	don't	ask
me	and	don't	ask	anyone	else	what	 the	 living	road	 is.	 Just	close	your	eyes	and
see	for	yourself	what	the	living	road	is.	You	are	alive	--	that	much	is	certain;	it	is
proved	by	your	questioning.	You	are	breathing.	Just	close	your	eyes	and	find	out
where	all	these	branches	are	joined	to	the	trunk,	and	where	the	roots	are	hidden
in	the	universal	energy.
This	is	 the	living	road,	and	nobody	can	point	 it	out	 to	you.	You	have	to	find	it
yourself.
JUST	 GO	 BY	 THE	 LIVING	 ROAD	 YOU	 SEE	 ON	 YOUR	 OWN;	 GOING
EAST,	 GOING	WEST,	 LIKE	 A	 HAWK	 SAILING	 THROUGH	 THE	 SKIES.
Don't	be	worried	-
-	wherever	it	leads,	go.	Finally	it	will	bring	you	to	the	very	center	of	existence.
IN	THE	BLINK	OF	AN	EYE,	YOU	CROSS	OVER	TO	THE	OTHER	SIDE.
The	happening	happens	only	 in	 the	blink	of	 an	 eye.	The	distance	between	 the
buddha	and	the	no-buddha	is	so	small,	the	distinction	between	the	awake	and	the
asleep	is	so	small,	that	just	in	the	blink	of	an	eye	you	have	already	moved	to	the
further	shore,	to	the	other	shore.
It	is	to	be	understood	clearly:	the	road	is	not	very	long.	To	call	it	a	road	is	simply
symbolic;	 there	 is	no	other	way	 to	 say	 it.	 It	 is	 simply	a	 change	of	vision:	you
were	 looking	 out,	 you	 close	 your	 eyes	 and	 you	 look	 within.	 And	 you	 go	 on,
deepening,	inside,	as	far	as	you	can,	and	you	are	bound	to	find	the	source	of	your
life.
It	is	just	as	if	a	roseflower	were	trying	to	find	the	source	of	its	life.	Where	is	it
going	to	find	it?	It	will	have	to	move	withinwards,	into	the	branches,	towards	the
roots,	from	where	it	is	getting	all	its	nourishment	and	all	its	life.
We	also	have	roots,	but	they	are	invisible.
Zen	 is	 nothing	 but	 a	 discovery	 of	 our	 roots.	The	man	who	 knows	 his	 roots	 is
called	the	buddha.
ON	ANOTHER	OCCASION	DAIO	SAID	TO	KUSHO:	THE	CAUSE	AND
CONDITIONS	OF	THE	ONE	GREAT	CONCERN	OF	THE	ENLIGHTENED
ONES	IS
NOT	APART	FROM	YOUR	DAILY	AFFAIRS.	THERE	IS	NO	DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN	 HERE	 AND	 THERE.	 IT	 PERVADES	 PAST	 AND	 PRESENT,
SHINING
THROUGH	THE	HEAVENS,	MIRRORING	THE	EARTH.	THAT	IS	WHY	IT
IS	SAID
THAT	 EVERYTHING	 IN	 THE	 LAST	 MYRIAD	 EONS	 IS	 RIGHT	 IN	 THE
PRESENT.
The	past	--	immense	past,	beginningless	past	--	is	behind	you.	But	where	has	it
gone?	An	 immense	 future	 --	 eternal	 future,	 endless	 future	 --	 is	 ahead	 of	 you.
Where	is	it	hiding?
Zen's	understanding	is	that	in	the	present	moment	the	whole	past	is	hidden,	and
in	 the	 present	 moment	 the	 whole	 future	 also	 is	 hidden.	 The	 present	 moment
contains	 the	 whole	 universe	 --	 past,	 present,	 future.	 If	 you	 can	 manage	 to
understand	the	present	moment,	you	have	understood	the	whole	phenomenon	of
eternity.
Before	 Albert	 Einstein,	 everybody	 thought	 that	 the	 atom	 was	 the	 smallest
particle	which	existed.	Up	to	Einstein	nobody	had	been	able	to	split	the	atom,	so
it	 was	 thought	 to	 be	 the	 last	 division	 of	 matter	 that	 we	 could	 make.	 It	 was
impossible	to	cut	the	atom	in	two	parts;	the	atom	was	a	solid	entity.	But	Albert
Einstein	managed	to	split	the	atom,	and	found	that	by	splitting	it,	a	tremendous
energy	which	is	hiding	in	it	explodes.
Nobody	had	ever	conceived	that	in	such	a	particle,	which	is	not	even	visible	to
the	eye,	so	much	energy	is	contained	that	it	can	destroy	a	big	city	like	Hiroshima
or	Nagasaki	within	 three	minutes.	 It	 consumed	both	cities	 leaving	behind	only
traces,	ruins,	skeletons....
I	have	been	sent	by	a	friend	a	picture	of	a	small	girl,	who	must	have	been	going
up	 the	 stairs	 to	 the	 first	 floor	 of	 her	 house,	 carrying	 her	 books	 to	 do	 some
homework.	 She	 was	 just	 half	 way	 up	 the	 stairs	 when	 the	 atom	 bomb	 fell	 on
Hiroshima	and	everything	was	burned	within	three	minutes.	He	has	sent	me	the
picture	 of	 the	 girl.	 She	 was	 burned	 with	 her	 books,	 and	 her	 image	 remained
imprinted	on	the	wall	--	just	the	shape	of	her	body,	and	the	small	bag	in	which
she	was	carrying	her	homework.
Just	as	the	atom	was	once	unknown...	and	now	we	have	gone	hundreds	of	years
ahead	of	Albert	Einstein.	Now	we	are	able	not	only	to	divide	the	atom,	we	can
divide	the	divisions	of	the	atom.	Those	divisions	of	the	atom	carry	even	bigger
power	sources,	condensed.
The	same	is	true	about	the	moment	of	time.	It	contains	all	past	and	all	future...
and	of	course,	the	present.
So	 the	 man	 who	 is	 meditating	 forgets	 all	 the	 past,	 drops	 all	 longings	 for	 the
future.	 It	 is	 enough	 to	 know	 the	 present.	 By	 knowing	 it,	 by	 entering	 into	 its
complexities,	you	will	 know	 the	whole	universe.	And	when	you	 reach	 to	your
life	 source...	 that	 too	 is	 atomic,	 an	 individual	 life	 source.	 But	 it	 has	 to	 be
connected	with	 the	universe	 in	 some	way;	otherwise	you	cannot	 live.	So	once
you	find	your	life	source,	you	have	found	the	way.
Just	in	the	blink	of	an	eye,	you	are	on	the	other	shore.	You	have	entered	into	the
universal	existence.
Zen	is	perhaps	the	only	scientific	approach	to	religious	experience.
WE	 VALUE	 THE	 GREAT	 SPIRIT	 OF	 A	 HERO	 ONLY	 IN	 THOSE
CONCERNED.
BEFORE	 ANY	 SIGNS	 BECOME	 DISTINCT,	 BEFORE	 ANY
ILLUSTRATION	IS
EVIDENT,	 CONCENTRATE	 FIERCELY,	 LOOKING,	 LOOKING,	 COMING
OR
GOING,	TILL	YOUR	EFFORT	IS	COMPLETELY	RIPE.
All	 is	 hidden	 in	 the	 looking,	 in	 the	 watching;	 in	 seeing	 so	 fiercely	 that	 your
whole	energy	is	concentrated.	Then	existence	cannot	remain	a	mystery	to	you.	In
that	 concentration	 you	 become	 ripe,	 and	 you	 deserve	 that	 all	 the	mysteries	 be
open	to	you.	IN	THE	MOMENT
OF	A	THOUGHT	YOU	ATTAIN	UNION	--	just	in	a	moment.
Once	you	have	reached	your	life	source,	then	it	is	only	a	question	of	a	moment,
the	blink	of	an	eye,	and	you	have	found	the	union	with	existence.
THE	MIND	 OF	 BIRTH	 AND	 DEATH	 IS	 DESTROYED	 AND	 SUDDENLY
YOU
CLEARLY	SEE	YOUR	ORIGINAL	APPEARANCE,	THE	SCENE	OF	YOUR
NATIVE	 LAND;	 EACH	 PARTICULAR	DISTINCTLY	CLEAR.	YOU	THEN
SEE
AND	HEAR	JUST	AS	THE	BUDDHAS	DID,	KNOW	AND	ACT	AS	THE
ENLIGHTENED	ANCESTORS	DID.
Knowing	 the	source	of	your	 life,	and	 taking	a	quantum	leap	 in	 the	blink	of	an
eye	to	the	other	shore,	is	the	union	with	the	whole,	the	cosmos.	After	this	union
you	behave	like	a	buddha.	You	cannot	do	otherwise.	Your	actions,	your	gestures,
your	words	 or	 your	 silences,	 your	movement	 or	 your	 no-movement,	will	 have
the	 same	 quality	 as	 that	 of	 any	 buddha.	 All	 buddhas	 participate	 in	 the	 same
cosmic	source.
Zen	is	not	in	search	of	any	God.	Its	search	can	be	said	to	be	union	--	the	union
with	the	whole.	And	the	union	makes	you	all	that	is,	has	been,	will	be.	Nothing
is	left	out	of	the	whole,	and	you	become	one	with	it.
The	first	missionaries	who	had	come	to	Japan	to	convert	people	to	Christianity
were	 amazed	 by	 the	 Zen	 masters.	 When	 they	 came	 across	 a	 Zen	 master...
because	others	had	told	them,	"Don't	bother	us.	You	just	transform	a	certain	Zen
master	whom	I	have	loved,	and	if	he	changes	to	Christianity,	even	if	he	goes	to
hell	I	am	ready	to	go	with	him.	But	don't	bother	with	me.	You	just	change	that
Zen	 master."	 And	 the	 missionaries	 approached	 the	 Zen	 masters	 with	 their
gospels.	The	Zen	masters	 laughed;	 they	said,	"You	don't	understand	religion	at
all	 and	 you	 are	 converting	 people	 into	 religion.	 You	 don't	 have	 the	 taste
yourself."
One	missionary	was	very	angry.	He	opened	the	Bible	and	read	the	Sermon	on	the
Mount.
It	 is	a	beautiful	sermon	and	he	was	thinking,	"Now,	let	us	see	what	 this	fellow
says."
After	three	or	four	lines	the	Zen	master	said,	"Shut	up!	I	can	say	only	this	much,
that	this	guy,	whoever	has	written	these	lines,	will	become	a	buddha	sometime	in
the	future.	He	is	on	the	path.	This	much	I	can	certainly	say,	that	some	day	he	will
become	 a	 buddha.	But	 don't	 take	 it	 seriously,	 because	 you	will	 also	 become	 a
buddha	 one	 day.	 And	 remember,	 for	 becoming	 a	 buddha,	 Buddhism	 is	 not
necessary."
That	 was	 the	 great	 approach,	 that	 for	 becoming	 a	 buddha,	 Buddhism	 is	 not
necessary.
Nothing	is	necessary;	the	buddha	is	already	asleep	in	you,	just	some	situation	is
needed	in	which	he	can	be	awakened.	All	Zen	monasteries	were	doing	only	one
thing	 --	 creating	 situations	 so	 that	 the	buddha	 is	 awake.	 It	 is	 not	 something	 to
which	you	are	converted,	it	is	your	own	nature.
The	 Christian	 missionaries	 were	 at	 a	 loss,	 because	 these	 Zen	 masters	 never
talked	about	God.	They	said,	"What	is	the	point?	You	don't	even	know	yourself
and	you	are	talking	about	God.	Who	has	seen	God?	And	what	will	you	do	even
if	 you	 meet	 him?"	 It	 will	 be	 a	 very	 awkward	 situation.	 God	 standing	 before
you...	you	will	find	yourself	in	a	very	weird	space	--	what	to	do	now?
I	have	 told	you	 the	story	of	Rabindranath	Tagore.	 In	one	of	his	best	poems	he
wrote,	"I	have	seen	God	many	times	but	he	was	always	far	away	beside	a	star.	I
followed	but	by	the	time	I	reached	there	he	had	moved	to	some	other	place,	far
away.	It	had	been	going	on	and	on	for	many	lives.	Finally	I	 reached	the	place,
the	house	where	 it	was	written	on	 the	door:	Here	 lives	 the	Lord	of	 the	World,
Father	God."
He	was	 just	 going	 to	 knock	 and	 became	 suddenly	 aware:	 "Just	 think	 twice	 --
what	am	I	going	to	do	if	I	meet	him?	I	am	not	prepared	at	all.	After	meeting	him
there	is	nothing	to	do.	Your	whole	life	has	been	structured	in	searching	for	God.
You	know	how	to	search,	you	know	how	to	fast,	you	know	how	to	pray,	but	you
don't	know....	When	you	have	met	God,	there	is	no	point	in	fasting	and	there	is
no	point	in	searching	and	there	is	no	point	in	prayer.	What	are	you	going	to	do?
You	will	be	suffocated!"
Seeing	the	situation,	he	took	his	shoes	in	his	hands,	out	of	fear	that	when	he	went
back	down	the	steps	God	might	hear	the	sound	of	the	shoes.	He	might	open	the
door	and	say,
"Where	are	you	going?"	And	then	he	ran	away	as	fast	as	he	could.
The	poem	has	a	tremendous	beauty.	It	says,	"Since	then	I	am	again	searching.	I
know	where	God	is,	so	I	avoid	only	that	place!	But	I	go	on	searching	because	in
searching	 there	 is	 so	 much	 joy,	 and	 I	 am	 thought	 to	 be	 a	 great	 saint.	 I	 am
enjoying	the	great	adventure	of	searching	for	God.	There	is	only	one	thing	I	have
to	remember	--	not	to	go	to	that	place	again!	But	the	whole	world	is	available	to
search,	except	that	house."
Zen	has	never	bothered	about	God;	neither	has	it	said	anything	against	God.	That
is	a	very	strange	situation	to	understand,	because	people	either	believe	in	God	or
not.	But	Zen	is	simply	unconcerned.	There	is	no	question	of	belief	or	disbelief;	it
simply	puts	God	out	of	the	way.	It	is	unnecessary	luggage.
Zen	has	taken	only	the	essential	point,	and	that	is	the	source	of	your	life.	Just	go
deepening	on	that	road	so	that	you	can	reach	the	final	transformation,	from	the
individual	to	the	universal.
Just	before	his	death	Basui	turned	to	the	crowd	that	had	gathered	around	and	said
in	a	loud	voice:
LOOK	STRAIGHT	AHEAD.
WHAT	IS	THERE?
IF	YOU	SEE	IT	AS	IT	IS
YOU	WILL	NEVER	ERR.
He	is	talking	about	inside.	These	are	his	last	words;	he	is	saying,	"Look	straight
forward!"	He	is	not	telling	anybody,	he	is	simply	saying	it	to	himself,	LOOK
STRAIGHT	AHEAD.	WHAT	IS	THERE?	--	just	a	pure	clarity,	a	silent	sky,	an
eternal	silence.	If	you	see	it	as	it	is,	without	any	preconceived	ideas,	without	any
religions	 and	 philosophies	 --	 just	 as	 it	 is	 --	 you	will	 never	 err.	You	will	 never
make	a	mistake.	You	will	reach	directly	like	an	arrow,	and	hit	the	moon.
Zen's	concern	is	absolutely	you	--	you	in	your	original	nature.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
IS	 IT	 BECAUSE	 YOU	 SPEAK	 FROM	 YOUR	 OWN	 FUNDAMENTAL
EXPERIENCE
THAT	YOUR	WORDS	SPONTANEOUSLY	IMPRESS	ONE	AS	TRUE,	AS
UNEQUIVOCAL	 COMMON	 SENSE,	 EVEN	 THOUGH	 THE	 LISTENER
MAY	NOT
HAVE	HAD	SUCH	EXPERIENCE?
FROM	 THE	 FIRST	 SENTENCE	 OF	 YOURS	 THAT	 I	 EVER	 READ	 --
BEFORE	I	COULD	HAVE	DEVELOPED	THE	EYES	AND	EARS	OF	LOVE	-
-	THERE	WAS	NO
DECISION	 TO	 CHOOSE	 TO	 ACCEPT	 THAT	 YOU	 WERE	 RIGHT.	 YOU
SIMPLY
WERE	--	WHETHER	IT	SUITED	ME	OR	NOT.	I	JUST	DON'T	GET	IT:	HOW
IS	IT
THAT	OTHERS	COULD	POSSIBLY	FEEL	OTHERWISE?
Maneesha,	 you	 can	 speak	 on	 the	 authority	 of	 others,	 but	 then	 your	words	 are
dead	corpses,	like	the	dry	roses	you	can	find	in	Holy	Bibles.	But	when	someone
speaks	from	his	own	experience	it	is	a	living	phenomenon.	You	may	agree	with
it,	 you	may	 not	 agree,	 but	 it	 leaves	 the	 impact	 on	 you	 that	 you	 have	 been	 in
contact	with	someone	who	knows.
I	 am	not	 authoritarian,	 but	 I	 am	an	 authority.	And	you	have	 to	understand	 the
difference	between	the	two.	The	authoritarian	is	always	within	quotation	marks.
He	 is	 a	 great	 scholar,	 you	 cannot	 dispute	 him.	 His	 argument	 is	 very	 valid,
supported	by	the	scriptures.
His	authoritarian	attitude	is	derived	from	scriptures,	from	the	past,	from	others'
experiences.
I	 am	not	 authoritarian	but	 certainly	 I	 am	 the	authority.	 I	 say	only	 that	which	 I
know.	And	because	I	say	only	that	which	I	know,	you	may	agree	with	it	or	not,	it
does	 not	matter;	 its	 truth	 rings	 a	 bell	 in	 your	 heart.	And	whenever	 something
rings	 a	 bell	 in	 your	 heart,	 don't	 listen	 to	 the	mind	 --	 the	mind	may	 not	 agree.
Listen	to	the	heart	because	the	heart	knows	better.
The	 heart	 is	 ancient;	 the	 mind	 is	 a	 very	 recent	 development.	 And	 the	 mind's
development	 is	 from	 outside	 experiences.	 The	 heart	 knows	 something	 of	 the
inner,	 it	 knows	nothing	of	 the	outer.	So	when	your	 heart	 rings	 a	 bell,	whether
your	mind	agrees	with	it	or	not,	don't	be	worried;	you	are	very	close	to	the	truth.
If	 any	 person's	 presence	 simply	 overwhelms	 you	 ...	 that	 is	 the	 only	 intimate
communion	between	a	disciple	and	a	master.	That	 is	 the	only	way	 the	disciple
can	decide	that	he	has	found	his	master.	He	is	overwhelmed,	he	is	surrounded	by
the	 master's	 presence	 from	 all	 sides.	 The	 mind	may	 be	 freaking	 out,	 because
mind	is	always	afraid	of	being	overwhelmed	by	someone.	The	mind	is	basically
egoistic	and	to	be	overwhelmed	means	the	ego	may	be	gone	like	a	shadow.	Mind
is	afraid	of	truth,	mind	is	afraid	of	reality,	because	mind	consists	of	all	kinds	of
illusions,	lies.	Truth	will	expose	it;	hence	it	avoids	the	truth.
But	you	are	fortunate,	Maneesha.	If	your	heart	says	that	you	have	found	a	man
who	is	speaking	on	his	own	authority,	then	a	revolution	is	possible	in	your	very
life,	 too.	And	 that	 revolution	 is	happening	day	by	day,	 it	 is	not	something	 that
stops.	It	goes	on	happening	until	you	are	completely	burned	and	dissolved.
That	 fortunate	 moment	 will	 also	 come.	 It	 is	 not	 very	 far.	 This	 is	 a	 good
beginning.
Before	you	enter	into	the	living	way,	inwards,	don't	forget	to	come	back	again.	I
am	always	afraid	for	Sardar	Gurudayal	Singh.	I	have	even	ordered	a	grave	to	be
made	 ready,	 because	 some	 day	 somebody	 may	 not	 come	 back.	 And	 Sardar
Gurudayal	Singh	is	standing	in	the	queue	almost	at	the	front,	very	close.	He	will
laugh	and	simply	go	away.
We	will	 celebrate...	 and	 he	 knows	 that	 there	 is	 no	 need	 to	 be	worried.	But	 he
goes	on	coming	back,	because	one	never	knows	what	joke	I	am	going	to	tell.
I	will	miss	him	also,	because	he	is	the	only	man	in	the	whole	world	who	laughs
before	the	joke	is	told.	Such	trust	is	very	difficult	to	find.	But	I	warn	you	all:	go
deep,	but	don't	go	too	far.	When	Nivedano	gives	the	call	to	come	back,	be	a	good
boy!
Jesus	and	Peter	are	sipping	their	iced	tea	while	sunbathing	on	the	shore	of	Lake
Galilee.
A	 group	 of	 children	 nearby	 start	 throwing	 rocks	 in	 the	water.	 They	 laugh	 and
shout	and	kick	up	the	sand.
His	 peace	 completely	 destroyed,	 Peter	 sits	 up.	 "Hey!	 You	 kids!"	 he	 barks	 at
them.	"You	get	outta	here!"
But	 Jesus	 pushes	 up	 his	Ray-Ban	 sunglasses,	wipes	 the	 sand	 off	 his	 face,	 and
says,	"No,	Peter.	Let	the	children	come	unto	me."
Five	minutes	later,	the	noise	is	deafening	as	screaming	kids,	splashing	water,	and
flying	sand	fill	the	air.	Peter,	hung	over	from	last	night's	wine,	gets	totally	pissed
off.	"I	said,	you	kids	just	get	the	hell	outta	here!"	he	screams.
But	 again	 Jesus	 sits	 up,	wipes	 the	 sand	 off	 himself,	 raises	 his	 hand	 and	 says,
"Peter,	I	told	you:	let	the	children	come	unto	me	--	so	that	I	can	kick	their	little
asses!"
Klopski	is	sitting	with	Seamus	at	the	Dancing	Duck	Pub,	sipping	his	beer.
"Hey,	Seamus,"	says	the	Polack,	"how	do	you	do	so	well	with	the	girls?"
"Easy,"	 says	 Seamus.	 "You	 have	 to	 be	 sophisticated,	 and	 you	 have	 to	 have	 a
gimmick."
"Sophisticated	is	easy,"	says	Klopski,	swallowing	down	his	tenth	beer.	"But	what
is	a	gimmick?"
"Well,"	replies	Seamus,	"for	example,	I	painted	a	white	circle	on	the	dashboard
of	my	car.	The	girl	usually	asks	me	what	it	means.	Then	I	very	casually	explain
that	it	stands	for	purity.	The	conversation	generally	turns	to	abstract	white	things,
like	virginity.	From	there	it	is	easy	to	talk	them	into	it."
"Okay,"	says	Klopski,	"I	think	I	got	it."
The	next	evening	Klopski	paints	a	white	circle	on	the	dashboard	of	his	car,	and
then	goes	to	pick	up	his	date,	Lucy.
"That	 is	 rather	 unusual	 --	 having	 a	 white	 circle	 on	 your	 dash,"	 says	 Lucy	 to
Klopski.
"Yes,	 it	 is,"	 replies	 Klopski,	 thinking	 quickly	 as	 he	 adjusts	 his	 tie.	 "Do	 you
wanna	fuck?"
"You	are	drunk!"	shouts	the	barman	of	the	Groggy	Doggie	Pub,	at	Paddy,	who
just	has	slipped	slowly	onto	the	floor	again.
"I'm	not	drunk	at	all!"	 insists	Paddy,	picking	himself	up.	"In	fact,	 I'm	not	even
drunk	a	little	bit,	and	I'll	prove	it	to	you.	Now,	you	see	that	cat	just	coming	in	the
door?	Well,	it	has	only	got	one	eye."
"You're	drunker	than	I	thought,"	says	the	barman.	"That	cat	is	going	out!"
Nivedano...
Nivedano...
Be	silent,	close	your	eyes.
Feel	your	body	to	be	completely	frozen.
Look	inwards,	straight	to	the	very	source	of	your	life.
Go	deeper	without	any	fear.
Only	this	way	has	anyone	found	himself	as	a	buddha.	This	is	the	only	living	road
that	leads	you	to	your	cosmic	home.
Without	hesitation	go	on,	go	on.
Gather	all	the	experience	of	silence,	the	bliss	and	the	benediction.
To	make	it	more	clear,	Nivedano...
Relax,	watch	your	mind	and	body,	separate	from	you.
You	are	only	a	watcher.
This	point	of	being	a	watcher	is	the	buddha.
Recognize	 your	 buddha	 nature;	 it	 is	 just	 a	 mirror	 --	 reflecting	 everything	 but
unaffected.
Nothing	leaves	a	mark	on	your	watching.	The	mirror	remains	empty.
This	 emptiness	 can	 at	 any	 moment	 take	 a	 quantum	 leap,	 and	 you	 will	 find
yourself	on	the	other	shore.
Just	in	a	split	second	you	can	be	one	with	the	whole.
This	union	is	the	authentic	goal	of	religiousness.
A	beautiful	evening...
Unfortunately,	how	many	are	able	to	enjoy	it?
So	few,	but	we	have	to	spread	this	fire,	this	cool	silence,	just	like	a	breeze	around
the	globe.
This	silence	is	going	to	become	the	womb	for	the	new	man	to	be	born.
You	prepare	the	way.
Nivedano...
Come	back.
But	come	back	like	buddhas,	with	great	dignity,	with	grace,	with	silence.
Sit	for	a	few	moments,	just	gathering,	remembering,	collecting	the	experience	of
your	silent	moments.
You	have	to	remain	a	buddha	twenty-four	hours.
It	is	not	an	action,	it	is	your	nature.
It	has	to	be	expressed	in	all	your	actions,	in	your	words,	in	your	silences,	in	your
songs,	in	your	dances.
But	you	remain	the	watcher,	the	buddha.
Okay,	Maneesha?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.
Can	we	celebrate	all	the	buddhas?
Yes!

WORLD	 OF	 DISTINCTIONS	 IS	 TO	MAKE	 A	MAN'S	 GAZE	 STRAIGHT,
AND	TO
GIVE	HIM	STRENGTH	AS	HE	STANDS	ON	THE	BRINK	OF	THE	RIVER
BANK.
FOR	THE	PAST	TWO	OR	THREE	YEARS,	I	HAVE	BEEN	GIVING,	IN	MY
INTERVIEWS,	THREE	KOANS:	"THE	TRUE	FACE	BEFORE	FATHER	AND
MOTHER	 WERE	 BORN,"	 "THE	 HEART,	 THE	 BUDDHA,"	 AND	 "NO
HEART,	NO
BUDDHA."	 FOR	 ONE	 FACING	 THE	 TURBULENCE	 OF	 LIFE-AND-
DEATH,	THESE	KOANS	CLEAR	AWAY	THE	SANDY	SOIL	OF	WORLDLY
CONCERNS
AND	OPEN	UP	 THE	GOLDEN	 TREASURE	WHICH	WAS	 THERE	 FROM
THE
BEGINNING,	THE	AGELESS	ROOT	OF	ALL	THINGS.
HOWEVER,	IF	AFTER	GRAPPLING	WITH	A	KOAN	FOR	THREE	OR	FIVE
YEARS,	THERE	IS	STILL	NO	SATORI,	THEN	THE	KOAN	SHOULD	BE
DROPPED;	 OTHERWISE	 IT	 MAY	 BECOME	 AN	 INVISIBLE	 CHAIN
ROUND	ONE.
EVEN	 THESE	 TRADITIONAL	 METHODS	 CAN	 BECOME	 A	 MEDICINE
WHICH
POISONS.
IN	GENERAL,	MEDITATION	HAS	TO	BE	DONE	WITH	URGENCY,	BUT
IF,	 AFTER	 THREE	 OR	 FIVE	 YEARS	 THE	 URGENCY	 IS	 STILL
MAINTAINED
FORCIBLY,	 THE	 TENSION	 BECOMES	 A	 WRONG	 ONE	 AND	 IT	 IS	 A
SERIOUS
CONDITION.	MANY	LOSE	HEART	AND	GIVE	UP	AS	A	RESULT.
AN	 ANCIENT	 HAS	 SAID,	 "SOMETIMES	 QUICKLY	 AND	 SOMETIMES
SLOWLY,	SOMETIMES	HOT	ON	THE	TRAIL	AND	SOMETIMES	RESTING
AT	A
DISTANCE."
BUKKO	CONTINUED:
SO	 THIS	 MOUNTAIN	 PRIEST	 NOW	 MAKES	 PEOPLE	 AT	 THIS	 STAGE
THROW
DOWN	 THEIR	 KOAN.	 WHEN	 IT	 IS	 DROPPED	 AND	 THERE	 IS	 A
COOLING
DOWN,	IN	DUE	TIME	THEY	HIT	ON	WHAT	THEIR	OWN	TRUE	NATURE
IS,	AS
THE	SOLUTION	OF	THE	KOAN.
IN	CONCENTRATION	ON	A	KOAN,	THERE	IS	A	TIME	OF	ROUSING	THE
SPIRIT
OF	INQUIRY,	THERE	IS	A	TIME	OF	BREAKING	THE	CLINGING
ATTACHMENTS,	THERE	IS	A	TIME	OF	FURIOUS	DASHING	FORWARD,
AND
THERE	 IS	 A	 TIME	 OF	 DAMPING	 THE	 FUEL	 AND	 STOPPING	 THE
BOILING.
SINCE	 COMING	 TO	 JAPAN,	 THIS	 MOUNTAIN	 PRIEST	 HAS	 BEEN
MAKING	THE
PUPILS	LOOK	INTO	A	KOAN,	BUT	WHEN	THEY	HAVE	DONE	THIS	FOR
A	GOOD	TIME,	HE	TELLS	THEM	TO	THROW	IT	DOWN.	THE	POINT	IS
THAT
MANY	 PEOPLE	 COME	 TO	 SUCCESS	 IF	 THEY	 FIRST	 HAVE	 THE
EXPERIENCE
OF	 WRESTLING	 WITH	 A	 KOAN	 AND	 LATER	 REDUCE	 THE	 EFFORT;
BUT	FEW
COME	TO	SUCCESS	AT	THE	TIME	WHEN	THEY	ARE	PUTTING	OUT
EXCEPTIONAL	EFFORT.
SO	THE	INSTRUCTION	IS	THAT	THOSE	WHO	HAVE	NOT	YET	LOOKED
INTO
A	 KOAN	 ABSOLUTELY	MUST	 DO	 SO,	 BUT	 THOSE	WHO	 HAVE	 HAD
ONE	FOR
A	GOOD	TIME	MUST	THROW	IT	DOWN.	AT	THE	TIME	OF	ZAZEN	THEY
THROW	IT	ALL	AWAY.	THEY	SLEEP	WHEN	IT	 IS	TIME	TO	SLEEP,	GO
WHEN
IT	 IS	TIME	TO	GO,	 SIT	WHEN	 IT	 IS	TIME	TO	SIT,	AND	SO	ON,	AS	 IF
THEY
WERE	NOT	DOING	ZEN	AT	ALL.
Maneesha,	before	I	discuss	what	Bukko	is	saying,	I	have	to	introduce	you	to	the
word	koan.
It	 is	 something	 like	 a	 puzzle	 that	 cannot	 be	 solved	 --	 basically	 insoluble.	 For
example,	how	you	looked	before	you	were	born	--	there	is	no	way	to	solve	the
problem,	 there	 is	nowhere	 to	 find	 the	 answer.	Or	 the	koan	 --	 the	most	 famous
one	--	the	sound	of	one	hand	clapping.	Now,	one	hand	cannot	clap;	for	clapping
the	other	hand	will	be	needed.
So	first	you	have	to	understand	the	meaning	of	koan.	It	is	some	kind	of	statement
which	 has	 no	 answer	 anywhere,	 and	 the	 master	 gives	 it	 to	 the	 disciple	 to
meditate	on	and	 find	 the	answer.	From	 the	very	beginning	 the	disciple	knows,
and	 the	master	 knows,	 there	 is	 no	possible	way	 to	 find	 the	 answer.	But	 it	 is	 a
great	strategy:	when	the	mind	cannot	find	the	answer	--	and	the	meditation	has	to
be	very	urgent,	with	 total	energy	focused	on	 the	koan	--	 the	mind	feels	almost
impotent.	 It	 looks	here	and	 there,	brings	out	 this	answer,	 that	answer,	and	gets
hits	from	the	master	for	bringing	a	wrong	answer.
Every	answer	 is	wrong,	because	 the	very	function	of	 the	koan	is	not	 to	get	 the
answer;	the	very	function	of	the	koan	is	to	tire	your	mind	to	such	a	point	that	it
gives	 up.	 If	 there	were	 an	 answer,	 the	mind	would	 find	 it.	 It	 does	 not	matter
whether	you	are	very	intelligent,	or	not	very	intelligent	--	no	intelligence	of	any
category	can	find	the	answer.
But	naturally,	mind	tries	and	tries.	And	the	disciple	comes	every	morning	to	see
the	 master,	 to	 tell	 him	 what	 he	 has	 found	 in	 the	 twenty-four	 hours.	 In	 the
beginning,	the	disciples	think	perhaps	they	may	be	able	to	make	it	out....
A	disciple	was	given	the	koan	of	one	hand	clapping.	He	heard	the	sound	of	the
wind	passing	through	the	pine	trees,	and	he	thought,	"Perhaps	this	is	the	sound
of	one	hand	clapping."	He	rushed	to	give	the	answer	to	the	master,	but	before	he
could	even	open	his	mouth	he	was	beaten.
He	said,	"This	is	too	much!	I	have	not	said	anything."
The	master	said,	"It	does	not	matter	whether	you	have	said	anything	or	not	--	you
were	going	to	say	something."
The	student	said,	"But	at	least	you	should	have	heard	it	first..."
The	master	said,	"It	does	not	matter,	whatever	you	say	is	going	to	be	wrong.	Just
go	and	meditate!"
When	disciples	become	accustomed,	they	don't	rush	to	the	master	with	answers.
They	know	there	is	no	answer.	Knowing	that	there	is	no	answer,	mind	gives	up.
And	the	whole	strategy	is	very	subtle,	to	put	the	mind	aside;	tired,	exhausted,	it
has	no	desire	to	function	anymore.
The	 moment	 you	 put	 the	 mind	 aside,	 you	 have	 entered	 into	 the	 world	 of
meditation.	 It	 has	nothing	 to	do	with	 the	koan,	but	 the	koan	helped	 to	 tire	 the
mind.
Bukko	is	a	very	practical	master;	most	of	 the	Zen	masters	are	not	so	practical.
They	speak	from	their	peaks	of	consciousness;	Bukko	is	speaking	from	the	same
ground	as	where	you	are.	Hence,	he	is	of	much	more	help	than	the	great	masters
who	speak	from	a	faraway	peak	of	consciousness.	Bukko	knows	that	even	if	they
shout	 they	will	not	be	understood;	 it	 is	better	 to	come	down	to	 the	dark	valley
and	talk	to	people	in	such	a	way	that	they	can	somehow	get	the	point,	that	mind
is	of	no	use	in	the	internal	 journey.	That	 is	 the	point:	 that	mind	is	a	hindrance,
not	a	help;	a	wall,	not	a	bridge.
And	Bukko	is	very	compassionate	in	going	into	the	details	--	no	other	master	has
gone	 into	 the	 details	 --	 and	 even	 giving	 warnings	 that	 the	 method	 is	 not	 a
hundred	percent	foolproof.	No	device	can	be;	even	the	method	itself	can	become
a	hindrance.
AT	THE	BEGINNING	YOU	HAVE	TO	TAKE	UP	A	KOAN,	says	Bukko.	THE
KOAN
IS	SOME	DEEP	SAYING	OF	A	PATRIARCH.	ITS	EFFECT	IN	THIS	WORLD
OF
DISTINCTIONS	IS	TO	MAKE	A	MAN'S	GAZE	STRAIGHT,	AND	TO	GIVE
HIM
STRENGTH	AS	HE	STANDS	ON	THE	BRINK	OF	THE	RIVER	BANK.
Your	mind	is	very	wavering,	wobbly.	A	koan	concentrates	all	your	energies.	A
koan	has	not	to	be	done	in	a	lukewarm	way,	that	is	dangerous.	It	has	to	be	done
with	totality,	so	you	can	exhaust	the	mind	quickly	--	as	quickly	as	possible.
Zen	masters	 have	 experienced	 that	 the	 longest	 period	 is	 three	 years	 --	 if	 you
cannot	get	tired	in	three	years	that	means	you	are	not	putting	your	total	energy
into	it.	You	are	saving	energy,	you	are	not	going	really	hot.	If	you	go	really	hot,
then	in	a	single	moment	you	can	see	straight:	there	is	no	answer.	And	with	the
very	experience	that	there	is	no	answer	at	all,	mind	drops	by	the	side.	You	have
entered	the	space	of	your	being.
But	if	you	go	on	doing	it	so-so,	the	danger	is	that	after	three	years...	if	you	have
not	got	it	yet,	then	it	is	better	to	drop	the	koan.	It	is	not	going	to	help,	it	is	now
going	to	hamper	and	hinder.	It	has	become	just	a	habit.	Sitting	silently,	and	just
by	 the	way,	with	many	 other	 thoughts	 coming	 and	 going,	 one	 thought	 is	 also
there:	 What	 is	 the	 sound	 of	 one	 hand	 clapping?	 But	 you	 are	 not	 totally
concentrated	so	that	only	the	koan	is	there	and	nothing	else.
Bukko	 says,	THE	KOAN	IS	SOME	DEEP	SAYING	OF	A	PATRIARCH.	 ITS
EFFECT
IN	 THIS	 WORLD	 OF	 DISTINCTIONS	 IS	 TO	 MAKE	 A	 MAN'S	 GAZE
STRAIGHT...
to	put	his	whole	energy	straight	on	a	single	point;	to	make	his	consciousness	like
an	arrow	--	not	going	in	all	directions,	a	part	here	and	a	part	there,	a	part	in	the
past	and	a	part	in	the	future,	and	you	are	doing	the	koan	with	whatever	small	bit
is	left	which	has	not	gone	anywhere.	This	way	you	will	never	come	to	the	end;
on	 the	contrary,	 this	will	become	your	habit.	You	will	do	 the	koan	your	whole
life,	it	will	never	bring	meditation	to	you.
So	if	within	three	years	a	koan	has	not	dropped	by	itself,	with	the	mind,	and	you
don't	enter	into	being,	into	the	silence	of	being	where	there	is	no	question	and	no
answer	--
then	 please	 stop	 the	 koan.	 Don't	 let	 it	 become	 a	 habit;	 don't	 let	 it	 become	 a
mental	conditioning.
The	 first	 thing	 is	 to	make	 your	 gaze	 straight,	 and	 to	 give	 you	 strength	 as	 you
stand	on	the	brink	of	the	river	bank.
FOR	THE	PAST	TWO	OR	THREE	YEARS,	I	HAVE	BEEN	GIVING,	IN	MY
INTERVIEWS,	THREE	KOANS:	"THE	TRUE	FACE	BEFORE	FATHER	AND
MOTHER	WERE	BORN...."
Not	 only	 you,	 but	 before	 your	 father	 and	mother	were	 born	 --	 your	 true	 face.
There	is	no	way	to	find	where	you	were,	what	your	true	face	was....
Second,	"THE	HEART,	THE	BUDDHA."	Find	the	heart	which	is	the	buddha.
And	 the	 third,	 "NO	HEART,	NO	BUDDHA."	These	 three	 koans	 he	 has	 used.
There	are	a	thousand	and	one	koans	--	anything	which	is	insoluble,	which	looks
beautiful	but	when	you	start	working	on	it,	you	find	that	you	have	come	to	the
end	of	the	road;	it	does	not	go	anywhere.
FOR	 ONE	 FACING	 THE	 TURBULENCE	 OF	 LIFE-AND-DEATH,	 THESE
KOANS
CLEAR	AWAY	THE	SANDY	SOIL	OF	WORLDLY	CONCERNS	AND	OPEN
UP
THE	 GOLDEN	 TREASURE	 WHICH	 WAS	 THERE	 FROM	 THE
BEGINNING,	THE
AGELESS	ROOT	OF	ALL	THINGS.
The	koan	can	do	a	miracle,	although	it	is	just	a	device.	The	question	is	with	what
urgency,	with	what	totality,	you	make	your	whole	mind	concerned	only	with	the
koan,	twenty-four	hours.	It	is	not	something	that	you	do	for	one	hour	and	forget
about	it.
It	is	a	monastery	method.	Remember,	there	are	methods	which	are	individual	and
you	can	do	anywhere,	and	there	are	methods	which	are	monastery	methods;	you
can	do	them	only	in	a	monastery,	where	you	are	allowed	to	meditate	twenty-four
hours,	where	there	is	nothing	else	to	do	but	to	meditate.
The	koan	is	a	monastery	method.	If	you	can	put	in	all	your	energy,	not	leaving	a
small	chunk	of	your	consciousness	aside,	as	is	the	habit	of	people...	They	never
stake	 everything.	 For	 safety,	 for	 an	 emergency,	 they	 keep	 holding	 something
back.	They	never	put	all	they	have	into	the	method.
I	have	heard,	Mulla	Nasruddin	was	caught	traveling	without	a	ticket.	The	ticket
checker	was	puzzled,	because	Mulla	opened	all	his	suitcases	and	threw	things	all
over	the	compartment,	and	finally,	the	very	effort	of	his	search...	He	had	looked
into	 every	 pocket	 except	 one	 pocket	 on	 the	 left	 side	 of	 his	 coat.	 The	 ticket
checker	noticed	it	and	he	said,
"Your	effort	proves	 that	certainly	you	have	 the	 ticket,	 and	 it	has	got	mixed	up
because	you	are	carrying	so	much	 luggage.	So	don't	be	worried,	when	you	get
off	you	can	look	for	it.	But	one	question	I	have	to	ask	you:	You	have	looked	into
everything	else,	why	don't	you	look	in	your	left-side	pocket?"
Mulla	said,	"Don't	mention	that!"
The	man	said,	"Why?	When	you	are	looking,	then	why	are	you	saving	that	one
pocket?"
He	said,	"That	 is	my	only	hope,	 that	perhaps	it	may	be	there.	If	 it	 is	not	 there,
then	it	is	certain	--	it	is	nowhere.	I	cannot	drop	my	hope.	First	I	will	have	to	look
through	everything."
And	he	was	not	only	looking	into	his	own	suitcases,	he	started	looking	into	other
people's!	The	ticket	checker	said,	"You	stop!	These	are	not	your	suitcases.	Are
you	a	madman?	You	are	not	looking	in	the	pocket	where	I	think	the	ticket	is,	and
you	have	started	opening	other	peoples	suitcases?"
Mulla	said,	"I	will	search	first	throughout	the	world;	only	as	a	last	resort,	when
everything	else	is	finished,	will	I	check	in	my	left	pocket.	That	is	my	only	hope!"
People	always	keep	something	aside,	they	never	put	everything,	in	totality,	at	the
stake.
And	what	they	put	aside	keeps	them	divided.	They	cannot	be	total;	they	remain
only	a	part	involved	and	a	part	not	involved.
So	 the	 first	 thing	 the	 koan	 does	 is	 to	 make	 you	 completely	 straightforward,
pointing	to	a	single	goal,	 like	an	arrow.	If	this	is	done,	soon	your	mind	will	be
tired.	But	if	you	are	saving	some	energy,	your	mind	will	always	rejuvenate	itself.
The	saved	energy	will	never	allow	you	to	be	so	tired	and	so	exhausted	that	you
simply	drop	the	koan,	you	simply	say,
"I	am	fed	up;	I	am	finished.	This	is	stupid	--	there	cannot	be	any	sound	with	one
hand	clapping!"
At	 that	 exhausted	moment,	mind	 stops	 --	 tired,	 utterly	 fed	 up.	With	 the	mind
stopping,	even	for	a	single	moment,	in	the	blink	of	an	eye	you	are	on	the	other
shore.
FOR	 ONE	 FACING	 THE	 TURBULENCE	 OF	 LIFE-AND-DEATH,	 THESE
KOANS
CLEAR	AWAY	THE	SANDY	SOIL	OF	WORLDLY	CONCERNS	AND	OPEN
UP
THE	 GOLDEN	 TREASURE	 WHICH	 WAS	 THERE	 FROM	 THE
BEGINNING,	THE
AGELESS	ROOT	OF	ALL	THINGS.
A	very	 simple	device,	 if	done	 rightly,	 can	open	up	 the	cosmic	 treasure	 --	your
ultimate	home.
HOWEVER,	IF	AFTER	GRAPPLING	WITH	A	KOAN	FOR	THREE	OR	FIVE
YEARS,	THERE	IS	STILL	NO	SATORI,	no	enlightenment,	THEN	THE	KOAN
SHOULD	BE	DROPPED.
This	is	what	I	call	a	compassionate	master.	Bukko	is	very	much	concerned	with
the	disciple	--	not	just	saying	the	ultimate	truths,	but	almost	trailing	along	with
him	by	his	side,	as	a	fellow	traveler,	making	him	aware	of	every	pitfall.
IF,	 FOR	 THREE	OR	 FIVE	YEARS,	 THERE	 IS	 STILL	NO	 SATORI,	 THEN
THE
KOAN	 SHOULD	 BE	 DROPPED;	 OTHERWISE	 IT	 MAY	 BECOME	 AN
INVISIBLE
CHAIN	ROUND	ONE.
You	will	have	started	thinking	that	this	is	a	kind	of	mantra,	a	religious	ritual	--
every	 day	 you	 do	 it.	 Nothing	 happens,	 but	 perhaps	 sometime	 you	 will
accumulate	enough	virtue...
But	what	virtue	can	you	accumulate	by	thinking	about	a	koan	like	the	sound	of
one	hand	clapping?
These	are	not	mantras	that	you	go	on	repeating	all	your	life;	these	are	absolutely
scientific	devices.	But	one	has	to	do	it	with	totality,	then	it	can	open	the	door.	If
you	do	it	half-heartedly,	 then	please	don't	do	it,	because	doing	it	half-heartedly
you	 will	 never	 come	 to	 the	 gate.	 You	 will	 go	 on	 repeating	 your	 nonsense	 --
because	 it	 is	 nonsense;	 you	 have	 to	 remember	 that	 it	 is	 nonsense	 that	 you	 are
repeating.	There	is	no	sound	of	one	hand	clapping,	and	there	is	no	face	that	you
can	find	anywhere	before	your	parents	were	born.
These	are	not	puzzles	that	you	can,	with	great	intelligence,	solve.	They	look	like
puzzles,	but	they	are	not	puzzles;	they	are	simply	absurdities.	But	the	absurd	is
capable	of	 tiring	 the	mind.	Only	 the	absurd	can	 tire	 it	 --	 anything	 rational,	 the
mind	will	manage;	anything	reasonable,	the	mind	will	manage;	anything	logical,
the	 mind	 will	 manage.	 Only	 something	 absurd...	 Mind	 cannot	 manage	 the
absurd;	 it	can	go	nuts	but	 it	cannot	solve	 the	problem.	Before	 it	goes	nuts	you
have	to	drop	the	problem.
Remember	 that	 either	 your	 koan	 can	 drive	 you	 nuts,	 if	 you	 are	 doing	 it	 half-
heartedly,	or	it	can	make	you	a	buddha	if	you	are	doing	it	totally,	wholeheartedly.
The	whole	question	is	of	urgency	and	totality.
Before	the	koan	becomes	a	chain,	a	bondage,	it	has	to	be	dropped.
EVEN	 THESE	 TRADITIONAL	 METHODS	 CAN	 BECOME	 A	 MEDICINE
WHICH
POISONS.
IN	GENERAL,	MEDITATION	HAS	TO	BE	DONE	WITH	URGENCY,	BUT
IF,	 AFTER	 THREE	 OR	 FIVE	 YEARS,	 THE	 URGENCY	 IS	 STILL
MAINTAINED
FORCIBLY,	 THE	 TENSION	 BECOMES	 A	 WRONG	 ONE	 AND	 IT	 IS	 A
SERIOUS
CONDITION.
It	 can	 drive	 you	 mad.	 Just	 think:	 for	 five	 years,	 day	 and	 night,	 a	 person	 is
thinking	about	the	sound	of	one	hand	clapping.	He	will	go	mad!	It	will	become
such	a	psychological	condition	that	he	may	want	to	stop	it	but	it	will	not	stop.	It
will	go	on	and	on	inside	in	him,	"What	is	the	sound	of	one	hand	clapping?"	Even
in	his	sleep	it	will	continue.	The	moment	he	opens	his	eyes,	the	first	thought	will
be,	 "What	 is	 the	 sound	of	 one	hand	 clapping?"	Before	going	 to	 sleep,	 the	 last
thought	will	be,	"What	is	 the	sound	of	one	hand	clapping?"	And	the	same	will
continue	through	the	whole	night	like	an	undercurrent.
Bukko	is	making	it	clear:	"Remember	that	even	medicine	can	become	poison.	It
can	become	out	of	date;	you	should	not	use	it	beyond	its	limit."	And	if	you	want
to	do	it	within	its	limits,	then	do	it	so	totally	that	you	are	finished	before	the	time
limit	on	the	medicine	is	finished.
On	every	bottle	of	medicine,	there	is	a	date,	a	last	date	beyond	which	you	should
not	use	it.	On	every	device	there	is	a	time	limit,	and	if	you	want	to	experience
the	eternal	in	you,	then	don't	go	slowly;	then	be	fast,	before	the	time	limit	on	the
device	is	finished.
And	always	remember	that	it	is	a	nonsense	device,	there	is	no	answer	for	it.	It	is
not	meant	to	have	an	answer;	its	purpose	is	there,	and	the	purpose	is	to	exhaust
your	mind.	So	put	 in	your	 total	energy,	so	 it	 is	exhausted	quickly.	The	quicker
you	exhaust	the	mind,	the	sooner	the	realization,	the	transcendence,	the	opening
of	the	doors	of	your	eternal	treasures.
IN	GENERAL,	MEDITATION	HAS	TO	BE	DONE	WITH	URGENCY,	BUT
IF,	 AFTER	 THREE	 OR	 FIVE	 YEARS,	 THE	 URGENCY	 IS	 STILL
MAINTAINED
FORCIBLY,	 THE	 TENSION	 BECOMES	 A	 WRONG	 ONE	 AND	 IT	 IS	 A
SERIOUS
CONDITION.	MANY	LOSE	HEART	AND	GIVE	UP	AS	A	RESULT.
AN	 ANCIENT	 HAS	 SAID,	 "SOMETIMES	 QUICKLY	 AND	 SOMETIMES
SLOWLY,	SOMETIMES	HOT	ON	THE	TRAIL	AND	SOMETIMES	RESTING
AT	A
DISTANCE."
BUKKO	CONTINUED:
SO	 THIS	 MOUNTAIN	 PRIEST	 NOW	 MAKES	 PEOPLE	 AT	 THIS	 STAGE
THROW
DOWN	 THEIR	 KOAN.	 WHEN	 IT	 IS	 DROPPED	 AND	 THERE	 IS	 A
COOLING
DOWN...
because	 you	were	 going	with	 full	 speed,	 your	mind	was	 becoming	 hotter	 and
hotter,	on	a	single	point	for	years.
Bukko	says,	"I	tell	my	disciples,	now	it	is	time	to	drop	it,	and	let	the	mind	cool
down."
...	 THERE	 IS	 A	 COOLING	DOWN,	 IN	DUE	 TIME	 THEY	HIT	ON	WHAT
THEIR
OWN	TRUE	NATURE	IS,	AS	THE	SOLUTION	OF	THE	KOAN.
When	 the	 mind	 cools	 down,	 that	 is	 almost	 the	 equivalent	 of	 mind	 being	 put
aside.	In	one	case	it	is	sudden	enlightenment,	in	the	other	case	it	will	be	called
gradual	enlightenment.
I	 don't	 use	 koans	 for	 the	 simple	 reason	 that	 you	 are	 not	 in	 a	 monastery.	 The
method	 is	 basically	 a	 monastery	 method	 --	 nobody	 has	 made	 the	 distinction
before.	My	people	are	in	the	world;	they	cannot	put	their	totality	into	meditating
twenty-four	 hours.	 It	 is	 enough	 for	 them	 to	 put	 their	 totality	 into	 it	 for	 a	 few
minutes	and	just	have	a	drink	of	their	eternity,	of	their	immortality,	just	to	have	a
glimpse	of	the	roots.	And	don't	continue	it,	just	let	it	remain	like	a	faraway	echo
surrounding	you.	A	fragrance	--	just	as	when	you	pass	a	rose	garden,	even	if	you
don't	touch	the	roses,	your	clothes	will	carry	the	fragrance	of	the	roses.
You	are	in	the	world,	and	I	want	everyone	of	my	sannyasins	to	be	in	the	world.	I
don't	want	you	to	be	in	a	monastery,	because	a	monastery	takes	all	your	twenty-
four	hours,	 destroys	 all	 your	 capabilities	 for	 creativity.	And	most	 often	people
become	so	tired	that	they	leave	the	monastery	and	enter	another	monastery.	This
is	a	constant	phenomenon	in	Japan:	people	who	get	tired	of	one	monastery	move
into	another	monastery.	And	because	they	don't	have	to	work	at	anything	--	food
is	supplied	by	 the	monastery,	clothes	are	supplied	by	 the	monastery;	 their	only
work	 is	 to	 concentrate	 on	 the	 koan	 --	 either	 they	 become	 fed	 up	 with	 the
monastery	and	they	think	something	is	wrong	with	the	koan	because	nothing	is
happening	 and	 three	 years	 have	 passed,	 or	 they	 go	 nuts.	 Their	 urgency	 and
totality	takes	a	wrong	turn	and	they	go	mad.
This	happens	constantly	in	Zen	monasteries.	In	fact,	every	Zen	monastery	has	a
special	retreat	place	for	monks	who	go	mad.	But	their	method	to	bring	the	mad
monk	 back	 into	 the	world	 is	 very	 simple.	Modern	 psychiatry	 and	 psychology
should	study	the	method	because	what	they	cannot	do	in	ten	years	time	is	done
within	three	weeks	in	the	monasteries.	And	in	fact,	nothing	is	done;	 just	 in	the
monastery,	in	a	faraway	place	in	the	bamboos,	hidden	by	the	side	of	a	river,	is	a
small	 cottage.	 The	man	 is	 left	 alone	 there,	 and	 is	 told	 not	 to	 talk	 to	 anybody.
Anyway,	nobody	passes	by	there	except	the	man	who	brings	the	food	every	day.
But	he	is	not	allowed	to	talk	to	the	man;	neither	is	the	man	allowed	even	to	make
gestures	or	to	say	hello.
Three	weeks	 sitting	 silently,	nobody	 to	 talk	 to,	nothing	 to	do...	 the	mind	cools
down.
What	 psychoanalysis	 cannot	 do	 in	 fifteen	 years,	 the	 Zen	 monastery	 has	 been
doing	for	one	thousand	years	for	thousands	of	monks.
Nobody	goes	to	visit	for	those	three	weeks;	the	man	is	just	left	alone.	At	first	he
talks	 to	 himself;	 then	 slowly	 slowly	 the	 heat	 goes	 away,	 he	 cools	 down.	 A
beautiful	 scene:	 the	 flowers,	 the	 bamboos,	 and	 the	 river;	 and	 no	 other	 man
around.	And	as	he	cools	down,	he	is	brought	back	to	the	monastery.
But	 in	 any	 case,	 one	 should	not	do	 a	method	 in	 such	 a	way	 that	 it	 drives	you
mad.	And	the	reason	why	people	go	mad	through	certain	methods	is	that	they	are
trying	to	be	clever.	They	keep	a	certain	amount	of	energy	on	the	side	--	in	the	left
pocket!	--	so	they	are	never	total.	And	unless	they	are	total,	the	mind	cannot	be
put	aside.	So	totality	is	really	the	function,	the	purpose	of	a	koan.
I	am	not	using	it,	and	I	will	not	tell	anybody	else	to	use	it	unless	he	is	part	of	a
monastery	 where	 he	 has	 no	 mundane	 work	 to	 do,	 where	 he	 is	 completely
dependent	on	the	society.
But	when	you	are	dependent	on	the	society,	you	cannot	be	rebellious.	That's	why
Zen	masters	have	achieved	buddhahood	but	their	buddhahood	is	not	a	rebellion;
it	is	not	a	revolution.
I	want	my	buddhas	 to	 be	 rebellions.	But	 you	 can	 be	 a	 rebel	 only	 if	 you	 don't
depend	on	the	society.	If	you	are	independent	in	your	working,	in	your	earning,
you	can	be	rebellious	against	all	orthodoxies.
It	is	very	cunning,	but	perhaps	without	any	intention,	that	rich	people,	emperors,
all	donate	to	the	monasteries.	It	is	very	good	for	them:	they	are	earning	spiritual
virtue,	opening	a	bank	account	in	heaven.	And	on	the	other	end,	they	are	keeping
those	 people	 from	 ever	 becoming	 rebellious.	 They	 have	 crippled	 them
completely;	 they	have	 forgotten	how	 to	do	anything.	They	are	not	asked	 to	do
anything	but	just	sit	and	meditate	on	the	koan	--	which	is	an	absurdity.
It	 is	 by	 chance	 --	 and	 I	 will	 say	 only	 by	 chance	 --	 that	 someone	 becomes
enlightened	through	a	koan,	because	one	has	to	keep	repeating	it	for	at	least	two
or	three	years,	constantly	involved	in	it.
Remember	the	difference,	that	going	out	of	the	mind	is	not	going	beyond	mind.
Going	out	of	the	mind	is	very	easy.	Many	people	go	mad	without	any	koans,	but
perhaps	they	have	also	a	certain	koan	of	their	own.	Maybe	it	is	money,	maybe	it
is	a	woman	or	a	man.
They	drive	themselves	mad,	continuously	thinking	about	it.
I	 know	a	man	who	drove	himself	mad	because	of	money.	He	was	 so	much	 in
love	 with	 money	 that	 it	 was	 almost	 impossible	 to	 believe	 it.	 If	 you	 had	 a
hundred-rupee	note	in	your	hand,	it	is	yours	but	he	would	touch	it,	just	to	feel	it.
And	you	could	even	see	his	saliva	coming	out!
I	became	friendly	with	the	fellow,	so	he	used	to	come	to	my	place	and	I	would
give	him	a	 few	notes	 just	 to	play	with.	He	would	be	so	happy.	Finally	 I	heard
that	he	had	been	forced	into	a	madhouse,	because	it	became	a	difficult	situation.
He	 started	 stealing,	he	 started	borrowing	and	would	never	 repay,	 so	 the	whole
city	 became	 aware.	And	 he	would	 never	 purchase	 anything	 because	 he	would
have	to	give	up	the	money.
Money	was	his	god	--	it	is	many	people's	god,	it	is	their	koan.	It	is	also	just	like	a
koan,	 insoluble:	however	much	you	have,	your	desire	 is	always	 for	more.	 It	 is
insoluble.	Even	the	richest	man	in	the	world	is	not	satisfied	with	his	riches,	he
wants	more.
IN	CONCENTRATION	ON	A	KOAN,	THERE	IS	A	TIME	OF	ROUSING	THE
SPIRIT
OF	INQUIRY,	THERE	IS	A	TIME	OF	BREAKING	THE	CLINGING
ATTACHMENTS,	THERE	IS	A	TIME	OF	FURIOUS	DASHING	FORWARD,
AND
THERE	 IS	 A	 TIME	 OF	 DAMPING	 THE	 FUEL	 AND	 STOPPING	 THE
BOILING.
SINCE	 COMING	 TO	 JAPAN,	 THIS	 MOUNTAIN	 PRIEST	 HAS	 BEEN
MAKING	THE
PUPILS	LOOK	INTO	A	KOAN,	BUT	WHEN	THEY	HAVE	DONE	THIS	FOR
A	GOOD	TIME,	HE	TELLS	THEM	TO	THROW	IT	DOWN.	THE	POINT	IS
THAT
MANY	 PEOPLE	 COME	 TO	 SUCCESS	 IF	 THEY	 FIRST	 HAVE	 THE
EXPERIENCE
OF	WRESTLING	WITH	A	KOAN	AND	LATER	REDUCE	THE	EFFORT...
That's	why	I	say	Bukko	is	a	very	practical	and	pragmatic	teacher.	He	is	not	like	a
Bodhidharma,	 a	 sword	 --	 in	 one	 blow	 your	 head	 is	 gone.	 He	 is	 more
businesslike.	He	says	that	even	if	you	have	not	attained	satori,	enlightenment,	it
helps	just	to	get	hot.	If	it	is	not	enough	to	evaporate,	he	starts	telling	you,	"Cool
down,	drop	it."	His	experience	is	that	even	this	little	bit	of	heating	up,	and	then
cooling	down,	gives	a	certain	space,	a	gap,	a	comparison	between	the	two	states.
And	 through	 that	 gate,	 through	 that	 small	 acquaintance	 with	 the	 difference
between	 the	 heated	 mind	 and	 the	 cool	 mind,	 a	 person	 may	 come	 to	 success
rather	than	at	the	time	when	he	was	putting	out	exceptional	effort.
But	 this	 is,	 in	 my	 understanding,	 a	 very	 businesslike	 approach.	 Perhaps
somebody	may	have	attained	enlightenment	 in	 this	way,	but	 I	will	not	say	 that
this	is	a	principle;	it	can	only	be	an	accident.
I	 don't	 use	 koans	 at	 all,	 because	 my	 people	 are	 to	 put	 their	 totality	 into
meditation	for	five	minutes,	and	that's	enough.	Then	just	the	remembrance	of	it
will	transform	their	lives.
And	going	inwards	just	for	a	few	minutes	has	never	driven	anyone	mad.	You	can
go	as	deep	as	possible,	with	your	totality,	because	you	know	Nivedano	is	sitting
there	 and	 he	won't	 allow	 you	 to	 go	 beyond	 the	 limit.	 Just	 as	 you	 are	 coming
close	to	the	limit,	where	you	can	lose	your	mind,	Nivedano's	drum	immediately
calls	you	back.
We	are	not	to	lose	the	mind;	we	have	to	go	beyond	the	mind,	and	use	the	mind
from	the	space	of	being	beyond.	Mind	is	a	good	mechanism;	we	are	not	against
the	mind.	We	simply	don't	want	the	mind	to	be	dominant,	to	be	the	master.	We
want	our	consciousness	to	be	the	master	and	mind	only	a	functionary,	a	servant.
Bukko	 says,	 SO	 THE	 INSTRUCTION	 IS	 THAT	 THOSE	WHO	HAVE	NOT
YET
LOOKED	INTO	A	KOAN	ABSOLUTELY	MUST	DO	SO,	BUT	THOSE	WHO
HAVE
HAD	ONE	FOR	A	GOOD	TIME	MUST	THROW	IT	DOWN.	AT	THE	TIME
OF
ZAZEN	THEY	THROW	IT	ALL	AWAY.	THEY	SLEEP	WHEN	IT	IS	TIME	TO
SLEEP,	GO	WHEN	IT	IS	TIME	TO	GO,	SIT	WHEN	IT	IS	TIME	TO	SIT,	AND
SO
ON,	AS	IF	THEY	WERE	NOT	DOING	ZEN	AT	ALL.
This	part	 in	 itself	 is	beautiful.	This	part	can	be	of	 immense	help	to	you.	While
you	are	doing	your	meditations,	do	them	totally.	Forget	the	whole	world,	as	if	for
those	 few	 minutes	 there	 is	 no	 world;	 only	 you	 and	 this	 space	 that	 you	 are
running	 towards	 with	 the	 speed	 of	 light,	 like	 an	 arrow,	 to	 hit	 some	 unknown
center	of	your	being.
And	just	gather	the	experience,	 the	joy,	 the	blissfulness,	and	come	back.	Come
back	with	 your	 buddhahood	 as	 a	 fragrance	 around	 you.	And	 then	watch	 --	 in
your	day-to-day	life,	working,	all	kinds	of	things	--	just	out	of	the	corner	of	your
eye,	remember.	You	may	be	chopping	wood,	or	carrying	water	from	the	well	--
you	are	a	buddha.	Although	nobody	has	 seen	Gautam	Buddha	chopping	wood
and	 carrying	 water	 from	 the	 well	 --	 so	 many	 disciples	 loved	 him	 that	 they
managed	to	chop	the	wood	for	him	and	carry	the	water	from	the	well.
Before	you	gather	a	 few	buddhas	around	you,	you	have	 to	chop	 the	wood	and
you	have	to	carry	the	water.	But	don't	forget	that	you	are	a	buddha.	It	is	a	good
opportunity,	before	other	buddhas	start	chopping	your	wood!
This	last	statement	is	beautiful:
Be	a	buddha,	but	don't	be	an	exhibitionist.	Don't	try	to	convince	others	that	you
are	a	buddha	--	that's	what	mad	people	do.	It	is	enough	that	you	know	you	are	a
buddha.	You	don't	have	to	convince	the	neighbors	that	you	are	really	a	buddha.
I	used	to	go	to	madhouses....
One	of	my	friends	was	the	governor	of	one	of	the	states,	so	he	allowed	me	--	I
could	 visit	 any	 madhouse	 in	 the	 state,	 or	 any	 jail,	 wherever	 I	 wanted	 to	 go.
Otherwise,	it	is	very	difficult	to	see	mad	people.
You	cannot	change	their	opinion,	whatever	opinion	they	have.	If	they	think	that
they	are	a	railway	train,	they	will	go	by	your	side	making	the	noise	of	the	train.
They	will	 not	 bother	 that	 you	 are	 standing	 there...	 they	 are	 going	 somewhere.
They	are	a	train	and	you	cannot	convince	them	otherwise.
I	asked	a	madman	who	was	going	like	this,	"Do	you	have	any	passengers?"
He	said,	"I	am	 just	an	engine	and	I'm	shunting.	 I	am	not	going	anywhere,	 just
shunting	 from	 this	 room	 to	 that	 room.	 I	 am	only	 an	 engine,	 I	 don't	 care	 about
passengers!"
And	he	was	so	serious.	I	said,	"It	would	be	good	to	connect	a	train	with	you."
He	 said,	 "I	 don't	 like	 the	 idea.	Why	 should	 I	 bother	with	 any	 passengers	 and
trains?	I	am	enjoying	myself	perfectly."	And	he	went	on.
The	superintendent	said,	"We	have	tried.	It	doesn't	work	--	nothing	works."
You	cannot	change	the	mind	of	a	madman.	And	I	am	making	this	statement	for	a
particular	reason:	don't	have	such	a	mind,	which	cannot	be	changed.	That's	what
fundamentalists	 have	 --	 fundamentalist	 Christians	 like	 Ronald	 Reagan.	 You
cannot	change	their	minds,	and	that	is	a	sign	of	madness.	An	intelligent	man	is
always	 available	 to	 change,	 if	 a	 better	 argument	 is	 given	 to	 him.	 You	 cannot
change	the	fundamentalist;	he	has	decided,	and	decided	for	eternity.
There	 is	 no	 way	 to	 convince	 even	 Jesus	 that	 "You	 are	 not	 the	 son	 of	 God."
Thousands	 of	 people	 tried	 it:	 "Listen,	 don't	 make	 unnecessary	 fuss!	 And	 you
look	like	a	clown,	sitting	on	a	donkey,	followed	by	a	few	idiots	and	claiming	that
you	are	the	only	begotten	son	of	God.	You	are	a	humiliation	to	our	religion!"
The	 Jews	 were	 trying	 hard	 to	 convince	 him	 --	 "You	 are	 just	 a	 carpenter,
remember?	Your	father	is	Joseph	and	your	mother	is	Mary,	remember?"
But	a	fundamentalist....
In	 a	 crowd,	 Jesus	was	 speaking	 and	 somebody	 said,	 "Your	mother	 is	 standing
outside."
And	 it	 hurts	 what	 he	 said;	 he	 said,	 "Tell	 that	 woman	 that	 I	 don't	 have	 any
relatives	here!
My	father	is	in	heaven."
Now	 telling	 that	 poor	 woman	 --	 she	 had	 not	 seen	 him	 for	 years,	 because	 for
years	he	had	been	wandering	in	Kashmir,	in	Ladakh,	in	Tibet.	In	the	Bible	there
is	no	account	about	what	happened	for	seventeen	years	of	his	life.	And	he	lived
only	thirty-three	years;	only	three	years,	the	last	three	years,	are	depicted.	What
happened	to	the	seventeen	years	before?	One	mention	of	the	time	when	he	was
thirteen	is	there,	and	after	that	there	is	a	big	gap.
The	mother	had	not	seen	him	for	so	long,	naturally	the	poor	old	woman...	And
he	insulted	her,	he	did	not	even	give	her	an	appointment.	He	is	no	ordinary	man,
these	relatives	drag	him	down	to	humanity.	He	is	a	son	of	God,	he	is	divine,	he	is
not	human.
You	cannot	change	the	mind	of	a	fundamentalist.	And	to	me,	the	fundamentalist
is	 equivalent	 to	 the	 madman.	 A	 reasonable	 man,	 an	 intelligent	 man,	 is	 never
fundamentalist.
He	 is	 always	 ready	 and	 available	 to	 change	 anything	 if	 he	 can	 find	 a	 better
argument,	a	better	 idea,	a	better	solution.	He	is	flexible,	he	 is	not	adamant	and
stubborn.	He	is	ready	to	bend,	to	change,	to	transform.
I	 want	 you	 never	 to	 be	 a	 fundamentalist.	 Always	 remain	 vulnerable.	 To	 be
vulnerable	to	existence	is	the	most	beautiful	experience.
But	 for	 that,	 you	 need	 some	 acquaintance	 with	 existence	 --	 from	 your	 inner
being,	not	from	outside.	You	know	the	stars	from	the	outside,	but	you	have	not
known	the	universe	from	your	inside.	From	your	very	roots	you	have	to	come	in
contact,	 and	 that	contact	will	be	your	 liberation.	That	contact	will	make	you	a
buddha.
You	are	a	buddha;	just	a	little	dust	has	gathered	on	the	mirror.
I	am	reminded	of	Michelangelo....	He	passed	through	the	market	where	marble
shops	were.	And	he	was	a	sculptor,	perhaps	 the	best	 the	world	has	known.	He
saw	in	front	of	a	shop,	on	the	other	side	of	the	road,	a	big	marble	rock.	He	asked,
"How	much	will	it	cost?"
The	owner	said,	"It	will	not	cost	anything,	because	for	ten	years	it	has	been	lying
there	and	I	have	not	found	anybody	to	be	interested	in	it.	If	you	want	it	you	can
take	 it	 --	 I	 need	more	 space	 for	 other	 rocks	 and	 that	 rock	 is	 taking	 too	much
space.	But	I	don't	think	anybody	can	make	anything	out	of	it.	It	is	a	strange	rock,
the	shape	is	strange."
So	Michelangelo	took	that	rock,	and	after	two	years	working	on	it	he	created	the
world's	most	famous	statue	of	Jesus	--	he	has	just	been	brought	down	from	the
cross	and	Mary,	his	mother,	is	holding	him	in	her	lap.	The	statue	is	of	the	cross
and	Jesus	and	the	mother,	and	life	size.
Michelangelo	 was	 certainly	 one	 of	 the	 greatest	 men	 as	 far	 as	 sculpture	 is
concerned.	Jesus	looks	as	if	he	is	just	going	to	come	back	to	life	--	so	alive.	You
can	 see	 every	muscle	 of	 the	man,	 you	 can	 see	 the	 holes	which	 the	 nails	 have
made	in	his	hands....
Just	a	few	years	ago,	a	madman	destroyed	that	statue.	Nobody	ever	thought	that
anybody	would	destroy	such	a	beautiful	statue	--	 it	was	 in	 the	Vatican.	And	 in
front	of	the	court	the	madman	said,	"I	had	to	destroy	it	because	I	want	to	be	as
famous	as	Michelangelo.
Now	my	name	will	always	be	remembered	along	with	Michelangelo:	he	made	it,
I	destroyed	it."
But	when	the	statue	was	ready,	Michelangelo	invited	the	shop	owner	to	see	what
had	happened	to	the	rock.	The	shop	owner	could	not	believe	his	eyes.	He	said,
"You	have	done	a	miracle!	How	have	you	managed?"
Michelangelo	 said,	 "No,	 I	 have	 not	 managed	 anything.	 Just	 as	 I	 was	 passing
down	the	road,	I	heard	the	rock	saying,	`Hidden	in	me	are	Jesus	and	Mary.	You
just	have	to	take	out	a	few	chunks	here	and	there,	and	Jesus	and	Mary	will	reveal
themselves.'	 I	 have	 not	 created	 Jesus	 or	 Mary,	 I	 have	 simply	 removed	 the
unnecessary	marble	and	left	only	what	is	needed	to	make	Jesus	and	Mary	and	the
cross."
This	is	really	the	experience	of	a	meditator.	As	you	go	deeper	you	hear...	not	in
words,	 but	 something	 more	 like	 a	 magnetic	 pull,	 towards	 a	 buddha	 which	 is
hidden	 inside	you	at	 the	very	 source.	And	once	you	have	 touched	 those	 roots,
once	you	have	known	your	buddhahood	just	for	five	minutes,	it	is	enough	to	be
able	to	remember	it	twenty-four	hours.	Slowly	slowly	it	will	change	your	whole
life	into	a	beauty,	a	grace,	a	tremendous	ecstasy.
You	don't	have	to	do	meditation	twenty-four	hours.	I	am	against	monasteries	and
monks	 because	 they	 are	 an	 absolutely	 unnecessary	 load	 on	 the	 society.	 And
particularly	in	the	East,	where	there	is	so	much	poverty,	these	monks	are	heavy
on	the	whole	economy.
In	Thailand,	 just	 two	 years	 ago,	 they	 had	 to	 pass	 a	 law	 in	 the	 parliament	 that
nobody	 can	 become	 a	 monk	 without	 getting	 a	 license	 from	 the	 government.
Because	one	person	out	of	every	four	was	a	monk.	The	other	three	had	to	supply
everything	to	the	monk.	It	was	a	tradition	that	every	family	should	give	one	son,
particularly	the	eldest	son,	to	the	religion,	to	the	church.	They	were	one	fourth	of
the	population;	the	whole	population	is	poor,	and	these	vagabonds,	thinking	that
they	were	doing	something	spiritual,	were	just	being	parasites.
I	don't	want	anybody	 to	be	a	monk,	 I	want	you	 to	be	 in	 the	world.	Meditation
need	not	to	be	done	twenty-four	hours;	meditation	is	just	a	small	glimpse	--	and
then	carry	out	your	work.	Slowly	slowly	that	glimpse	will	start	radiating	in	your
actions,	in	your	silences,	in	your	songs,	in	your	dances.
There	is	no	need	to	waste	twenty-four	hours	and	become	a	parasite.	And	when
you	become	a	parasite	on	the	society,	you	cannot	rebel	against	the	society.	You
cannot	say	a	single	thing	against	any	superstition.
My	people	can	be	sannyasins	and	yet	absolutely	rebellious,	because	they	are	not
dependent	on	anyone.	Their	meditation	is	their	own	personal	affair.
Why	are	all	 the	 religions	against	me?	Because	I	am	introducing	a	new	kind	of
sannyasin	 in	 the	 world;	 and	 the	 fear	 is	 that	 if	 this	 fire	 catches	 hold,	 like	 a
wildfire,	 then	sannyasins	will	be	the	most	rebellious	people	 in	 the	world.	They
will	 destroy	 all	 superstitions	 and	 all	 stupidities,	 and	 they	 will	 not	 agree	 to
anything	that	goes	against	their	consciousness.
This	 is	 the	 reason	 that	 twenty-one	 countries	 have	 decided	 in	 their	 parliaments
that	 I	 am	 a	 dangerous	man.	And	 strangely	 enough,	 not	 a	 single	man	 in	 those
parliaments	has	asked,
"What	do	you	mean	by	dangerous?"	Everybody	understands,	 it	 seems,	 that	 the
danger	 is	 in	 giving	 individuality	 to	 religion,	 is	 in	 giving	 rebelliousness	 to
individuals.	And	no	vested	interest	wants	it.	They	are	ready	for	monks,	they	are
ready	to	give	donations	to	monasteries,	but	they	are	really	afraid	of	people	who
are	buddhas	and	 rebellious	 at	 the	 same	 time.	And	 to	me,	 a	buddha	who	 is	not
rebellious	is	not	much	of	a	buddha.	He	is	just	a	rotten	piece!
A	poet	wrote:
IN	THE	EVENING
IF	IT	WERE	RAIN
WE	SHOULD	SEEK	SHELTER,
BUT	THINKING,	"IT	IS	ONLY	MIST"
WE	GO	ON	AND	BECOME	DRENCHED.
He	is	not	talking	about	the	rain	outside,	he	is	talking	about	your	inside.	Don't	be
afraid	--
get	drenched	in	the	mist,	in	the	mystery.	And	when	you	come	back,	come	back	a
totally	different	person.	The	one	who	has	gone	in	should	be	left	behind,	and	you
should	take	a	new	face	--	your	original	face.
Dropping	the	mask	and	bringing	out	your	original	face	is	the	whole	alchemy	of
meditation.
An	 old	 man	 for	 the	 first	 time	 had	 come	 to	 a	 big	 city,	 and	 he	 was	 standing
amazed,	looking	at	the	high	skyscrapers.	And	then	he	saw	an	old	woman,	a	very
old	woman,	entering	into	a	cabin.	He	did	not	understand	that	it	was	an	elevator.
He	watched	to	see	what	happened,	and	when	the	elevator	came	down,	a	young
woman	came	out.
He	said,	"My	god!	 If	 I	had	known,	 I	would	have	brought	my	old	woman	with
me.	This	is	great	science!"
But	exactly	this	happens.	When	you	go	in,	you	are	an	old	mask;	when	you	come
back,	 come	 back	 as	 a	 fresh,	 original	 face.	 This	 everyday	 experience,	 slowly
slowly,	will	become	your	twenty-four-hour	silent	experience.	There	is	no	need	to
say	 to	 anybody	 that	 you	 are	 a	 buddha;	 they	 themselves	 will	 understand.	 You
cannot	hide	a	fire;	you	cannot	hide	a	buddha	either.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
THIS	UNSPEAKABLE	THAT	YOU	ARE	TRYING	TO	COMMUNICATE	TO
US,	 THIS	 UNGRASPABLE	 THAT	 WE	 ARE	 TRYING	 TO	 GET	 --
SOMETIMES	IT
SEEMS	PROFOUNDLY	MYSTERIOUS,	SOMETIMES	IT	SEEMS
EMBARRASSINGLY	OBVIOUS.	IS	IT	EITHER	OF	THESE	--	OR	BOTH
TOGETHER?
Maneesha,	it	is	both	together.
From	one	standpoint	it	is	obvious.	For	those	who	know,	it	is	obvious.	For	those
who	don't	know,	it	is	very	mysterious.	But	it	is	the	same	thing.	Our	effort	is	to
move	 from	 the	 point	 of	 obviousness	 to	 the	 point	 of	 mysteriousness...	 turning
your	 simplicity	 into	 innocence;	 bringing	 back	 your	 childhood	 fragrance	 and
freshness.
Buddha	is	not	a	foreigner;	buddha	is	your	innermost	core	--	where	nobody	else
has	 been	 able	 to	 reach;	 otherwise	 they	would	 have	 changed	 its	 face.	 It	 is	 the
place	where	only	you	can	go	--	 that's	why	it	has	remained	original.	Otherwise,
society	would	have	colored	it,	managed	it	in	such	a	way	that	it	becomes	useful
and	purposeful	for	the	society.	But	nobody	can	reach	within	you	except	you.
And	certainly	when	you	know	your	mysterious	existence,	you	don't	want	to	be
anyone	else.	You	have	come	to	the	point	where	the	whole	cosmos	welcomes	you
home.
(A	 FLASH	 OF	 LIGHTNING	 STREAKS	 THROUGH	 THE	 DARKNESS
OUTSIDE
THE	 HALL,	 FOLLOWED	 BY	 THUNDER	 AND	 A	 STEADY,	 GENTLE
RAIN.)	 Now	 the	 clouds	 have	 come...	 As	 long	 as	 you	 are	 going	 to	 laugh,	 the
clouds	are	going	to	come	to	listen.	They	come	at	the	right	moment.
Dogski	 staggers	 home	 late	 one	 night	 after	 drinking	 about	 a	 thousand	 beers.
When	he	comes	into	the	bedroom,	he	discovers	his	wife	lying	half-naked	on	the
bed,	and	a	strange	man	in	the	act	of	removing	his	pants.
"For	the	last	time,	lady,"	says	the	man,	thinking	furiously,	"if	you	don't	pay	your
gas	bill	right	now,	I'll	shit	on	the	floor!"
Max	Muldoon	gets	drafted	 to	 fight	 in	Ronald	Reagan's	new	war	 in	 the	Middle
East,	 and	he	 does	 not	 like	 the	 idea	 at	 all.	He	does	 everything	he	 can	 to	 avoid
being	 in	 the	 army,	 but	 somehow	 finds	 himself	 in	 General	 Grimguts'	 Marine
platoon.
One	day,	Max	is	in	the	front	line	of	battle.	The	noise	is	terrifying	as	bullets	and
bombs	fly	all	around	him.	Max	looks	up	in	horror	and	then	throws	down	his	gun.
"I	have	had	enough!"	he	shouts,	and	he	starts	running	away	from	the	front	lines.
Many	people	try	to	stop	him	as	he	runs,	but	Max	pays	no	attention	to	them.	He
runs	and	runs	until	he	bumps	right	into	General	Grimguts	himself.
"Stop!"	roars	Grimguts.
"What	for?"	shouts	back	Max.
"I	 am	 ordering	 you	 to	 stop!"	 shouts	 the	 General.	 "I	 am	 your	 commanding
officer!"
"My	god!"	replies	Max,	quite	surprised.	"Am	I	that	far	back	already?"
Sixteen-year-old	 Sally	 tiptoes	 into	 the	 confession	 box	 in	 the	 Holy	 Martyred
Virgins'
Church,	where	Father	Fumble	is	sitting.
"Father,"	whispers	Sally,	"I	have	sinned!"
"Tell	me	all	about	it!"	replies	the	young	priest.
"Well,	 Father,"	 continues	 Sally,	 "my	 boyfriend	Willy	 came	 home	with	me	 the
other	day,	and	I	took	him	to	my	room."
"Really?"	says	Father	Fumble.	"And	what	happened	in	there?"
"Well,	Father,"	continues	Sally,	"Willy	pushed	me	back	onto	the	bed	and	started
taking	my	clothes	off."
"Really?"	says	Father	Fumble.	"And	what	happened	next?"
"Then	Willy	took	off	his	clothes	and	jumped	on	top	of	me!"	sobs	Sally.
"Ahem!"	 coughs	Fumble,	 clearing	 his	 throat.	 "And	 tell	me,	my	 child,	 did	 you
feel	his	organ	coming	between	your	legs?"
"I'm	not	a	musician,"	replies	Sally,	"but	I	would	say	it	felt	more	like	a	flute!"
Nivedano...
Nivedano...
Be	silent...	close	your	eyes.	Feel	your	body	to	be	frozen.
Look	inwards	with	your	totality,
straight	ahead.
Just	a	little	more
and	you	will	be	encountering	your	real	self.
It	is	raining	outside,	but	inside
it	is	only	mist.
Get	drenched	in	it.
Drop	your	mask,	and	when	you	come	back,
come	back	with	your	original	face.
Your	original	face	is	the	buddha.
To	get	hold	of	it	totally...	Nivedano...
Relax...	 just	watch	 the	body	and	 the	mind,	and	remember	you	are	neither.	You
are	the	watcher.
This	 already	 beautiful	 evening	 becomes	 more	 ecstatic	 by	 your	 watching.	 Just
watching,	you	will	feel	utter	emptiness.
The	emptiness	is	the	name	of	buddha	himself.
This	silence...
you	have	all	become	one	in	an	oceanic	consciousness.
Boundaries	are	lost,
limits	are	forgotten...
Collect	this	experience,	because	you	have	to	carry	it	twenty-four	hours	--	in	all
your	actions	and	gestures,	words	and	silences.
Nivedano...
Come	back,	but	come	back
with	your	original	face.
Silent,	peaceful,	graceful	--	a	buddha.
Sit	like	a	buddha	for	a	few	seconds,	and	remember	it	twenty-four	hours.
It	is	not	an	achievement,	it	is	just	a	remembrance	of	your	forgotten	self.
It	is	obvious,	but	it	is	mysterious	also.
Okay	Maneesha?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.
Can	we	celebrate	the	gathering	of	the	ten	thousand	buddhas?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.

OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
SHOITSU	SAID	TO	CHIZEN:
IN	 THE	 SCHOOL	 OF	 THE	 ANCESTRAL	 TEACHERS,	 WE	 POINT
DIRECTLY	TO
THE	 HUMAN	 MIND.	 VERBAL	 EXPLANATIONS	 AND	 ILLUSTRATIVE
DEVICES
ACTUALLY	MISS	THE	POINT.
NOT	FALLING	INTO	SEEING	AND	HEARING,	NOT	FOLLOWING	SOUND
OR
FORM,	ACTING	FREELY	IN	THE	PHENOMENAL	WORLD,	SITTING	AND
LYING
IN	 THE	 HEAP	 OF	 MYRIAD	 FORMS,	 NOT	 INVOLVED	 WITH
PHENOMENA	IN
BREATHING	OUT,	 NOT	 BOUND	 TO	 THE	 CLUSTERS	AND	 ELEMENTS
OF
EXISTENCE	IN	BREATHING	IN,	THE	WHOLE	WORLD	IS	THE	GATE	OF
LIBERATION.	ALL	WORLDS	ARE	TRUE	REALITY.
A	UNIVERSAL	MASTER	KNOWS	WHAT	IT	COMES	TO,	THE	MOMENT
IT	IS
RAISED.	HOW	WILL	BEGINNERS	AND	LATECOMERS	COME	TO	GRIPS
WITH
IT?
IF	 YOU	 DON'T	 GET	 IT	 YET,	 FOR	 THE	 TIME	 BEING	 WE	 OPEN	 UP	 A
PATHWAY
IN	THE	GATEWAY	OF	THE	SECONDARY	TRUTH.	SPEAK	OUT	WHERE
THERE
IS	 NOTHING	 TO	 SAY;	 MANIFEST	 FORM	 IN	 THE	 MIDST	 OF
FORMLESSNESS.
DURING	 YOUR	 DAILY	 ACTIVITIES	 RESPONDING	 TO
CIRCUMSTANCES	IN
THE	REALM	OF	DISTINCTIONS,	DON'T	THINK	OF	GETTING	RID	OF
ANYTHING.	DON'T	UNDERSTAND	IT	AS	A	HIDDEN	MARVEL	--	WITH
NO
ROAD	 OF	 REASON,	 NO	 FLAVOR,	 DAY	 AND	 NIGHT,	 FORGETTING
SLEEP	AND
FOOD,	KEEP	THOSE	SAYINGS	IN	MIND.
IF	YOU	STILL	DON'T	GET	IT,	WE	GO	ON	TO	SPEAK	OF	THE	TERTIARY,
EXPOUNDING	 MIND	 AND	 NATURE,	 SPEAKING	 OF	 MYSTERY	 AND
MARVEL.
ONE	ATOM	CONTAINS	THE	COSMOS,	ONE	THOUGHT	PERVADES
EVERYWHERE.	THUS	AN	ANCIENT	SAID:
"INFINITE	LANDS	AND	WORLDS	WITH	NO	DISTINCTIONS	BETWEEN
SELF
AND	 OTHERS,	 TEN	 AGES	 PAST	 AND	 PRESENT	 ARE	 NEVER	 APART
FROM
THIS	MOMENT	OF	THOUGHT."
Maneesha,	 the	whole	point	of	Zen,	its	whole	philosophy,	its	whole	theology,	is
contained	 in	 the	 present	 moment.	 If	 you	 can	 stay	 in	 the	 present	 moment,	 the
doors	of	wisdom	will	open	on	their	own.	In	a	thousand	ways	the	same	thing	has
been	 said,	 again	 and	 again:	 This	 moment	 contains	 everything	 --	 the	 whole
universe	--	past,	present	and	future.	This	moment	is	all.	If	we	can	enter	into	this
moment's	 reality,	we	will	 be	 entering	 the	very	 center	 of	 the	universe,	 the	very
source	of	life.
Zen's	interest	is	not	in	gods,	not	in	paradises.	Its	interest	is	absolutely	life,	known
in	its	eternity,	with	all	its	joys	and	celebrations.	It	is	a	religion	of	celebration.	It	is
not	 sad,	 serious.	Because	 it	 is	not	going	 to	achieve	anything,	 it	 cannot	 fail.	 Its
victory	 is	 absolutely	 certain	 because	what	 it	 is	 seeking	 is	 already	 there	within
you.	 It	 is	 everybody's	 life	 source.	Combined,	 it	 becomes	 the	 life	 source	of	 the
whole	universe.	We	are	just	small	branches	coming	out	of	the	universal	source.
The	 moment	 you	 realize	 your	 universality,	 all	 your	 anxieties	 appear	 to	 be	 so
trivial,	so	tiny...	just	the	very	realization	of	your	eternity	makes	them	disappear,
they	become	shadows.	The	moment	you	realize	your	life	source,	they	lose	their
reality.	In	other	words	your	anxieties,	your	problems	and	your	anguish	are	real	if
you	don't	know	yourself.	That	is	your	life,	if	you	don't	know	your	life	source.
What	has	come	to	be	known	as	existentialism	in	 the	West	must	have	preceded
Gautam	 Buddha	 in	 the	 East.	 Existentialism	 says	 life	 is	 nothing	 but	 anguish,
anxiety,	angst;	 it	has	no	meaning.	There	 is	only	 failure;	 that	 is	your	destiny.	 It
gives	a	very	dark	color,	a	very	negative	approach,	to	existence.	Listening	to	the
modern	existentialists	one	can	only	feel	that	perhaps	suicide	is	the	only	way	out.
Life	in	every	possible	way	is	going	to	be	full	of	anxiety.
My	 own	 understanding	 is	 that	 before	 the	 time	 of	 Gautam	Buddha	 there	must
have	been	the	same	kind	of	feeling	in	the	East,	that	life	is	meaningless.	I	know
the	names	of	at	least	three	people	who	were	very	famous	in	those	days,	but	all
their	literature	has	been	destroyed	because	their	whole	point	of	view	was	against
life.	One	was	 Sanjay	Bilattiputta,	 another	was	Ajit	Keshkambal,	 and	 the	 third
was	Gosal.	These	 three	people	were	as	 intelligent	as	any	Gautam	Buddha.	But
they	preached	that	life	is	meaningless;	all	the	meaning	that	you	give	to	it	is	your
imagination.	It	is	just	a	hope	that	keeps	you	going	on,	through	all	the	sufferings,
through	all	the	meaningless	incidents.	And	from	the	cradle	to	the	grave,	you	will
not	find	a	single	place	where	you	can	rest.	It	is	just	restlessness.
But	 with	 Gautam	 Buddha,	 things	 took	 a	 different	 turn	 --	 a	 turn	 which	 is
enormous.	 The	 West	 needs	 a	 Gautam	 Buddha;	 otherwise	 the	 idea	 of
meaninglessness,	anxiety,	anguish,	 is	bound	to	create	 the	 idea	of	suicide	as	 the
way	out.	Gautam	Buddha	accepts	everything	that	existentialism	says,	but	he	says
life	is	meaningless	and	full	of	anxiety	because	you	have	not	gone	deep	enough
into	your	being.	On	the	surface	it	is	all	turmoil,	just	as	you	see	in	the	ocean:	on
the	surface	there	is	so	much	turmoil	but	in	the	depths	there	is	absolute	silence.
The	 deeper	 you	 go	 into	 the	 ocean,	 the	 more	 silent...	 absolute	 silence.	 And
attaining	the	absolute	silence	you	start	looking	at	things	with	different	eyes.	The
same	things	are	there,	the	world	is	the	same,	but	because	you	now	have	different
eyes,	 you	 start	 seeing	 in	 a	 different	 way.	 The	 same	 roseflower	 becomes	 so
beautiful	 that	 there	 is	 no	 need	 for	 it	 to	 have	 any	 purpose;	 just	 its	 beauty	 is
enough	unto	itself.	The	song	of	a	cuckoo	may	not	have	any	meaning	but	it	has	a
beauty,	a	grandeur	which	penetrates	to	the	very	heart.	And	if	the	heart	is	emptied
by	meditation,	 it	 gives	 you	 a	 glimpse	 of	 authentic	music,	 spontaneous	music.
Everything	 around	you	 starts	 taking	 a	 different	 shape,	 a	 different	 context.	The
only	change	that	is	needed	is	that	you	go	from	the	surface	to	the	center	of	your
being.
Now	this	point	is	very	important	to	understand,	because	a	few	have	escaped	the
surface	 by	 renouncing	 the	world.	 They	 think	 it	 is	 the	world	 that	 is	 creating	 a
disturbance,	it	is	the	world	that	is	responsible	for	our	anxieties.	That	has	been	the
traditional	 attitude	 of	 the	 sannyasin,	 of	 the	 monk.	 Just	 leave	 this	 world,	 hide
behind	a	monastery	or	behind	a	mountain,	just	to	attain	a	little	peace.
But	I	know	that	even	hiding	behind	a	mountain,	your	mind	will	be	the	same	as	it
was	in	 the	marketplace.	It	will	create	 troubles	and	anxieties	 there,	 too.	Perhaps
more	 than	ever,	because	 the	cold	winter	will	come	and	you	don't	have	enough
clothes,	the	hot	summer	will	come	and	you	don't	have	a	roof,	a	shelter.	And	from
where	are	you	going	to	get	your	food?	Again	you	will	have	to	come	by	the	back
door,	as	a	beggar,	to	the	same	marketplace	that	you	have	renounced.
All	 these	 so-called	 saints	who	 have	 renounced	 the	world	 have	 simply	 become
dependent	on	the	world,	parasites,	but	they	have	not	attained	any	new	vision.	So
the	way	that	takes	you	away	from	the	turmoil	is	not	the	right	way.	The	right	way
is	to	go	as	deep	into	the	turmoil	as	possible,	because	in	the	depths	there	are	no
waves,	there	is	no	turmoil.
My	sannyasin	is	not	to	renounce	anything	in	the	world.	Everything	is	beautiful.
If	it	does	not	appeal	to	you,	something	is	wrong	with	you.	Go	inside.	First	seek
and	search	the	source	of	your	being,	of	your	life.	Once	you	have	caught	the	roots
of	 your	 being,	 then	 come	 out	 and	 open	 your	 eyes	 and	 you	will	 see	 the	 same
world	but	with	a	new	color,	with	a	new	intensity,	with	a	new	love,	with	a	new
beauty.	The	same	world	is	no	more	the	same	because	you	are	no	more	the	same.
By	transforming	yourself	you	have	transformed	the	whole	world.
It	 is	 absolutely	 right	 when	 Gautam	 Buddha	 says,	 "The	 moment	 I	 became
enlightened	the	whole	world	became	enlightened.	Everything	appeared	to	me	to
be	a	buddha,	either	awake	or	asleep.	I	could	see,	even	in	the	flowers	or	grasses
or	stones,	buddhas	fast	asleep."
The	 whole	 of	 existence	 is	 by	 its	 very	 nature	 nothing	 but	 consciousness,	 and
consciousness	can	be	of	different	depths.	The	stone	may	be	very	fast	asleep.	You
cannot	wake	it,	but	that	does	not	mean	that	there	is	no	life	source	hidden	in	the
stone.	The	stone	grows.	The	Himalayas	are	growing	one	foot	 taller	every	year.
Just	stupid	fellows!
Already	they	are	the	tallest	mountains	in	the	world,	but	 the	same	stupidity	that
human	beings	have...	they	go	on	growing.
Some	 older	mountains	 in	 India	 --	 the	 oldest	mountain	 is	 Vindhyachal	 --	 have
stopped	growing	millions	of	years	ago.	Seeing	that	there	is	no	point...	what	are
you	going	to	do,	unnecessarily	growing	high?	Just	enjoy.	You	cannot	enjoy	while
you	 are	 involved	 in	 achieving	 something.	 When	 you	 are	 not	 involved	 in
achieving,	 when	 there	 is	 no	 desire	 to	 reach	 somewhere,	 you	 can	 enjoy	 the
moment,	here,	now.
Zen	 is	 the	 religion	 of	 here	 and	 now.	 Always	 remember	 this	 context	 in
whatsoever	statements	we	are	discussing.	It	is	a	totally	different	approach	from
that	of	other	religions.
Even	the	Buddhists	don't	accept	Zen,	because	Zen	has	such	rebelliousness,	such
independence	that	it	cannot	accept	any	authority	unless	it	is	the	authority	of	your
own	 experience.	Even	Buddhists	 think	 of	Zen	 as	 a	 little	 eccentric,	 outside	 the
mold,	not	belonging	to	the	vast	stream	of	Buddhism.
But	as	far	as	I	am	concerned,	 it	 is	 the	essence	of	Buddha's	very	heart.	Without
Zen,	Buddhism	is	as	dead	a	religion	as	any	other	religion.	It	 is	Zen	which	still
brings	 flowers,	 it	 is	 Zen	 which	 is	 still	 a	 garden;	 all	 the	 other	 religions	 have
become	 deserts.	 But	 why	 does	 it	 go	 on	 bringing	 flowers?	 Because	 its
dependence	 is	 not	 on	 scriptures,	 on	 tradition.	 Its	 very	world	 is	 limited	within
you,	and	if	you	change,	the	world	around	you	has	to	change	accordingly.
A	man	 like	Gautam	Buddha,	 just	by	being	awakened,	changes	 the	character	of
everything	around	him.	His	vision,	his	radiance,	his	presence...	at	least	for	him	it
is	a	different	world.
These	small	statements	by	Zen	masters	have	to	be	very	carefully	heard.	You	are
not	to	agree	or	disagree.	If	you	start	agreeing	or	disagreeing	you	miss	the	point.
Listen	silently	as	if	you	are	listening	to	the	sound	of	a	river,	or	the	sound	of	the
wind	blowing	through	the	pine	trees.	Just	hear	it,	without	bringing	your	mind	in
to	say,	"Yes,	it	is	right,"	or	"No,	it	is	not	right."
Any	statement	or	interpretation	by	your	mind	is	going	to	distort	the	whole	thing.
The	statement	 is	not	 linguistic.	It	 is	not	 the	 language,	 it	 is	something	invisible,
side	by	side	with	the	language,	that	is	being	transmitted.	So	if	you	silently	hear,
the	language	does	not	matter.	Your	silence	grows	deeper	--	 that's	what	matters.
What	the	language	was	saying	is	immaterial,	it	was	just	a	vehicle.
Just	a	few	days	ago	Anando	brought	me	the	news.	I	have	never	thought	about	it,
and	I	don't	think	anybody	has	ever	thought	about	it	--	they	have	just	discovered
that	electricity	does	not	run	in	the	wires	but	along	the	sides,	next	to	the	wire	--	a
fellow	traveler,	not	inside	the	wire.	It	takes	the	help	of	the	wire,	but	--	this	is	a
very	significant	discovery	--
the	electricity	is	not	in	the	wire	itself.
To	me,	 it	 takes	on	a	new	significance:	 the	words	of	 the	master	are	not	 the	real
message;	 the	words	 are	 just	 like	 the	wires	 for	 electricity.	Alongside	 the	wires
runs	 a	message	 invisible	 to	 the	 eyes,	 only	 able	 to	 be	 understood	 by	 an	 empty
heart.
Sit	silently,	in	utter	emptiness.	Your	agreement	or	disagreement	are	not	needed.
Just	 your	 silence	 deepening,	 your	 emptiness	 becoming	more	 and	more	 empty,
and	you	have	understood	without	even	bothering	about	the	words.	Those	words
were	all	arbitrary.
SHOITSU	SAID	TO	CHIZEN:
IN	 THE	 SCHOOL	 OF	 THE	 ANCESTRAL	 TEACHERS,	 WE	 POINT
DIRECTLY	TO
THE	 HUMAN	 MIND.	 VERBAL	 EXPLANATIONS	 AND	 ILLUSTRATIVE
DEVICES
ACTUALLY	MISS	THE	POINT.
The	question	 is,	 how	 to	 indicate	 to	you	 the	way	 to	your	own	heart.	Shoitsu	 is
saying	 that	 VERBAL	 EXPLANATIONS	 AND	 ILLUSTRATIVE	 DEVICES
ACTUALLY	MISS
THE	POINT	--	most	of	the	time.	Once	in	a	while,	a	person	has	understood	that	it
is	not	language	or	philosophy,	but	the	words	are	used	just	like	a	wire	and	running
alongside	is	a	life,	an	energy.	That	energy	can	be	absorbed	only	by	your	empty
heart.	If	the	heart	is	full	of	things,	too	much	furniture...	life	energy	will	not	enter
a	space	which	is	too	full.	It	enters	only	into	utter	emptiness.
Shoitsu	is	saying,	WE	POINT	DIRECTLY	TO	THE	HUMAN	MIND.
What	are	we	doing	here?	I	talk	with	you,	but	that	is	only	a	preparation	so	that	in
meditation	I	can	point	directly	to	your	heart.	A	certain	preparation	is	absolutely
needed	to	cut	away	all	garbage,	 to	 throw	out	all	 the	scriptures,	 to	expel	all	 the
ancient	 buddhas	 and	 siddhas,	 so	 that	 you	 are	 left	 absolutely	 alone.	 From	 that
point	meditation	can	start.	When	your	heart	is	utterly	empty,	it	is	not	difficult	to
point	to	the	source	of	your	being.
NOT	FALLING	INTO	SEEING	AND	HEARING,	NOT	FOLLOWING	SOUND

EXISTENCE	IN	BREATHING	IN,	THE	WHOLE	WORLD	IS	THE	GATE	OF
LIBERATION.	ALL	WORLDS	ARE	TRUE	REALITY.
If	you	have	concentrated	your	life	energy	in	the	empty	heart,	then	all	that	is	false
simply	disappears	and	only	the	real	remains.	Then	the	whole	world	is	real,	then
there	is	no	need	to	say	that	it	is	illusory.	It	has	been	said	to	be	illusory	by	those
escapists	 who	 wanted	 to	 run	 away	 from	 it.	 They	 needed	 some	 excuse.	 They
called	this	whole	world,	all	relationships,	everything,	illusory	--	just	like	dreams.
I	have	always	wondered...	I	have	met	with	many	escapist	saints	and	I	have	asked
them,
"If	you	really	see	that	this	world	is	illusory,	made	of	the	same	stuff	as	dreams	are
made	of,	why	are	you	escaping	from	it?	What	is	the	point?	According	to	you	the
world	does	not	exist.	You	are	renouncing	a	non-existential	world!"
If	 the	world	does	not	 exist,	 then	why	not	 enjoy	 it?	Have	good,	nice	dreams	 --
drop	nightmares!	Sort	things	out:	whatever	is	a	nightmare,	drop	it.
And	 that	 is	 what	 happens	 when	 a	 man	 reaches	 his	 center.	 That	 which	 is	 a
nightmare	--
and	your	whole	life	up	to	now	has	been	a	nightmare	--	simply	disappears.	And	a
tremendously	beautiful	world	arises	out	of	 the	ashes	of	 the	old	world	 that	you
used	to	know.	It	looks	the	same	but	because	your	vision	is	different,	it	is	not	the
same.
Not	 a	 single	 saint	 I	 have	 met	 --	 and	 I	 have	 been	 roaming	 around	 for	 almost
thirty-five	 years	 and	 I	 have	 met	 almost	 all	 kinds	 of	 saints,	 Hindu,	 Jaina,
Mohammedan,	Christian	--
not	 a	 single	 one	 has	 been	 able	 to	 answer	 a	 simple	 question:	 if	 the	 world	 is
illusory,	 then	it	does	not	matter,	 let	 it	be	there;	where	are	you	going?	Escaping
from	a	world	that	is	illusory	is	so	stupid	an	act.	If	the	world	is	real	there	is	some
point	in	escaping	from	it	if	you	don't	want	it.	But	it	is	illusory!	And	if	illusions
arise	out	of	your	mind,	then	wherever	you	go,	the	illusions	will	arise.
A	great	saint	was	dying	and	he	said	to	his	successor,	a	young	man,	"Remember
one	thing:	never	allow	a	cat	in	your	life,"	and	he	died.	A	big	crowd	had	gathered
to	 listen	 to	 the	 last	 statement	of	 this	great	 saint...	and	what	a	sentence!	"Never
allow	a	cat	in	your	life."	The	successor	said,	"My	god,	why	should	I	allow	a	cat
in	my	life	in	the	first	place?	And	this	is	the	whole	religion?"	But	an	old	man	--
who	was	also	a	disciple,	but	was	not	chosen	as	a	successor	because	he	was	too
old;	he	was	himself	going	to	die	within	a	year	or	two	--
said,	"You	don't	know,	there	is	a	long	story	behind	it.	He	has	just	given	you	the
punch	line."
He	said,	"Then	I	must	know	the	whole	story."
The	story	was	that	when	the	saint	renounced	his	wife	and	children	and	his	home
and	 went	 into	 the	 Himalayas,	 he	 lived	 near	 a	 small	 village.	 Otherwise,	 from
where	will	you	get	your	food?	But	the	villagers	were	happy	that	they	had	a	saint
of	their	own,	so	they	made	a	small	bamboo	cottage	for	him.
The	Indian	monks	used,	 in	place	of	underwear,	 just	a	 long	strip	of	cloth	called
langot.	It	is	a	"mini"	--	mini-est	--	because	just	a	long	strip...	they	wrap	it	around
themselves.	They	were	allowed	to	have	only	 two	langotis.	But	a	 trouble	arose:
some	rats	came	into	the	house	and	they	started	chewing	on	the	langot.	The	man
was	in	a	great	difficulty;	he	had	only	two	langotis	and	soon	they	would	be	gone.
So	he	asked	the	villagers,	"What	to	do?
because	my	sect	does	not	allow	a	saint	to	have	more	than	two	langotis.	That's	the
only	possession	allowed."
They	said,	"Why	don't	you	take	a	cat	from	the	village?	She	will	kill	the	rats."	It
was	a	perfectly	rational	solution.	So	the	villagers	gave	him	a	good	cat,	and	the
cat	killed	the	rats.	But	the	problem	was,	now	he	had	to	beg	for	his	food	and	the
cat	also	needed	something	 to	eat,	because	 the	 rats	were	 finished.	So	he	had	 to
beg	for	some	milk	for	the	cat.
The	villagers	said,	"This	is	a	small	village...	the	best	thing	for	us	is	that	you	have
a	cow.
The	whole	village	can	contribute	some	money	and	purchase	a	beautiful	cow,	and
in	 that	way	you	will	become	very	 independent.	You	can	have	enough	milk	 for
yourself	and	for	your	cat."
It	looked	right,	so	a	beautiful	cow	was	brought	in.	Now	the	problem	was	that	the
cow	needed	grass.	So	every	day	he	had	to	go	to	the	village	to	beg	for	the	grass.
People	said,
"This	does	not	look	right.	A	great	saint	asking	for	grass?	In	fact	no	saint	has	ever
asked	for	grass;	it	is	not	conventional."
He	said,	"But	what	to	do?	My	cow,	my	cat..."
So	 they	 said,	 "A	simple	 solution:	we	are	villagers,	we	don't	know	much	about
your	philosophy.	One	woman	has	become	a	widow;	her	husband	has	died,	and
she	has	nobody.
So	we	will	persuade	her.	She	will	be	really	happy	to	serve	a	saint	and	then	you
don't	have	to	come	every	day.	We	will	clear	some	ground	by	the	side	of	your	hut
so	 she	can	grow	grass,	 she	can	grow	wheat...	 and	 she	will	 take	care	of	you	 in
sickness,	in	illness."
The	idea	was	right	--	it	was	always	right.	It	was	not	much	effort	to	persuade	the
woman;	she	was	alone	and	the	saint	was	young...	there	was	a	possibility,	a	hope.
So	she	 immediately	agreed.	She	started	 taking	care,	and	you	know	how	things
grow....
Basho	 says,	 "The	 grass	 grows	 by	 itself."	 In	 fact	 many	 things	 grow	 by
themselves.	 So	 grass	 started	 growing,	 they	 fell	 in	 love...	 the	 woman	 was
beautiful,	the	saint	was	young.
What	more	is	needed?	They	worked	in	the	field,	they	started	growing	wheat	and
they	started	growing	grass.	The	cat	was	very	happy	and	the	cow	was	very	happy,
everything	was	perfect.	But	 then	 the	ultimate	 --	 children	 came	 in,	 and	 then	he
thought,	"My	god,	 that's	what	 I	had	 left	behind!	I	have	renounced	 the	world	--
this	is	the	whole	world	again!
It	grew	so	slowly	that	I	was	not	aware	until	the	children	came."
Now,	just	because	of	the	cat	the	whole	world	came	in.	The	old	man	said,	"That
was	the	punch	line.	He	told	you,	`Remember	not	to	allow	a	cat,'	because	behind
the	cat	the	whole	world	comes	in.	He	was	talking	about	his	own	life	story,	how
he	again	became	engaged	 in	 the	 same	world	 --	 taking	children	 to	 the	 school...
and	people	started	laughing	at	him:
`What	kind	of	saint	are	you?	You	are	keeping	a	woman!	You	have	fallen	down
from	your	greatness.'
"But	what	to	do	now?	Once	you	have	fallen,	you	have	fallen;	it	is	very	difficult
to	rise	again.	He	thought	many	times	to	renounce	again,	but	he	thought	--	what	is
the	point?
Those	 rats	 are	 everywhere.	 Again	 the	 same	 story	 will	 start.	 It	 is	 better	 to	 be
silent."
Your	mind,	your	body,	both	need	certain	things.	You	cannot	renounce	the	world,
you	can	only	become	a	beggar.	But	to	become	a	beggar	is	not	to	become	a	saint.
My	understanding	is	clear,	that	you	should	be	in	the	world.	There	is	nothing	to
be	afraid	of;	you	should	just	concentrate	your	life	energy	within	yourself	and	that
makes	 all	 the	 difference.	 You	 remain	 in	 the	world	 and	 yet	 you	 are	 not	 in	 the
world.	You	are	in	the	world	but	the	world	is	not	in	you.	And	to	me,	that	is	 the
true	definition	of	 a	 sannyasin:	 remaining	 in	 the	world,	 just	 like	a	 lotus	 flower,
remaining	in	the	water	but	untouched	by	it.
A	UNIVERSAL	MASTER	KNOWS	WHAT	IT	COMES	TO,	THE	MOMENT
IT	IS
RAISED.	HOW	WILL	BEGINNERS	AND	LATECOMERS	COME	TO	GRIPS
WITH
IT?
IF	 YOU	 DON'T	 GET	 IT	 YET,	 FOR	 THE	 TIME	 BEING	 WE	 OPEN	 UP	 A
PATHWAY
IN	THE	GATEWAY	OF	THE	SECONDARY	TRUTH.
I	don't	 agree	on	 that	point.	Shoitsu	 is	 saying	 that	 if	you	cannot	understand	 the
direct	pointing	 to	your	heart,	 then	we	have	 to	descend	a	 little	 lower	--	but	 that
will	be
"secondary	truth."	That	will	be	just	like	the	moon	reflected	in	water;	it	will	not
be	the	true	moon.	It	will	be	only	a	reflected	moon.	In	language,	truth	at	the	most
can	be	just	a	reflection.	So	he	is	saying	that	if	you	cannot	get	it	directly,	instantly,
then	we	will	have	to	come	down	to	language.
I	don't	 agree	with	 the	 statement	because	my	understanding	 is	 that	you	have	 to
begin	with	 language.	You	have	 to	begin	with	 the	 reflection	of	 the	moon	 in	 the
water.	And	if	you	have	seen	the	reflection	in	the	water	you	can	be	told	to	look	up
a	little:	"It	is	only	a	reflection;	the	reality	is	there	high	up	in	the	sky."	Language
is	 not	 a	 secondary	 thing	 to	 be	 used	when	 the	 first	 has	 failed.	Language	 is	 the
primary	thing,	 to	create	 the	background	for	pointing	directly	 to	your	innermost
heart.
SPEAK	OUT	WHERE	THERE	IS	NOTHING	TO	SAY;	MANIFEST	FORM	IN
THE
MIDST	OF	FORMLESSNESS.
DURING	 YOUR	 DAILY	 ACTIVITIES	 RESPONDING	 TO
CIRCUMSTANCES	IN
THE	REALM	OF	DISTINCTIONS,	DON'T	THINK	OF	GETTING	RID	OF
ANYTHING.
On	that	point	I	am	in	agreement	with	him.
...	 DON'T	 THINK	 OF	 GETTING	 RID	 OF	 ANYTHING.	 DON'T
UNDERSTAND	IT	AS
A	HIDDEN	MARVEL	--	WITH	NO	ROAD	OF	REASON,	NO	FLAVOR,	DAY
AND
NIGHT,	 FORGETTING	 SLEEP	 AND	 FOOD,	 KEEP	 THOSE	 SAYINGS	 IN
MIND.
IF	YOU	STILL	DON'T	GET	IT,	WE	GO	ON	TO	SPEAK	OF	THE	TERTIARY,
The	third	step,	if	you	don't	understand	the	language,	he	says	then	we	will	have	to
descend	 even	 a	 little	 lower.	 I	 think	 that	 I	 not	 only	disagree	with	him,	but	 it	 is
humiliating	to	the	disciples	to	say,	"We	will	have	to	speak	on	a	third	level."
...	EXPOUNDING	MIND	AND	NATURE,	SPEAKING	OF	MYSTERY	AND
MARVEL.	 ONE	 ATOM	 CONTAINS	 THE	 COSMOS,	 ONE	 THOUGHT
PERVADES
EVERYWHERE.	THUS	AN	ANCIENT	SAID:
"INFINITE	LANDS	AND	WORLDS
WITH	NO	DISTINCTIONS	BETWEEN	SELF	AND	OTHERS,
TEN	AGES	PAST	AND	PRESENT
ARE	NEVER	APART	FROM	THIS	MOMENT	OF	THOUGHT."
Shoitsu	is	putting	the	bullocks	behind	the	cart	--	of	course	there	will	not	be	much
progress.	The	bullocks	have	to	be	in	front	of	 the	cart;	 the	words,	 the	language,
have	 to	 be	 a	 primary	 preparation	 for	 the	 ultimate	 understanding	 of	 your	 life
source.	There	is	only	one	way,	and	that	is	pointing	directly	to	your	heart.	There
are	not	some	lower	ways,	some	higher	ways;	there	is	only	one	way.
He	is	saying,	"We	will	 try	 the	second	way,	and	 if	even	 that	does	not	work,	we
will	 go	 still	 lower."	 This	 is	 happening	 because	 he	 is	 putting	 things	 the	wrong
way	 round.	 The	 bullocks	 have	 to	 be	 ahead	 of	 the	 cart,	 and	 then	 everything	 is
okay.	Language,	concepts,	words,	all	have	to	be	used	in	preparing	the	ground	for
emptiness.	And	you	know	by	your	experience	here	that	it	works.	I	am	talking	to
you,	I	am	using	words	and	concepts;	still	a	great	silence	is	being	created	within
you.
This	 silence	 can	 be	 deepened	 by	 meditation.	 And	 when	 you	 are	 deep	 in
meditation,	silent,	just	a	watchful	witness,	the	direct	pointing	by	the	master	can
happen.	 I	 don't	 have	 to	 explain	 it	 to	 you	 because	 you	 go	 through	 the	 process
every	day.
A	Zen	poet,	Kanzan	wrote:
TALKING	ABOUT	FOOD	WON'T	MAKE	YOU	FULL,
BABBLING	OF	CLOTHES	WON'T	KEEP	OUT	THE	COLD.
A	BOWL	OF	RICE	IS	WHAT	FILLS	THE	BELLY;
IT	TAKES	A	SUIT	OF	CLOTHING	TO	MAKE	YOU	WARM.
AND	YET,	WITHOUT	STOPPING	TO	CONSIDER	THIS,
YOU	COMPLAIN	THAT	BUDDHA	IS	HARD	TO	FIND.
TURN	YOUR	MIND	WITHIN!
THERE	HE	IS!
WHY	LOOK	FOR	HIM	ABROAD?
This	 small	 haiku	 says	 much	 more	 than	 Shoitsu,	 and	 clearly.	 Two	 things:
TALKING	 ABOUT	 FOOD	 WON'T	 MAKE	 YOU	 FULL;	 BABBLING	 OF
CLOTHES
WON'T	KEEP	OUT	THE	COLD.	A	BOWL	OF	RICE	 IS	WHAT	FILLS	THE
BELLY;	IT	TAKES	A	SUIT	OF	CLOTHING	TO	MAKE	YOU	WARM.	AND
YET,	WITHOUT
STOPPING	 TO	 CONSIDER	 THIS,	 YOU	 COMPLAIN	 THAT	 BUDDHA	 IS
HARD	TO
FIND.	TURN	YOUR	MIND	WITHIN!	THERE	HE	IS!	WHY	LOOK	FOR	HIM
ABROAD?
You	have	been	looking	for	him	outside	for	centuries,	for	many	many	lives.	It	is
time	 to	give	 a	 chance	 to	your	 interiority.	Look	 for	him	withinwards,	 and	what
you	 have	 not	 found	 outside,	 you	will	 find,	without	 fail,	 inside.	Nobody	 in	 the
whole	 history	 of	 consciousness	 has	 failed	 to	 find	 the	 buddha	 if	 he	 has	 looked
withinwards.	Without	 any	 exception,	 everybody	who	has	 looked	 in,	 has	 found
the	buddha.	You	cannot	be	an	exception.	You	cannot	be,	because	life	itself	in	its
purity	is	the	buddha.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
WHEN	WE	FUNCTION	FROM	THE	PERIPHERY,	WHEN	WE	FUNCTION
OUT	OF
UNAWARENESS,	IT	SEEMS	THAT	OUR	ENERGY	GETS	CAUGHT	UP
SOMEHOW	AND	SO	OUR	MAXIMUM	ENERGY	IS	NOT	AVAILABLE.	IS
IT
TRUE	 THAT	 WHEN	 WE	 FUNCTION	 FROM	 OUR	 EMPTINESS,	 WE
COULD	HAVE
ACCESS	TO	UNLIMITED	ENERGY?
Maneesha,	what	you	are	asking	is	almost	true.	Just	on	one	point	you	have	to	be
reminded
--	that	when	your	energy	is	not	involved	in	anything...	Your	last	sentence	is,	"we
could	 have	 access	 to	 unlimited	 energy."	When	 your	 energy	 is	 not	 involved	 in
anything,	 you	 will	 not	 be	 there.	 So	 the	 question	 of	 your	 access	 to	 unlimited
energy	does	not	arise.	You	will	be	ultimate	energy;	it	will	not	be	something	that
will	be	available	to	you.	You	will	have	merged	with	it,	you	will	be	it.
Never	think	in	terms	of	separation.	It	is	just	one	experience:	you	and	the	cosmos
becoming	one.	There	 is	 no	need...	 the	whole	 cosmos	 is	 you,	 so	never	 think	 in
terms	of	access,	achievement.	Those	words	are	wrong	words.	They	are	perfectly
usable	in	the	ordinary	world,	in	the	ordinary-world	matters,	but	as	you	enter	in,
you	are	entering	into	a	different	dimension	of	being	where	you	have	never	been.
All	your	words	will	defy	you.
Whatever	you	experience	will	not	be	possible	to	express.	And	finally	there	will
be	no	one	to	express	it.
The	ultimate	experience	is	when	you	disappear,	when	there	is	nobody	but	pure
awareness.	 It	 will	 not	 be	 your	 awareness	 or	 my	 awareness,	 it	 will	 be	 simply
awareness.
Before	we	enter	 into	the	meditation,	Sardar	Gurudayal	Singh	has	to	be	given	a
chance....
Popova	the	Russian	mouse	gets	a	visa	to	visit	the	West.	Her	friend,	Barbarov	the
elephant,	 hears	 the	 news	 and	 wants	 to	 go	 along	 too.	 After	 a	 little	 hesitation,
Popova	agrees	to	take	her	friend	with	her.
The	little	mouse	bakes	a	beautiful	loaf	of	French	bread,	slices	it	in	half	down	the
middle,	and	puts	one	half	along	either	side	of	big	Barbarov.
At	 the	 Moscow	 airport,	 the	 police	 officials	 check	 Popova's	 papers	 and	 her
baggage,	and	then	wave	her	through.	Barbarov,	the	elephant,	is	stopped.
"Where	are	your	papers?"	asks	a	policeman.
Popova	 the	mouse	 turns	around,	 really	pissed	off.	 "What's	 the	matter	with	you
guys?"	she	squeaks	loudly.	"Can't	I	even	take	a	sandwich	with	me?"
Swami	Jivan	Joke	is	sitting	with	his	girlfriend,	Ma	Bliss-abyss,	at	the	back	gate.
"Isn't	 it	 wonderful?"	 coos	 Bliss-abyss.	 "This	 is	 our	 third	 anniversary	 of	 being
together,	and	everything	is	so	spiritual!"
"It	is?"	asks	Jivan	Joke,	shaking	and	trying	to	learn	how	to	smoke	a	beedie.
"Sure!"	 smiles	 Bliss-abyss,	 winking	 at	 several	 of	 her	 new	 boyfriends.	 "We've
been	together	for	three	years,	and	now	we	are	experimenting	with	the	other	side
--	being	apart	and	free!"
"Oh,	that!"	says	Joke,	twitching	nervously,	and	trying	to	stay	centered.
"Yes,"	 giggles	 Bliss-abyss,	 "and	 with	 all	 this	 new	 energy	 and	 all	 these	 new
friends...!"
"My	god!"	interrupts	Jivan	Joke.	"Are	you	ovulating	again?"
"No,	silly!"	replies	Bliss-abyss,	"but	since	tonight	is	our	anniversary,	what	shall
we	do?"
"Well,"	 says	 Joke,	 closing	 his	 eyes	 and	 trying	 to	 meditate.	 "Let's	 do	 like
everyone	else	I	know	is	doing	--	let's	go	in	and	celibate!"
General	Jackass,	now	retired,	is	walking	down	the	street	one	day	when	he	sees
Donald	Dixteen.	Donald	used	to	serve	as	the	general's	valet	during	the	last	war.
General	 Jackass	 is	 very	happy	 to	 see	Donald,	 and	 shaking	hands,	 tells	Donald
that	he	is	looking	for	someone	to	take	the	job	as	his	personal	butler.
"You'll	have	exactly	 the	same	duties	you	had	with	me	 in	 the	army,"	smiles	 the
general.
"You	can	begin	by	waking	me	up	tomorrow	morning	at	eight	o'clock."
Donald	 takes	 the	 job,	 and	 the	 following	morning,	 he	 rushes	 into	 the	 general's
bedroom	and	shakes	him	until	he	wakes	up.
Then	he	slaps	the	general's	wife	on	the	ass,	and	shouts,	"Okay,	baby!	Here's	your
twenty	dollars,	it's	time	to	go	home!"
Nivedano...
Nivedano...	Be	silent,	close	your	eyes,	feel	the	body	to	be	completely	frozen.
Look	inwards,	as	deep	as	possible,	because	the	life	source	is	not	very	far	away.	It
is	just	in	your	empty	heart.	An	absolutely	concentrated	look	into	your	being,	and
you	have	encountered	your	buddhahood.
Your	very	life	source	is	also	the	life	source	of	the	whole	universe.
Deeper	and	deeper,	so	that	you	can	gather	the	inner	experience	and	bring	it	out
into	your	daily	life.
Slowly	slowly
your	buddha	has	to	become
your	very	expression,	your	very	lifestyle.
Nivedano...
Let	go.	Just	be	a	watcher...
The	mind	is	there,	the	body	is	there,
but	you	are	not	the	body
and	you	are	not	the	mind.
You	are	just	the	watcher.
This	watcher	is	called	the	buddha.
Watching,	witnessing,	silently	your	heart	becomes	empty.	And	the	empty	heart	is
the	buddha.
Let	it	sink	deep,	in	every	fiber	of	your	being.	This	is	the	most	precious	moment	-
-	when	you	are	just	a	witness	and	a	tremendous	silence	surrounds	you.
It	is	a	great,	blissful	evening.
Your	recognition	of	your	buddha	nature
and	your	recognition	that	you	are	one	with	the	whole...
There	are	not	ten	thousand	buddhas	here
but	just	one	consciousness.
Nivedano...
Come	back.
But	come	back	not	the	way	you	had	gone	in;	come	back	more	gracefully,	more
peacefully,	more	like	a	buddha.
Sit	down	for	a	few	moments	to	recollect	the	experience,	to	remember	the	space
you	have	gone	into,	to	remember	the	path	that	you	have	followed.
Whatever	you	have	experienced	in	your	witnessing	is	going	to	affect	and	change
your	twenty-four	hours'	life.
Unless	meditation	becomes	a	revolution,	a	revolution	of	your	whole	character,	it
is	not	meditation.
Meditation	liberates	you	from	yourself	and	brings	the	new,	original	face	which
we	have	named	 the	buddha.	Remember	 in	your	day-to-day	work	who	you	are.
Let	 your	 inside	 affect	 your	 activities,	 your	 gestures,	 your	 language,	 your
relations.
Okay,	Maneesha?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.
Can	we	celebrate	the	ten	thousand	buddhas?
Yes!

THE	ENLIGHTENED	MAN'S	WORDS	ARE	SOMETIMES	LIKE	A	LION
CROUCHED	 TO	 SPRING,	 SOMETIMES	 LIKE	 THE	 DIAMOND	 KING'S
TREASURE
SWORD.	 SOMETIMES	 THEIR	 EFFECT	 IS	 TO	 SHUT	 THE	 MOUTHS	 OF
THE
WORLD-FAMED	 ONES,	 SOMETIMES	 IT	 IS	 AS	 IF	 THEY	 SIMPLY
FOLLOW	THE
WAVES	COMING	ONE	AFTER	ANOTHER.
WHEN	 THE	 ENLIGHTENED	 MAN	 MEETS	 OTHERS	 WHO	 ARE
ENLIGHTENED,	 THEN	 FRIEND	 MEETS	 FRIEND.	 HE	 VALUES	 THEM,
AND	THEY	ENCOURAGE
EACH	 OTHER.	WHEN	 HE	MEETS	 THOSE	WHO	 ARE	 ADRIFT	 IN	 THE
WORLD,	 THEN	 MASTER	 MEETS	 DISCIPLE.	 HIS	 WAY	 OF	 DEALING
WITH	SUCH	PEOPLE
IS	 FARSIGHTED.	 HE	 STANDS	 FIRM	 BEFORE	 THEM,	 LIKE	 A
THOUSAND-FATHOM	CLIFF.
THEREFORE	 IT	 IS	 SAID	 THAT	 THE	 WAY	 OF	 THE	 ABSOLUTE	 IS
MANIFEST
EVERYWHERE:	 IT	 HAS	 NO	 FIXED	 RULES	 AND	 REGULATIONS.	 THE
MASTER
SOMETIMES	MAKES	A	BLADE	OF	GRASS	STAND	FOR	THE	GOLDEN-
FACED
BUDDHA,	 SIXTEEN	 FEET	 HIGH,	 AND	 SOMETIMES	 MAKES	 THE
GOLDEN-FACED	 BUDDHA,	 SIXTEEN	 FEET	 HIGH,	 STAND	 FOR	 A
BLADE	OF	GRASS.
ON	ANOTHER	OCCASION,	ENGO	SAID:
THE	 UNIVERSE	 IS	 NOT	 VEILED;	 ALL	 ITS	 ACTIVITIES	 LIE	 OPEN.
WHICHEVER
WAY	 HE	 MAY	 GO,	 THE	 ENLIGHTENED	 MAN	 MEETS	 NO
OBSTRUCTION.	AT
ALL	 TIMES	 HE	 BEHAVES	 INDEPENDENTLY.	 HIS	 EVERY	 WORD	 IS
DEVOID	OF
EGOCENTRICITY,	YET	STILL	HAS	THE	POWER	TO	KILL	OTHERS.
ONCE	THE	DELUSIVE	WAY	OF	THINKING	IS	CUT	OFF,	A	THOUSAND
EYES
ARE	SUDDENLY	OPENED.	ONE	WORD	BLOCKING	THE	STREAM	OF
THOUGHT,	 AND	 ALL	 NON-ACTIONS	 ARE	 CONTROLLED.	 IS	 THERE
ANYONE
WHO	 WOULD	 UNDERGO	 THE	 EXPERIENCE	 OF	 DYING	 THE	 SAME
DEATH
AND	LIVING	THE	SAME	LIFE	AS	THE	BUDDHA?	TRUTH	IS	MANIFEST
EVERYWHERE.
Maneesha,	 this	 is	 the	 last	 talk	 of	 the	 series	 called	 THE	 BUDDHA:	 THE
EMPTINESS	OF
THE	HEART.
It	is	very	appropriate	--	exactly	the	right	time	--	that	you	have	brought	the	great
master	Engo's	statement	about	the	enlightened	man.
For	 centuries	man	 has	 been	 thinking	 about	 the	 definition	 of	 enlightenment.	A
long	succession	of	efforts	have	been	made,	but	nobody	has	been	able	to	bring	a
perfect	 definition	 of	 enlightenment,	 or	 of	 enlightened	 men.	 Engo	 comes	 very
close,	almost	to	the	point;	hence	he	has	to	be	heard	with	absolute	silence.	He	is
saying	something	which	is	difficult	to	say.	His	effort	is	tremendously	valuable.
He	says	about	the	enlightened	man:
THE	 ENLIGHTENED	 MAN	 ENJOYS	 PERFECT	 FREEDOM	 IN	 ACTIVE
LIFE.
That	is	the	foundation	of	his	following	statements;	it	has	to	be	understood,	with
all	its	implications.
The	 unconscious	 man	 lives	 according	 to	 others	 --	 either	 following	 them	 or
denying	them,	but	the	focus	is	always	the	other.	So	there	are	followers	and	there
are	 anti-followers;	 there	 are	 theists	 and	 there	 are	 atheists.	 But	 at	 the	 very
foundation	they	are	no	different.	One	is	positively	in	favor	of	some	doctrine	and
one	is	negative,	reactive,	against	 the	same	doctrine,	but	both	are	hanging	on	to
something	other	than	themselves.	They	are	other-oriented.
I	 am	always	 reminded	of	 Jean-Paul	Sartre,	 and	his	 statement	 that	 "the	other	 is
hell."	He	may	have	made	 it	 in	a	different	context,	but	 in	 itself	 the	statement	 is
valuable.	I	want	you	to	know:	the	other	is	hell	because	the	other	takes	away	your
freedom.	 It	 may	 be	 done	 very	 lovingly,	 without	 any	 bad	 intention.	 It	 may	 be
done	with	all	good	intentions	but	that	does	not	matter:	the	ancient	saying	is	that
"the	path	to	hell	is	paved	with	good	intentions."
The	parents,	the	teachers,	the	neighbors,	the	friends	--	all	are	continuously	giving
a	shape	to	your	life,	a	style	to	your	life.	If	you	look	into	your	mind	you	will	find
many	voices	together:	your	father	is	speaking,	your	grandfather	is	speaking,	your
mother,	your	brother,	your	teachers,	your	professors.	But	one	thing	you	will	not
find	 there	 is	 your	 voice.	 Your	 voice	 has	 been	 completely	 repressed	 by	 other
voices.
Layer	upon	layer,	you	have	lost	track	even	of	your	own	voice,	of	your	own	self,
of	your	own	face.	So	many	masks...
When	 a	 small	 child	 comes	 into	 the	 world,	 he	 is	 just	 a	 clean	 slate;	 and	 you
immediately	 start	 writing	 on	 his	 slate	 without	 even	 bothering	 to	 ask	 his
permission.	You	make	him	a	Christian,	you	make	him	a	Hindu,	you	make	him	a
Mohammedan;	you	make	him	anything	you	want	to	make	him	--	and	you	don't
understand	 that	consciousness	 is	not	something	 that	you	can	give	a	mode	 to,	a
certain	pattern.	What	ultimately	happens	from	all	your	efforts	and	intentions	is	a
hypocrite,	a	person	who	knows	that	he	is	doing	something	but	his	heart	is	not	in
it.	He	becomes	phony;	he	becomes	a	slave	of	all	 the	others	who	surround	him.
Not	only	the	living	ones	but	the	dead	ones	also	are	creating	your	slavery.
Engo's	 statement	 is,	 THE	 ENLIGHTENED	 MAN	 ENJOYS	 PERFECT
FREEDOM	IN
ACTIVE	 LIFE.	 He	 is	 not	 a	 slave	 to	 any	 tradition,	 to	 any	 culture,	 to	 any
civilization.	 He	 lives	 according	 to	 his	 own	 spontaneity,	 according	 to	 his	 own
awareness.
And	 that	 is	 one	 of	 the	 troubles:	 the	 enlightened	 person	 is	 bound	 to	 be
misunderstood,	 because	 the	 whole	 world	 is	 full	 of	 slaves.	 They	 cannot
understand	the	language	of	freedom.
It	is	almost	like	selling	eyeglasses	to	a	world	of	blind	people.	Even	if	they	have
the	glasses,	they	are	of	no	use	--	they	cannot	see,	they	don't	have	the	eyes.
A	man	went	to	one	eye	specialist	and	asked	him,	"Check	my	eyes.	Do	you	think
I	will	be	able	to	read	if	you	prescribe	glasses?"
The	eye	specialist	said,	"Of	course	you	will	be	able	to	read."
He	wrote	the	prescription	and	the	glasses	were	made.	But	the	man	said,	"By	the
way,	I	must	inform	you	that	I	don't	know	how	to	read."
The	specialist	said,	"You	are	strange!	You	should	have	said	this	before,	because
even	with	glasses,	if	you	don't	know	how	to	read,	you	are	not	going	to	read."
People	 are	 carrying	 scriptures	which	 describe	 freedom,	which	 even	 talk	 about
freedom	from	scriptures.	People	are	worshipping	statues	of	persons	like	Gautam
Buddha	whose	 last	words	were,	 "Remember	 these	 are	my	 last	words,	my	 last
wish:	my	statues	should	not	be	made."	Ten	thousand	sannyasins	were	listening,
and	as	it	happened,	there	are	now	more	statues	of	Gautam	Buddha	in	the	world
than	of	anyone	else.	A	single	 temple	 in	China	even	has	 ten	 thousand	Buddhas.
The	whole	mountain,	miles	long,	has	been	carved	into	Buddha	statues.
It	is	strange	blindness.	It	is	strange	misunderstanding....
And	a	man	of	freedom	is	bound	to	be	condemned	by	slaves	because	the	slaves
cannot	accept	the	idea	that	they	are	slaves.	So	anybody	who	is	enlightened	and
becomes	a	man	of	freedom,	becomes	a	danger	to	millions	of	egos.	His	freedom
to	fly	across	the	sky	with	open	wings	is	bound	to	be	condemned	by	all	those	who
are	crippled,	who	are	caught	in	cages.	The	cages	may	be	of	gold	--	very	precious,
cozy,	 a	 good	 shelter	 --	 but	 the	 joy	 of	 being	 on	 your	 own	 wings	 in	 the	 sky,
unlimited,	 with	 no	 barriers,	 no	 boundaries,	 is	 much	 more	 valuable	 than	 any
golden	cage.
Engo	 says,	 THE	 ENLIGHTENED	MAN	ENJOYS	 PERFECT	 FREEDOM	 IN
ACTIVE
LIFE.	He	 is	not	bound	by	any	morality,	not	bound	by	any	rules,	not	bound	by
any	ethos,	not	bound	by	any	society,	any	civilization,	any	culture,	any	education.
He	 remains	 true	 and	 honest	 to	 his	 own	 being.	 He	 does	 not	 care	 whether	 his
action	 is	 going	 against	 the	 society,	 whether	 his	 action	 is	 going	 against	 the
scriptures.	All	that	he	is	committed	to	is	his	own	spontaneous	response.	He	has
no	other	commitments.	He	cannot	be	a	Christian	or	a	Mohammedan	or	a	Jew	or
a	Jaina.	He	can	only	be	a	human	being	without	any	fetters.
But	naturally	he	has	 to	 suffer.	He	has	 to	 suffer	because	 the	whole	crowd	 is	of
slaves,	 blind	 people.	 They	 feel	 hurt	 --	 deeply	 hurt	 --	 by	 his	 presence,	 by	 his
freedom.	They	continuously	compare,	and	feel	deep	down	guilty	that	they	have
never	stood	up	for	their	own	freedom.	They	have	remained	sheep,	just	part	of	a
crowd;	 they	 never	 declared	 their	 individuality.	 And	 now	 there	 is	 a	 man	 of
absolute	freedom.
Those	who	have	any	intelligence	will	fall	in	love	with	this	man	of	freedom;	but
very	few	people	have	intelligence.	Most	people	live	without	any	intelligence	in
their	life	--	a	robot	life,	almost	mechanical.	They	all	are	going	to	be	against	such
persons	 --	 in	 the	 name	 of	 religion,	 in	 the	 name	 of	 morality,	 in	 the	 name	 of
society.	 Their	 excuse	 is	 that	 these	 people	 are	 dangerous:	 if	 everybody	 starts
functioning	according	to	his	own	truth,	then	there	will	be	no	society,	no	state,	no
nation,	no	army,	no	war.
The	whole	society	is	committed	to	such	stupid	things	that	a	man	of	enlightened
freedom	cannot	be	committed	to	any	of	them.	He	cannot	be	Indian	or	French	or
Chinese;	the	whole	earth	is	one	for	him.	His	every	action	is	according	to	his	own
consciousness,	 not	 according	 to	 any	 teaching	 of	 some	 dead,	 so-called	 wise
person.	He	has	his	own	eyes	to	see;	why	should	he	listen	to	others?	He	has	his
own	ears	to	hear;	why	should	he	listen	to	others?	He	has	his	own	consciousness
to	decide;	why	should	he	follow	the	ten	commandments	of	Moses,	or	the	Sermon
on	the	Mount	of	Jesus,	or	the	SHRIMAD
BHAGAVADGITA	of	Krishna?	They	may	be	beautiful,	but	they	are	not	going	to
guide	your	life.
The	moment	you	have	guidelines	from	others,	you	are	spiritually	a	slave.
In	other	words,	Engo	is	saying	the	enlightened	man	lives	according	to	his	own
life	 source,	 without	 any	 consideration	 or	 compromise	 with	 the	 crowd.	 He	 is
absolutely	an	individualist	and	he	wants	everybody	else	also	to	be	individualists.
There	is	nothing	more	valuable	than	freedom	because	only	in	freedom	can	you
blossom	to	your	ultimate	potential.	As	a	slave	you	are	crippled,	you	are	cut,	you
are	 in	 a	mold;	 you	 are	 in	 chains,	 you	 are	 in	 cages	 --	 different	 sizes	 of	 cages,
different	forms	of	cages....
But	 remember	one	 thing:	 that	which	has	not	arisen	within	you	 is	always	some
kind	of	slavery.
The	 first	 definition	 of	 the	 enlightened	 man	 is	 PERFECT	 FREEDOM	 IN
ACTIVE	LIFE.
He	is	bound	to	be	condemned,	because	the	crowd	gets	disturbed.	The	crowd	gets
disturbed	because	such	a	man	is	going	to	destroy	their	slavery,	which	they	think
is	a	very	cozy	and	safe	lifestyle.
I	am	reminded	of	a	story.
In	a	mountainous	 region,	a	man	of	 freedom	rested	 for	a	day	 in	a	caravanserai.
That	caravanserai	had	a	beautiful	parrot,	and	the	owner	had	taught	 the	parrot...
The	parrot	was	continuously	asking	for	freedom	--	"Freedom!"	It	was	strange....
The	 stranger,	 an	enlightened	man,	 could	not	believe	 this	whole	 thing.	Because
first	you	put	him	in	the	cage,	and	then	you	teach	him	to	repeat	"Freedom!"	If	the
owner	is	honest,	he	should	give	him	freedom!
In	 the	 night,	 he	 could	 not	 resist.	He	woke	 up,	 opened	 the	 door	 of	 the	 parrot's
cage,	and	told	the	parrot,	"Now	the	doors	are	open	and	the	whole	sky	is	yours.
Get	out!"
And	 the	 parrot	 was	 clinging	 to	 the	 cage,	 and	 still	 shouting	 loudly,	 "Freedom,
freedom!"
Finally	the	man	said,	"This	is	strange	--	the	door	is	open!	Why	are	you	clinging
to	the	cage?"
He	 forced	his	hand	 inside,	 took	 the	parrot	out	 --	 it	was	very	unwilling,	gave	a
good	 fight,	 scratched	his	hand	 --	but	 the	man	 took	 the	parrot	out,	 and	 threw	 it
into	 the	 sky.	Then,	 feeling	a	deep	 relief,	 he	went	 to	 sleep.	 In	 the	morning,	 the
first	thing	he	heard	was,
"Freedom!"
He	looked	out	and	the	parrot	was	inside	the	cage;	the	door	was	still	open....
Outside	 the	cage	 it	 is	 such	a	vast	 life,	one	becomes	afraid.	There	are	enemies;
there	will	be	days	 that	are	 too	cold,	 there	will	be	nights	 that	are	 too	hot,	 there
will	 be	 times	 you	will	 have	 to	 go	 hungry.	 There	will	 be	 nobody	 continuously
protecting	you.
Once	you	have	become	accustomed	to	living	in	a	cage,	freedom	becomes	a	very
dangerous	idea.
Twenty-one	countries	have	decided	about	me,	that	I	am	a	dangerous	man.	I	have
not	killed	a	single	ant	 in	my	whole	 life;	 I	have	never	used	even	a	paper	knife,
and	 the	 parliaments	 of	 twenty-one	 countries	 decide	 that	 I'm	 a	 dangerous	man.
And	nobody	asks,
"What	is	the	definition	of	danger?	Why	is	this	man	dangerous?"
I	am	not	a	terrorist,	I	am	not	teaching	people	how	to	make	bombs,	I	am	not	an
anarchist.
But	the	danger	is	that	I	spread	the	fire	of	freedom.	I	wake	people	up,	saying	that
unless	you	demand	your	freedom	--	from	all	kinds	of	chains,	handcuffs,	from	all
kinds	of	cages	-
-	 you	 can	 never	 be	 a	Gautam	Buddha.	You	will	 never	 know	 the	 joys	 and	 the
blessings	and	the	ecstasies	of	freedom.	You	will	never	know	your	own	eternity.
You	will	 always	be	 afraid	of	death,	 not	 knowing	 that	 death	 is	 a	 fiction	 --	 it	 is
very	superficial,	it	occurs	only	on	the	surface.	Inside,	life	continues	forever	and
forever.
But	to	know	all	this	you	need	freedom.	And	this	freedom	is	not	social	or	political
or	economic;	 this	 freedom	is	spiritual.	You	need	 to	go	 inside	yourself	and	find
that	space	which	has	not	yet	been	chained.	Finding	that	space	from	where	your
life	 arises,	 you	 will	 attain	 enlightenment	 and	 freedom	 together;	 they	 are	 two
different	names	for	the	same,	single	experience.
Engo	says:
HE	 IS	 LIKE	 A	 DRAGON	 SUPPORTED	 BY	 DEEP	 WATERS	 OR	 LIKE	 A
TIGER
THAT	COMMANDS	ITS	MOUNTAIN	RETREAT.	THE	MAN	WHO	IS	NOT
ENLIGHTENED	DRIFTS	ABOUT	IN	THE	AFFAIRS	OF	THE	WORLD.
Just	watch	yourself.	What	have	you	been	doing	in	 the	world?	Just	drifting	like
deadwood,	 no	 direction,	 no	 dimension,	 no	 clarity,	 no	 vision.	 Just	 following	 a
crowd	 --	 not	 even	 knowing	where	 you	 are	 going,	 just	 trusting	 that	 the	 crowd
must	know:	if	so	many	people	are	going,	then	we	must	be	right	because	so	many
people	cannot	be	wrong.
And	the	reality	is,	so	many	people	cannot	be	right!	To	be	right	is	a	very	unique
experience;	to	be	right	is	to	be	enlightened.
Beware	 of	 this	 unconscious	 calculation	 that	 because	 the	whole	world	 is	 doing
something,	 it	 must	 be	 right;	 so	 many	 people	 cannot	 be	 wrong.	 This	 is	 the
arithmetic	we	have	been	 living.	So	we	 stumble,	we	grope	 in	 the	 darkness;	we
follow	this	man,	we	follow	that	man,	and	we	never	think,	"If	we	are	alive,	then
there	must	be	a	source	within	us	--	has	to	be	--
otherwise	from	where	does	our	life	come?"
Without	knowing	this	source,	even	if	you	are	following	a	buddha	you	are	going
to	 go	 astray.	 Because	 every	 individual	 is	 so	 unique,	 you	 can	 never	 follow
anybody.
THE	 MAN	 WHO	 IS	 NOT	 ENLIGHTENED	 DRIFTS	 ABOUT	 IN	 THE
AFFAIRS	OF
THE	WORLD.
Your	life,	if	it	is	not	enlightened,	is	nothing	but	a	drifting.
A	strange	incident	happened....
I	had	gone	to	enroll	in	a	college,	and	they	gave	me	a	form	to	fill	out.	One	young
man	of	my	age	was	also	holding	a	form	in	his	hand.	He	looked	at	my	form	and
he	said,	"What	subjects	are	you	filling	in?"
I	said,	"That	is	none	of	your	business.	You	fill	in	your	subjects."
He	said,	"I	don't	know	what	subjects	to	fill	in."
So	he	looked	at	my	form,	and	because	I	had	filled	in	philosophy,	psychology	and
politics,	he	filled	in	the	same.	I	said,	"This	is	very	strange."
He	said,	"No,	because	I	don't	know	what	to	do	with	my	life."
We	graduated	from	the	same	college,	and	then	I	changed	to	the	university.	And	it
was	such	a	surprise:	when	I	entered	the	office	that	same	fellow	was	waiting	there
with	his	form!	He	said,	"You	have	come!	I	have	been	wondering	what	to	do;	it
has	been	such	a	joy	to	fill	in	the	form	according	to	you.	Now	what	are	you	going
to	study	for	your	post-graduation?"
I	said,	"This	is	very	stupid."
He	said,	"No,	it	has	been	a	great	relief	that	at	least	somebody	knows	where	he	is
going,	and	I	am	following."
So	 he	 looked	 at	 my	 form,	 and	 filled	 in	 his	 accordingly:	 philosophy,	 religion,
psychology.
I	said,	"This	is	not	a	right	way	of	living.	It	is	becoming	a	carbon	copy."
But	he	said,	"I	am	perfectly	at	ease.	If	you	are	taking	these	subjects,	they	must	be
the	best	subjects	available	in	the	university."
I	said,	"I	have	no	objection..."
In	one	of	my	post-graduate	classes,	the	professor	was	a	very	orthodox	brahmin
from	Bengal	--	so	orthodox	that	I	have	never	come	across	anybody	else	like	him.
He	would	 not	 teach	with	 open	 eyes	 because	 there	were	 two	 girls	 in	 the	 class:
girls	he	cannot	look	at,	he	is	a	celibate.	It	was	a	good	opportunity,	so	I	slept	all
the	time.	And	he	thought	that	perhaps	I	was	also	a	great	celibate!
So	 there	were	 those	 two	 girls,	 and	 this	 boy	who	 had	 been	 following	me.	 The
professor	was	very	inquisitive.	One	day	he	got	hold	of	me	in	the	library	and	said,
"It	is	very	rare	to	find	people	these	days	who	are	committed	to	celibacy."
I	said,	"You	are	under	a	wrong	impression."
He	said,	"Wrong	impression?"
I	said,	"Why	are	you	closing	your	eyes?"
He	said,	"I	am	a	celibate	and	I	don't	want	to	see	any	female	face."
I	 said,	 "That	 is	 true,	 that	 is	 also	my	 reason	 --	because	both	 those	girls	 are	not
worth	seeing!	But	it	is	not	celibacy.	Day	after	day,	those	same	two	girls;	I	simply
keep	my	eyes	closed."
He	 said,	 "My	 god!	 We	 are	 doing	 the	 same	 action	 but	 our	 reasons	 are	 so
different."
And	 that	 boy	 was	 the	 only	 other	 person	 in	 the	 class.	 He	 was	 such	 a	 great
follower,	but	he	was	at	a	loss	for	what	to	do	--	to	close	his	eyes	because	I	was
closing	mine,	the	professor	was	closing	his	and	just	those	two	girls...	But	he	was
very	much	interested	in	those	girls,	although	the	girls	were	not	showing	any	sign
of	interest	in	him.	He	was	very	disappointed.	He	told	me,	"You	will	have	to	help
me.	You	have	always	helped	 --	 since	 I	entered	college	you	have	been	of	great
help;	now	you	have	to	help."
I	said,	"What	is	the	problem?"
He	said,	"The	problem	is	 that	 I	 try	 in	every	way	 to	 talk	 to	 those	girls	but	 they
don't	take	any	interest	in	me;	they	don't	even	care	about	me.	They	pass	by	me	as
if	I	am	not	there	--
it	hurts."
I	said,	"You	have	to	do	something	rightly."
So	I	wrote	a	love	letter	for	him,	and	I	said,	"Tomorrow	you	deliver	it	yourself."
He	said,	"This	is	very	dangerous;	you	have	made	me	sign	it.	You	have	written	all
these	things	and	if	I	am	caught,	if	the	girl	freaks	out,	or	anything..."
I	 said,	 "You	don't	be	worried;	 I	will	prepare	 the	girl,	because	 I	have	 taken	 the
responsibility.	That's	why	I	am	saying	tomorrow	you	deliver	it.	Just	give	me	one
day's	chance	to	prepare	the	girl."
I	told	the	girl,	"This	boy	is	very	poor	--	spiritually	poor	--	he	needs	compassion."
The	girl	said,	"What	can	I	do?"
I	 said,	 "You	 don't	 have	 to	 do	 anything.	 He	 will	 deliver	 a	 love	 letter	 to	 you
tomorrow;	you	accept	it	with	a	smiling	face."
She	said,	"You	are	creating	trouble.	I	don't	like	that	fellow."
I	 said,	 "There	 is	 no	 question	 of	 liking	 or	 not	 liking;	 you	 can	 even	 hate	 that
fellow.	 But	 receiving	 the	 letter,	 just	 like	 a	 nice	 lady...	 it	 is	 not	 against	 any
manners,	any	etiquette."
She	said,	"If	you	say,	I	will	accept	the	letter."
Then	I	said,	"It	is	not	the	end.	You	have	to	write	a	letter	too."
She	 said,	 "My	 god!	 You	 are	 creating	 trouble	 for	 me.	 If	 my	 father	 comes	 to
know"	--	and	her	father	was	the	collector	of	that	city	--	"if	he	comes	to	know...
He	is	a	dangerous	fellow,	he	can	even	shoot.	He	goes	on	shining	his	gun	every
day,	and	he	has	told	me,
`Don't	get	involved	in	any	love	affair;	otherwise	somebody	is	going	to	be	shot!'"
I	said,	"I	will	prepare	your	father,	you	don't	be	worried.	If	anybody	is	going	to	be
shot,	I	am	the	fellow	who	is	ready	because	I	have	nothing	to	lose.	It	is	perfectly
good,	he	can	shoot	me.	But	you	will	have	to	write	a	 letter,	because	this	fellow
just	needs	a	hope.	Don't	write	too	many	sweet	things,	just..."
She	said,	"Okay,	I	will	try.	But	I	don't	know,	I	have	never	written	a	love	letter."
I	said,	"My	god...	I	will	write	it."	So	I	wrote	a	love	letter	and	she	signed	it.
A	few	 love	 letters	were	exchanged	and	finally	 the	girl	came	 to	me	 to	say	 that,
"My	 father	 seems	 to	 be	 getting	 suspicious.	 You	 have	 put	 me	 into	 trouble,
because	now	that	boy	has	at	least	seven	letters	signed	by	me."
I	said,	"That	boy	is	not	a	real	person,	he	is	a	carbon	copy.	Don't	be	worried	about
him.	I	will	take	back	all	your	letters."
I	 told	 the	 boy,	 "Listen,	 the	 father	 of	 the	 girl	 is	 very	 dangerous	 and	 he	 keeps
polishing	his	gun."
He	said,	"My	god!	And	you	never	told	me	before?	Where	does	he	live?"
I	said,	"He	is	a	collector	and	he	lives	in	the	city,	three	or	four	miles	away	from
the	university.	But	now	your	life	is	in	danger."
He	said,	"You	wrote	those	letters..."
I	said,	"It	does	not	matter	who	wrote	them.	What	matters	is	who	signed!"
He	said,	"Now	save	me	somehow,	I	don't	want	to	get	into	trouble.	If	I	had	known
that	love	means	trouble,	I	would	not	have	fallen	in	love."
So	 I	 said,	 "You	 give	 all	 those	 letters	 back	 to	 me."	 He	 said,	 "Then	 what	 will
happen	to	my	letters	which	are	in	the	girl's	hands?"
I	said,	"I	will	take	back	those	letters	too."
He	said,	"Don't	forget!	because	those	seven	letters	will	keep	me	always	falling	in
love.
Just	 I	have	 to	copy	one	 letter,	because	I	cannot	manage...	you	have	made	such
beautiful	letters.	I	don't	care	that	the	girl	is	lost,	but	those	letters	I	would	miss	my
whole	life!"
I	took	back	the	letters	from	both	sides.
After	ten	years,	I	found	him	in	another	city.	He	had	become	a	professor,	and	he
had	a	wife	and	children.	I	said,	"You	managed	perfectly	well."
He	 said,	 "The	whole	 credit	 goes	 to	 you.	 Those	 letters	worked	miraculously.	 I
tried	them	on	many	girls	and	was	refused,	but	this	girl..."
And	 I	 saw	why	 this	 girl...	 because	 she	was	 not	much	 of	 a	 girl.	 She	 even	 had
some	moustache	 growing!	 I	 said	 to	 him,	 "You	 are	 a	 fool!	You	 should	 have	 at
least	asked	me.	I	would	have	managed	some	other	girl.	There	are	so	many	girls	-
-	the	whole	world	is	full	of	girls,	and	you	are	such	a	nice	looking	fellow."
He	said,	"Something	is	wrong	with	this	girl?"
I	said,	"It	is	not	a	girl	at	all!	Look	at	her	moustache."
I	have	come	across	only	two	women:	one	was	this	girl,	and	one	was	the	daughter
of	one	of	my	principals;	she	had	a	little	beard.	I	think	it	is	perfectly	good,	there	is
no	harm,	but	I	said	to	that	fellow,	"You	are	an	idiot	from	the	very	beginning,	and
without	my	help	you	should	not	have	taken	this	step."
He	said,	"Now	it	is	too	late.	I	have	got	three	children."	All	ugly!	I	told	him,	"It
was	absolutely	certain	that	you	would	do	something	nasty	like	this."
He	said,	"Is	there	something	wrong	with	my	children?"
I	said,	"Will	you	ever	mature?	I	don't	think	so,	in	this	life."
He	said,	"But	everybody	says,	looking	at	my	children,	`How	nice	they	look!'"
I	said,	"Whenever	somebody	says	to	a	woman	that	her	child	looks	very	nice,	that
simply	means	that	the	child	is	ugly."
I	told	him	about	an	incident	that	happened	in	a	bus:
A	woman	was	holding	her	child,	and	an	old	drunkard	came	across,	looked	very
closely	 at	 the	 child,	 and	 said,	 "My	 god!	 This	must	 be	 the	 ugliest	 child	 in	 the
whole	world!"
The	woman	 started	 crying	 and	weeping;	 these	 things	 are	not	 to	be	 said.	But	 a
drunk	fellow...
The	 bus	 was	 stopped,	 because	 the	 driver	 said,	 "It	 doesn't	 seem	 right	 that	 the
woman	is	crying."	So	he	went	to	the	woman,	and	he	said,	"Don't	cry.	That	fellow
was	a	drunk.	And	I	don't	know	what	he	has	said	to	you,	but	I	will	bring	you	a
cup	of	tea."
So	he	brought	a	cup	of	tea	and	gave	it	to	the	woman,	and	said,	"Just	drink	the	tea
and	 forget	what	 that	drunkard	did.	And	 I	have	also	brought	 a	banana	 for	your
monkey."
People	never	think,	what	kind	of	children	they	are	having.	That	drunkard	was	at
least	honest,	and	the	driver	was	also	honest.
But	unconscious	people	go	on	doing	things	without	any	reason	and	rhyme.	The
unconscious	man	 is	basically	a	 follower	 in	every	dimension	of	 life.	He	doesn't
have	 the	 sense	 to	 find	 a	 direction	 for	 himself.	 He	 is	 always	 looking	 for
somebody	to	guide	him.	He	is	bound	to	fall	into	a	long	dark	night	which	has	no
end.
One	thing	has	to	be	decided	by	every	individual	--	particularly	my	people	have
to	decide	it	--	to	find	your	own	life	source,	to	find	out	what	your	potentials	are,
and	let	them	grow.
Even	 if	 you	 go	 against	 the	whole	world,	 at	 least	 you	will	 be	 fulfilled	 in	 your
freedom.
Otherwise	you	become	just	driftwood;	anybody	can	give	you	a	shape,	anybody
can	give	you	a	direction,	anybody	can	give	you	guidelines.

BLADE	OF	GRASS.
You	all	know	about	a	Zen	master	who	was	staying	in	a	temple,	just	for	the	night.
It	was	a	cold	night,	and	in	Japan	the	Buddha	statues	are	made	of	wood	--	in	India
they	are	made	of	marble;	you	will	not	find	even	one	single	wooden	Buddha	in
India.	But	in	Japan	they	use	wood,	and	very	aesthetically.
There	were	 three	Buddhas	 in	 the	 temple,	 and	 it	was	 a	 very	 cold	 night,	 so	 the
master	took	one	Buddha,	and	built	a	fire.
The	priest	of	the	temple	lived	nearby.	He	suddenly	saw	light	and	fire	inside	the
temple.
He	came	running,	he	said,	"I	was	from	the	very	beginning	suspicious;	your	every
activity	 seems	 to	 be	 out	 of	 tune	with	 others.	What	 have	 you	 done?	You	 have
burned	 one	 of	my	Buddhas!	 I	 gave	 you	 shelter,	 and	 this	 is	 the	way	 you	 have
shown	your	gratefulness!"
The	master	took	his	staff	and	started	looking	in	the	ashes	--	Buddha	was	gone.
The	priest	said,	"What	are	you	doing	now?"
He	said,	"I	am	looking	for	the	bones."
The	priest	said,	"You	are	really	crazy!	It	was	a	wooden	Buddha,	and	wood	does
not	have	bones."
The	master	said,	"You	are	intelligent,	you	can	understand.	Now	look:	the	night	is
only	half	gone	and	it	is	so	cold.	You	have	two	Buddhas	more,	and	while	a	living
buddha	 is	 suffering	 from	 cold,	 you	 are	 protecting	 your	wooden	Buddhas.	 Just
bring	one	of	the	Buddhas	here!"
The	 priest	 just	 took	 hold	 of	 the	 master	 and	 forced	 him	 out	 of	 the	 temple,
shouting	that
"You	will	destroy	my	whole	temple!"
And	 in	 the	morning	 he	 saw	 that	 the	 same	master...	 just	 in	 front	 of	 the	 temple
there	 was	 a	milestone.	 The	master	 has	 picked	 a	 few	wildflowers	 and	 has	 put
those	wildflowers	on	the	stone,	and	is	sitting	in	deep	meditation	by	its	side.
The	priest	said,	"My	god!	He	has	destroyed	a	Buddha	in	the	night,	and	now	on	a
milestone	he	has	put	flowers	as	if	it	is	a	Buddha	--	and	next	to	it	he	is	sitting	in
deep	meditation."	So	he	came	out,	shook	him	and	said,	"What	are	you	doing?"
He	said,	"I	am	worshipping	the	Buddha.	If	you	can	worship	wood,	what	is	wrong
in	worshipping	a	stone?	Your	Buddha	was	a	little	shapely,	a	well-cut	design.	My
Buddha	is	raw.	But	it	is	a	perfect	Buddha	as	far	as	meditation	is	concerned.	I	can
use	anything	to	show	my	gratitude;	the	whole	existence	is	one."
A	man	of	enlightened	freedom	can	make	A	BLADE	OF	GRASS	STAND	FOR
THE
GOLDEN-FACED	 BUDDHA,	 SIXTEEN	 FEET	 HIGH,	 AND	 SOMETIMES
MAKES
THE	GOLDEN-FACED	BUDDHA,	 SIXTEEN	FEET	HIGH,	 STAND	FOR	A
BLADE
OF	GRASS.
He	 is	 not	 confined	 by	 any	 rules	 and	 regulations;	 he	 is	 not	 confined	 by	 any
etiquette	or	manners.	His	freedom	is	total.	He	acts	out	of	his	spontaneity,	 love,
compassion,	but	he	does	not	 follow	any	 rules.	You	cannot	 expect	of	 a	buddha
that	he	will	do	the	same	thing	tomorrow	that	he	did	today.	He	will	say,	"Today	is
today,	and	tomorrow	is	tomorrow.
Today	 this	 is	 my	 response,	 in	 this	 context;	 tomorrow	 the	 context	 will	 be
different,	 and	my	 response	 is	 going	 to	be	different.	 I	 respond	 to	 situations	not
with	any	prejudice,	but	with	a	pure,	empty	heart."
ON	ANOTHER	OCCASION,	ENGO	SAID:
THE	 UNIVERSE	 IS	 NOT	 VEILED;	 ALL	 ITS	 ACTIVITIES	 LIE	 OPEN.
WHICHEVER
WAY	 HE	 MAY	 GO,	 THE	 ENLIGHTENED	 MAN	 MEETS	 NO
OBSTRUCTION.	AT
ALL	 TIMES	 HE	 BEHAVES	 INDEPENDENTLY.	 HIS	 EVERY	 WORD	 IS
DEVOID	OF
EGOCENTRICITY,	YET	STILL	HAS	THE	POWER	TO	KILL	OTHERS.
ONCE	THE	DELUSIVE	WAY	OF	THINKING	IS	CUT	OFF,	A	THOUSAND
EYES
ARE	SUDDENLY	OPENED.	ONE	WORD	BLOCKING	THE	STREAM	OF
THOUGHT,	 AND	 ALL	 NON-ACTIONS	 ARE	 CONTROLLED.	 IS	 THERE
ANYONE
WHO	 WOULD	 UNDERGO	 THE	 EXPERIENCE	 OF	 DYING	 THE	 SAME
DEATH
AND	LIVING	THE	SAME	LIFE	AS	THE	BUDDHA?	TRUTH	IS	MANIFEST
EVERYWHERE.
The	 enlightened	 man	 lives	 a	 life	 of	 freedom;	 he	 also	 dies	 a	 death	 of	 utter
freedom.
Neither	life	can	make	him	a	slave,	nor	death.
Gautam	Buddha	himself,	one	day	in	the	early	morning	twenty-five	centuries	ago,
told	Ananda,	"Call	all	the	monks	together	under	those	two	saal	trees"	--	which	he
always	loved;	he	used	to	sit	under	those	saal	trees	for	meditations	or	for	his	talks.
He	said,
"Arrange	 a	bed	 for	me	under	 those	 saal	 trees	because	 I	 am	going	 to	 leave	 the
body.	And	inform	everybody	that	if	they	want	to	ask	any	question,	they	should
ask."
All	 the	monks	 gathered,	 they	 had	 tears	 in	 their	 eyes.	But	Buddha	 said,	 "Tears
won't	help.
If	you	have	any	question	you	can	ask,	because	tomorrow	I	will	not	be	here."
The	elder,	enlightened	disciples	said,	"You	have	spoken	for	forty-two	years;	you
have	said	everything	that	is	needed	for	a	seeker.	We	don't	have	any	question;	just
relax	peacefully."
So	Buddha	closed	his	eyes.	He	said,	"First	I	will	leave	the	body,	then	I	will	leave
the	mind,	then	I	will	leave	the	heart	and	disappear	into	emptiness."
A	man	from	the	nearby	town,	who	had	been	postponing	for	thirty	years	because
Buddha	was	coming	and	going	through	his	town	again	and	again...	he	wanted	to
meet	Buddha,	he	wanted	to	ask	something,	but	there	was	always	some	excuse	--
a	customer	suddenly	came,	and	now	he	cannot	leave	the	shop,	or	his	wife	is	sick,
or	some	other	business,	or	he	has	to	go	to	somebody's	marriage.	So	many	times
Buddha	passed	through	the	town,	and	he	had	the	idea	to	meet	him.
He	suddenly	heard	that	Buddha	was	going	to	die.	Now	no	excuse	could	prevent
him.	He	rushed	to	the	outside	of	 the	city	where	Buddha's	campus	was.	And	he
went	there	and	said,	"I	want	to	ask	one	question!"
Ananda	said,	"Now	we	have	told	him	there	is	no	question,	and	he	has	closed	his
eyes.	We	don't	know	how	far	he	has	gone,	but	we	cannot	call	him	back.	It	will	be
too	ungrateful.
He	has	passed	through	your	town	so	many	times,	what	were	you	doing?"
He	said,	"Always	some	excuse..."
But	Buddha	opened	his	eyes.	He	said,	"Ananda,	let	him	ask	the	question	so	that
in	 the	coming	centuries	nobody	can	blame	me	that	somebody	asked	a	question
and	I	did	not	answer."
"But,"	Ananda	said,	"you	were	almost	dead!"
He	said,	"Almost,	but	not	completely.	I	had	left	the	body,	I	had	left	the	mind;	I
was	 just	 going	 to	 leave	 the	heart	when	 I	 heard.	 It	 does	not	matter	 if	 I	 delay	 a
little	more	before	disappearing	into	the	ultimate	emptiness,	but	this	poor	fellow
should	not	remain	unanswered."
A	Buddha	 lives	 in	 freedom	 in	his	 life,	 and	 lives	 in	 freedom	even	 in	his	death.
Death	for	him	is	just	an	episode	like	other	episodes	of	life.
Kanzan	wrote:
PEOPLE	ASK	THE	WAY	TO	COLD	MOUNTAIN.
COLD	MOUNTAIN?	THERE	IS	NO	ROAD	THAT	GOES	THROUGH.
EVEN	IN	SUMMER	THE	ICE	DOESN'T	MELT.
THOUGH	THE	SUN	COMES	OUT,	THE	FOG	IS	BLINDING.
HOW	CAN	YOU	HOPE	TO	GET	THERE	BY	APING	ME?
YOUR	HEART	AND	MINE	ARE	NOT	ALIKE.
IF	YOUR	HEART	WERE	THE	SAME	AS	MINE,
THEN	YOU	COULD	JOURNEY	TO	THE	VERY	CENTER!
Kanzan	is	saying	that	followers	are	not	needed.	Following	is	a	kind	of	aping,	it	is
not	 human.	But	 there	 is	 a	 different	way	 of	 being	with	 a	master	 and	 that	 is	 to
bring	your	heartbeat	in	tune	with	his	heartbeat.	Then	you	can	travel	as	a	fellow
traveler	 to	 the	 ultimate	 center	 of	 existence.	 This	 can	 be	 remembered	 as	 a
criterion:	if	anybody	tries	to	be	your	master,	in	a	very	subtle	way	he	is	trying	to
impose	a	slavery	on	you.
The	authentic	master	is	master	of	himself.	He	does	not	want	followers,	he	wants
friends,	fellow	companions,	fellow	travelers,	who	are	ready	to	be	in	tune	with	his
heart,	in	tune	with	his	emptiness.	The	people	who	pretend	to	be	masters	and	are
followed	by	others...
they	even	count!
I	 met	 one	 shankaracharya	 and	 he	 asked	 me	 immediately,	 "How	many	 people
follow	your	philosophy?"
I	said,	"Neither	do	 I	have	any	philosophy,	nor	have	 I	met	any	follower.	 I	have
friends	 all	 around	 the	 world.	 At	 the	 most	 I	 can	 say	 that	 I	 am	 in	 love	 with
thousands	of	people.	Their	hearts	have	come	to	a	certain	synchronicity	with	me
but	they	are	not	my	followers."
But	that	old	shankaracharya	said,	"Unless	you	have	followers,	a	great	following,
you	cannot	be	counted	as	a	great	master."	He	said,	"I	myself	have	five	thousand
followers."
I	said,	"You	can	believe	that	you	are	a	great	master,	but	according	to	me	you	are
a	 great	 slave-creator.	 You	 are	 taking	 people's	 freedom.	 You	 cannot	 be	 a
compassionate	 sympathizer;	 you	 are	 really	 bragging	 about	 your	 followers	 the
same	way	somebody	brags	about	his	money,	somebody	brags	about	his	political
power.	You	are	not	an	authentic	master."
That	night	in	Firozabad	I	had	to	speak.	The	shankaracharya	had	called	a	meeting
and	he	had	invited	me,	not	knowing	much	about	me.	And	in	the	morning	in	the
discussion	 it	 became	 clear	 that	 he	 had	 been	 absolutely	 wrong	 in	 inviting	 me
because	on	every	point	I	discussed	with	him	I	had	told	him,	"You	are	absolutely
wrong."
In	the	meeting	that	night	--	 there	must	have	been	at	least	fifty	thousand	people
there	--	he	had	arranged	for	four	criminals	to	be	standing	behind	me,	so	that	if	I
said	 anything	 against	 the	 tradition	 or	 scriptures,	 then	 they	 should	 immediately
put	out	the	light	and	hit	me	as	much	as	they	could.
But	his	secretary	became	a	little	worried,	so	he	came	to	me	just	as	I	was	leaving
for	the	meeting.	He	said,	"This	is	the	situation.	My	suggestion	is	that	you	should
not	go,	because	this	is	his	sheer	violent	mind.	He	could	not	win	on	a	single	point
in	the	morning	discussion"	--	and	it	was	a	small	group	of	his	great	disciples.	"It
is	very	risky	for	you	to	go."
I	said,	"Don't	be	worried."	When	I	arrived	I	told	the	people	gathered	there,	"You
see	the	four	persons	standing	behind	me?	These	are	all	criminals,	they	belong	to
your	town	and	you	know	perfectly	well	who	they	are.	What	can	be	the	purpose
for	them	to	stand	behind	me?	Their	plan	is	that	the	moment	I	start	speaking	they
will	put	the	lights	off	and	hit	me	or	kill	me.	What	do	you	want?	Should	I	start?
Just	raise	your	hands!	I	don't	care	about	my	life;	I	only	care	about	my	freedom.
If	you	are	ready	to	listen,	then	at	any	risk	I	am	going	to	speak.	But	you	can	see
this	violence	in	the	mind	of	your	shankaracharya.	These	are	his	people."
Those	fifty	thousand	people	raised	their	hands,	and	shouted	that	I	should	speak,
and	 "If	 anything	 happens	 to	 you	 the	 shankaracharya	 will	 not	 leave	 the	 stage
alive."
I	 spoke,	 and	 I	 hit	 him	 as	 hard	 as	 possible.	 Those	 four	 criminals	 --	 everybody
recognized	 them;	 they	were	 from	 the	 town	 --	 simply	disappeared,	because	 this
was	very	dangerous;	now	they	could	not	put	the	lights	off.	Fifty	thousand	people
were	with	me.
And	they	were	all	really	the	shankaracharya's	people,	but	they	could	see	that	this
was	 sheer	 violence;	 it	 did	 not	 show	 the	 intelligence	 or	 wisdom	 of	 an	 old
shankaracharya.	It	showed	his	stupidity.	If	he	could	not	answer	he	should	accept
defeat,	but	this	is	not	the	way	to	behave.	And	he	had	invited	me	to	come	--	from
Bombay	I	went	to	his	place.	I	was	alone,	all	the	people	were	his	people,	but	even
his	people	could	see	that	this	was	not	the	way	of	any	enlightened	person.
The	 enlightened	 person	 is	 not	 violent.	 And	 to	 make	 somebody	 a	 disciple,
according	 to	 me,	 is	 a	 very	 subtle	 violence.	 You	 are	 destroying	 that	 person's
individuality.	You	are	taking	his	freedom	in	your	hands.
In	 this	 place	 everybody	 is	 an	 individual;	 nobody	 is	 superior	 and	 nobody	 is
inferior.	This	is	a	gathering	of	people	who	are	in	love,	of	people	who	are	in	an
inquiry	for	truth.	This	kind	of	gathering	has	disappeared	from	the	world.	You	are
living	 these	moments	here	with	me	--	 it	 is	almost	 the	same	climate	as	Gautam
Buddha	created,	the	same	climate	as	Mahakashyapa	created.	It	is	a	different	air,
it	 is	an	air	where	everybody's	potential	 is	 respected,	 loved.	Where	everybody's
freedom	is	the	ultimate	value.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked	a	question:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
I	 FIND	 IT	 MORE	 DIFFICULT	 TO	 DISIDENTIFY	 FROM	 MY	 FEELINGS
THAN
FROM	 MY	 THOUGHTS.	 IT	 SEEMS	 THAT	 THIS	 IS	 BECAUSE	 MY
FEELINGS	ARE
MORE	ROOTED	IN	MY	BODY.
ARE	 FEELINGS	 CLOSER	 TO	 THE	 HEAD,	 IN	 FACT,	 THAN	 TO	 THE
EMPTY
HEART?
This	 is	 a	 fallacy	 created	 by	 the	 poets.	 Your	 thoughts,	 your	 feelings,	 your
emotions,	 your	 sentiments,	 all	 are	 centered	 in	your	head.	 It	 is	 just	 a	 fallacy	 to
think	 that	 your	 feelings	 are	 in	 the	 heart.	 Your	 heart	 is	 just	 a	 blood	 pumping
station.
When	 we	 are	 talking	 about	 the	 empty	 heart,	 we	 are	 really	 talking	 about	 the
empty	mind.
Buddha	 has	 used	 the	 word	 `heart'	 instead	 of	 mind	 because	 mind	 has	 become
associated	with	the	idea	that	it	is	only	the	process	of	thinking,	and	the	process	of
feeling	is	in	the	heart,	and	the	heart	is	deeper.
These	 ideas	 have	 been	 created	 by	 the	 poets.	 But	 the	 truth	 is,	 you	 can	 call	 it
empty	mind	or	you	can	call	it	empty	heart;	it	is	the	same.	Emptiness	--	you	are
just	 a	 watcher	 and	 all	 around	 there	 is	 nothing	 with	 which	 you	 are	 identified,
there	is	nothing	to	which	you	are	clinging.	This	non-clinging	watchfulness	is	the
empty	mind,	no-mind,	or	empty	heart.
These	are	simply	words.	The	real	thing	is	emptiness	--	of	all	thoughts,	feelings,
sentiments,	emotions.	Only	a	single	point	of	witnessing	remains.
And	 you	 will	 find	 it	 difficult.	 Disidentifying	 from	 thoughts	 is	 easier	 because
thoughts	are	more	superficial.	Disidentifying	from	the	feelings	is	a	little	difficult
because	 they	 are	 deeper,	 and	 they	 are	 rooted	 more	 in	 your	 biology,	 in	 your
chemistry,	in	your	hormones.
Thoughts	are	just	floating	clouds.	They	are	not	rooted	in	your	chemistry,	in	your
biology,	 in	 your	 physiology,	 in	 your	 hormones,	 they	 are	 just	 floating	 clouds
without	any	roots.	But	feelings	have	roots,	so	it	is	difficult	to	uproot	them.
It	is	easy	to	become	watchful	about	the	theory	of	relativity.	It	is	difficult	to	be	a
witness	of	your	anger,	your	love,	your	greed,	your	ambition.	The	reason	is	they
are	rooted	more	deeply	in	the	body.	But	if	you	can	disidentify	yourself	from	the
body,	there	is	no	difficulty.
And,	Maneesha,	being	a	woman	it	is	a	little	more	difficult.	There	are	differences
between	men	and	women....
Mulla	Nasruddin	was	 reading	his	 newspaper	 and	 suddenly	 called	his	wife	 and
said,	"I	have	caught	four	flies:	two	are	males	and	two	are	females."
The	wife	said,	"My	god,	how	did	you	manage	to	know	their	sex?"
He	said,	 "Easy!	Two	were	 reading	 the	newspaper	with	me	 for	hours.	And	 two
were	sitting	on	the	mirror,	completely	glued."
So	it	is	a	little	difficult.	But	witnessing	is	such	a	sharp	sword	--	it	cuts	thoughts,
feelings,	emotions,	in	a	single	blow.	And	you	know	it	by	experience	now:	as	you
go	 deeper	 in	 your	 meditation,	 the	 body	 is	 left	 far	 behind,	 the	 emotions,	 the
thoughts...	 only	 the	 witnessing	 remains.	 That	 is	 your	 authentic	 nature.	 The
emptiness	of	the	buddha's	heart...	when	you	are	so	empty,	you	are	one	with	the
Buddha.	You	are	one	with	all	the	buddhas	of	all	times,	past,	present,	future.
Question	2
Another	question:
BELOVED	MASTER,
RECENTLY,	 I	 SAID	 I	 FELT	 AWARE	 OF	 AN	 EMPTINESS	 INSIDE,	 AND
HOW
STRANGE	IT	WAS	TO	RELATE	TO	LIFE	FEELING	LIKE	THAT.	YOU
SUGGESTED	 I	 ACT	 ALL	 THOSE	 THINGS	 ONE	 HAS	 TO	 DO	 IN
EVERYDAY	LIFE.
WHEN	I	DON'T	REMEMBER	TO	ACT,	MOST	OF	MY	COMMUNICATION
WITH
PEOPLE	--	TO	A	GREATER	OR	LESSER	EXTENT	--	FEELS	SOMETHING
LIKE
ENGO'S	RAM	WITH	ITS	HORNS	ENTANGLED	IN	A	FENCE.
BUT,	 REMEMBERING	 TO	 ACT,	 I	 FEEL	 DISENGAGED	 FROM	 PEOPLE;
THERE	IS
A	DISTANCE	FROM	PEOPLE,	AND	SO	THEY	DON'T	AFFECT	ME.	YET
CURIOUSLY,	 THE	 BETTER	 I	 ACT	 AS	 IF	 I	 AM	 LOVING,	 THE	 MORE
LOVING	I	FEEL.
CAN	YOU	EXPLAIN	THIS?
It	 is	 part	 of	 hypnotizing	 yourself.	 This	 is	 an	 ancient	 strategy:	 "Act	 as	 if	 you
love."	That
"as	if"	will	be	forgotten	soon	and	you	will	start	thinking	that	you	love.	But	this
love	is	the	love	of	the	hypocrite.
I	don't	want	you	to	begin	with	"as	if."	Just	be	the	buddha	--	why	"as	if?"
Look	at	Sardar	Gurudayal	Singh.	Do	you	think	he	is	laughing	"as	if?"	This	is	a
spontaneity.	 I	 am	 not	 telling	 you	 to	 do	 anything	 as	 an	 actor.	 Be	 authentic,	 be
honest,	be	totally	sincere	whatever	the	consequence,	but	never	move	from	your
center	of	truthfulness.
Now	Gurudayal	Singh	has	 laughed	and	 I	have	 to	 tell	 a	 joke.	He	starts	 it	 and	 I
cannot	disappoint	him.
"What	are	those	two	insects	doing,	Daddy?"	asks	Little	Gertrude,	who	is	walking
around	the	garden	with	her	father.
"Well,"	mumbles	her	father,	"you	remember	what	I	told	you	about	the	birds	and
the	bees?
That's	what	they	are	doing."
"But	they	are	not	birds	and	bees,"	protests	Gertrude.
"I	know,"	says	her	father,	"they	are	called	Daddy	Long	Legs."
"Oh!"	says	Gertrude,	thinking	for	a	while.	"So	that	means,"	she	continues,	"that
the	one	underneath	is	a	Mommy	Long	Legs,	and	the	one	on	top	is	Daddy	Long
Legs."
"No,	it's	not	quite	like	that,	dear,"	replies	her	father,	"they	are	both	Daddy	Long
Legs."
Gertrude	thinks	again	for	a	moment,	and	then	stomps	on	the	insects.
"Why	did	you	do	that?"	asks	her	surprised	father.
"Why?"	repeats	Gertrude.	"I'm	not	having	that	sort	of	thing	in	my	garden!"
There	is	a	Saturday	night	shoot-out	in	the	O.K.	Saloon,	and	the	air	is	thick	with
lead	bullets.
Suddenly,	the	doors	swing	open,	and	in	walks	a	man	who	strides	straight	across
the	room	and	up	to	the	bar.	Immediately,	all	the	shooting	stops.
The	barman	pops	his	head	up	from	behind	the	counter.	"Friend,"	he	says,	"that
took	real	courage	to	walk	through	those	blazing	guns	without	even	looking	left
or	right!"
"Not	at	all,"	replies	the	man,	looking	around,	casually.	"You	see,	I	owe	money	to
everyone	here!"
Olga	Kowalski	comes	bouncing	enthusiastically	downstairs	in	her	new	Kung	Fu
outfit.
Kowalski	takes	one	look	at	her,	and	puts	his	hand	over	his	face.
"Good	God,	Olga!"	groans	Kowalski.	"Now	what	are	you	doing?"
"I'm	taking	Kung	Fu	lessons,"	says	Olga,	proudly	--	and	she	playfully	slices	the
air	with	her	hand,	giving	Kowalski	a	punch	on	the	neck.
"It	is	just	in	case,"	explains	Olga,	"some	sex-fiend	tries	to	rape	me	on	some	dark
night."
"Why	bother?"	remarks	Kowalski,	slurping	his	beer.	"It	will	never	get	that	dark!"
"And	 Miss	 Willing,	 is	 this	 the	 man,"	 screams	 the	 clever	 lawyer	 Boris
Babblebrain,	and	pointing,	"who	you	claim	has	violated	you,	and	forcibly	taken
advantage	of	your	hot,	naked,	helpless,	female	body?"
"Yes!	Yes!"	shouts	Miss	Willing,	excitedly.	"That	is	the	man	who	did	it	to	me!"
"And	 please	 tell	 the	 court,"	 continues	 Babblebrain,	 his	 nose	 in	 the	 air	 as	 he
strides	 over	 to	 the	 jury,	 "just	 when	 did	 this	 carnal	 and	 erotically	 perverse	 act
occur?"
"Yes,	sir,"	replies	Miss	Willing.	"As	I	remember,	it	was	last	June...	and	July,	and
August!"
Nivedano...
Nivedano...
Be	silent,	close	your	eyes.
Let	your	body	be	completely	frozen.
Look	inwards,	just	as	a	witness.
The	mind	is	there,	the	body	is	there,	but	you	are	neither	the	mind	nor	the	body.
You	are	 just	a	watcher,	a	pure	witness.	This	witnessing	 is	 the	way	 to	your	 life
sources.
The	 deeper	 witnessing	 becomes,	 the	 farther	 away	 is	 the	 mind,	 the	 body;	 the
deeper	you	go,	the	closer	you	come	to	an	illumination,	to	an	explosion	of	light.
Suddenly	you	recognize,	you	are	a	buddha.
All	around	is	emptiness.	Just	at	the	center
you	are	the	buddha,	the	watcher.
Nivedano...
Relax,	to	make	it	completely	clear	that	the	body	is	separate,	the	mind	is	separate,
you	are	only	the	witness.	In	life,	in	death,	everywhere	you	are	a	witness.
This	witness	never	dies.
It	is	your	eternity.
This	is	your	buddha.
Remember	it	--	you	have	only	forgotten.
It	 is	 not	 an	 achievement,	 it	 is	 just	 a	 remembrance.	Hence	 it	 is	 easy	 to	 carry	 it
around	the	clock	doing	all	kinds	of	things,	actions,	gestures...	you	can	still	allow
a	small	stream	of	remembrance	that	you	are	a	buddha.	But	remember	it	is	not	às
if'.
The	buddha	is	your	authentic	nature.
Nivedano...
Come	 back,	 but	 don't	 come	 the	 way	 you	 have	 gone	 in.	 Come	 with	 a	 new
grandeur,	with	 a	 new	 grace,	with	 a	 new	 bliss...	with	 a	 taste	 of	 your	 authentic
nature.
You	 have	 been	 to	 your	 own	 roots	 and	 those	 roots	 go	 deep	 down	 into	 the
universe.	 Now	 you	 are	 becoming	 acquainted	 with	 the	 path...	 it	 will	 become
deeper	 every	 day,	more	 and	more,	 as	 you	 gather	 courage,	 as	 you	 start	 feeling
more	peace,	more	silence,	more	transformation.
Your	remembrance	of	being	a	buddha	will	continue,	sitting,	walking,	waking	or
sleeping.
This	is	the	greatest	treasure	you	can	find	in	the	universe	--	this	empty	heart	of	the
buddha.
Okay,	Maneesha?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.
Can	we	celebrate	the	buddhas'	gathering?
Yes!
