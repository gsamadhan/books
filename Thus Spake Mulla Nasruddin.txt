CHAPTER 2
Living is love
10 October 1970
[The following is a poem in Osho’s handwriting, which he wrote specially for this booklet of poems
by Rati Sett.]
LIVING IS LOVE
when gladness glides
in the deep lake of silence,
warm breath of love
hums an unheard song.
when open sky is wide awake
under thy gaze
fog of doubt melts away
and, fragrant breeze reveals
the sweet pollen of bliss.
the lake, the lotus
and the unseen lover
