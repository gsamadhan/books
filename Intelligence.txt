ntel l igence is intr insic to life. Inte l l igence is a natural qual i ty of life. 
Just as fire is h o t a n d air is invisible and wa te r flows d o w n w a r d , so is 
life intel l igent . 
Inte l l igence is n o t an ach ievement . 
You are born in tel l igent . Trees are in te l l i ­
gen t in the i r o w n way, they have e n o u g h 
inte l l igence for the i r o w n life. Birds are i n ­
tel l igent , so are animals. In fact, w h a t re l i ­
g ions m e a n by G o d i s on ly t h i s—tha t t he 
universe is intel l igent , tha t there is in te l l i ­
gence h i d d e n eve rywhere . A n d i f y o u have 
eyes to see, y o u can see i t eve rywhe re . Life 
is intel l igence. 
O n l y m a n has b e c o m e un in te l l igen t . 
M a n has d a m a g e d the natural flow of 
life. Excep t in m a n , there is no unin te l l i -
gence. Have you ever seen a b i rd you can 
call stupid? Have you ever seen an animal 
y o u can call idiotic? N o , such things h a p p e n 
only to m a n . Some th ing has gone w r o n g . 
M a n ' s intell igence has been damaged, co r rup ted , has b e e n crippled.

A n d med i t a t i on i s n o t h i n g b u t the u n d o i n g o f that damage . M e d i t a ­
t i on wi l l n o t be n e e d e d at all i f m a n is left a lone. If the pr iest and the 
pol i t ic ian do n o t interfere w i t h man ' s intel l igence, there wil l be no n e e d 
for any med i t a t ion . M e d i t a t i o n is medic ina l first y o u have to create the 
disease, t h e n med i t a t i on is needed . If the disease is n o t there , med i t a t i on 
is n o t needed . A n d it is n o t accidental that the words medicine and medita­
t ion c o m e f rom the same root . I t is medic ina l . 
Each chi ld i s b o r n intel l igent , and the m o m e n t the chi ld i s b o r n , we 
p o u n c e u p o n h i m and start des t roying his intel l igence, because in te l l i ­
gence is dangerous to the poli t ical s t ructure , to the social s t ructure , to the 
religious s t ructure . It is dangerous to the pope , it is dangerous to the priest, 
i t is dangerous to the leader. I t is dangerous to the status q u o , the es tab­
l ishment . Intel l igence is naturally rebell ious. Intel l igence c a n n o t be forced 
i n t o any servi tude . Inte l l igence is ve ry assertive, individual . Inte l l igence 
c a n n o t be forced in to a mechan ica l imi ta t ion . 
Peop le have to be conve r t ed to ca rbon copies; the i r or ig inal i ty has to 
be destroyed, o the rwise all t he nonsense that has exis ted on the ear th 
w o u l d be impossible . You n e e d a leader because first y o u have b e e n m a d e 
u n i n t e l l i g e n t — o t h e r w i s e the re w o u l d b e n o n e e d for any leader. W h y 
shou ld y o u fol low anybody? You wil l fol low y o u r inte l l igence. I f s o m e ­
b o d y wants to b e c o m e a leader, t h e n o n e t h i n g has to be d o n e : Your i n ­
tel l igence has to be destroyed somehow. You have to be shaken f rom y o u r 
v e r y roots , y o u have to be m a d e afraid. You have to be m a d e uncon f iden t 
in yourse l f—tha t i s a mus t . O n l y t h e n can the leader c o m e in . 
I f y o u are in te l l igent , y o u wil l solve y o u r p rob lems yourself. In te l l i ­
gence is e n o u g h to solve all the p rob lems . In fact, wha t soeve r p rob lems 
are created in life, y o u have m o r e inte l l igence t h a n those p rob lems . It is a 
provis ion, i t i s a gift of na ture . B u t there are ambi t ious p e o p l e w h o w a n t 
to rule , d o m i n a t e ; there are ambi t ious m a d m e n — t h e y create fear in you . 
Fear is like rust: I t destroys all intel l igence. If y o u w a n t to destroy s o m e ­
body ' s intel l igence, the first t h i n g n e e d e d is to create fear: Crea te hell and 
m a k e p e o p l e afraid. W h e n peop le are afraid o f hell , they wi l l go and b o w 
d o w n to the priest . T h e y wi l l l isten to the priest . I f they d o n ' t l isten to 
I n t e l l i g e n c e - A G i f t o f N a t u r e 
the pr ies t t h e n they wi l l face hel l f i re—natural ly they are afraid. T h e y 
have to p ro tec t themselves f rom hellfire, and the priest i s needed . T h e 
pr iest b e c o m e s a mus t . 
I have heard abou t t w o m e n w h o 
were par tners in a business. T h e i r business 
was ve ry u n i q u e and they used to travel 
a round the count ry . O n e pa r tne r w o u l d 
go in to a t o w n , and in the n igh t he w o u l d 
go a r o u n d and t h r o w coal tar on people ' s 
w i n d o w s , and then disappear by m o r n i n g . 
After t w o or three days, the o t h e r w o u l d 
c o m e . He w o u l d offer to clean the coal tar 
f rom people ' s w i n d o w s . A n d p e o p l e 
w o u l d pay, of c o u r s e — t h e y had to pay. 
T h e y were par tners in the same business. 
O n e w o u l d d o the damage , the o t h e r 
w o u l d c o m e t o u n d o it. 
Fear has to be created, and greed has to be created. Inte l l igence is n o t 
greedy. You wil l be surpr ised to k n o w that an in te l l igent m a n is never 
greedy. G r e e d is par t of un in te l l igence . You h o a r d for t o m o r r o w because 
you are n o t conf ident that t o m o r r o w y o u wil l be able to tackle y o u r life, 
o therwise w h y hoard? You b e c o m e misers , you b e c o m e greedy, because 
y o u d o n ' t k n o w w h e t h e r t o m o r r o w y o u r intel l igence wi l l b e capable o f 
c o p i n g w i t h life o r no t . W h o knows? You are n o t conf iden t ab o u t y o u r 
inte l l igence so y o u hoard , y o u b e c o m e greedy. An inte l l igent p e r s o n i s 
n o t afraid, is n o t greedy. 
G r e e d and fear go t oge the r—tha t ' s w h y heaven and hell go together . 
He l l is fear, heaven is greed. Crea te fear in peop le and create g reed in 
p e o p l e — m a k e t h e m as g reedy as possible. M a k e t h e m so g reedy that life 
c a n n o t satisfy t h e m , t h e n they wi l l go to the pr iest and to t he leader. 
T h e n they wil l start fantasizing abou t some future life w h e r e their foolish 
desires and s tupid fantasies wi l l be fulfilled. W a t c h i t — t o d e m a n d the i m ­
possible is to be unin te l l igent .

An intel l igent person is perfectly satisfied w i t h the possible. He 
works for the probable ; he never works for the impossible and the i m ­
probable , n o . He looks at life and its l imi ta t ions . He is n o t a perfect ionist . 
A perfect ionist is neuro t ic . If you are a perfect ionist y o u wi l l b e c o m e 
neuro t ic . 
For example , i f y o u love a w o m a n and y o u ask absolute fidelity, y o u 
wil l go m a d and she wi l l go mad . T h i s i s n o t possible. Abso lu te fidelity 
means she wi l l n o t even th ink , she wi l l n o t even d r e a m o f a n o t h e r m a n — 
this i s n o t possible. W h o are you? W h y has she fallen in love w i t h you? 
Because y o u are a m a n . I f she can fall in love w i t h you , w h y can ' t she 
t h i n k o f others? T h a t possibility remains o p e n . A n d h o w i s she g o i n g to 
m a n a g e if she sees some beaut i ful pe r son w a l k i n g by and a desire arises in 
her? E v e n to say " T h i s m a n is beaut i fu l" is to de s i r e—the desire has e n ­
tered . You on ly say that s o m e t h i n g is beautiful w h e n y o u feel i t is w o r t h y 
of b e i n g possessed, o f b e i n g enjoyed. You are n o t indifferent. 
N o w i f y o u ask absolute fidelity—as p e o p l e have a s k e d — t h e n there 
i s b o u n d to be conflict, and you wi l l r e m a i n suspicious. A n d y o u wi l l r e ­
m a i n suspicious because y o u k n o w y o u r m i n d , t o o — y o u t h i n k o f o t h e r 
w o m e n , so h o w can y o u t rust that y o u r w o m a n i s n o t t h i n k i n g o f o t h e r 
m e n ? You k n o w w h a t y o u are t h ink ing , so y o u k n o w she i s t h i n k i n g the 
same th ings . N o w distrust arises, conflict, agony. T h e love that was poss i ­
ble has b e c o m e impossible because of an impossible desire. 
Peop le ask that w h i c h c a n n o t be d o n e . You w a n t secur i ty for the fu ­
ture , w h i c h i s n o t possible. You w a n t absolute secur i ty for t o m o r r o w — i t 
c a n n o t be guaranteed; i t i s n o t in t he na ture of life. An inte l l igent pe r son 
k n o w s that i t i s n o t in the na ture of life. T h e future remains o p e n — t h e 
b a n k can go b a n k r u p t , the wife can escape w i t h s o m e b o d y else, the h u s ­
b a n d can die, the ch i ld ren m a y prove u n w o r t h y . W h o k n o w s ab o u t t o ­
m o r r o w ? You m a y fall ill, you m a y b e c o m e cr ippled . W h o k n o w s abou t 
t o m o r r o w ? 
To ask secur i ty for t o m o r r o w means to r e m a i n in cons tan t fear. S e ­
cur i ty is n o t possible, so w h e n y o u are afraid of insecuri ty, y o u r fear c a n ­
n o t be destroyed. Fear wil l be there , y o u wi l l be t r e m b l i n g — a n d 
I n t e l l i g e n c e A G i l t o f N a t u r e 
m e a n w h i l e the present m o m e n t i s b e i n g missed. W i t h the desire for se ­
cur i ty in t he fu ture y o u are des t roying the present , w h i c h is the on ly life 
available. A n d m o r e and m o r e wi l l y o u b e c o m e shaken, afraid, greedy. 
A chi ld is b o r n ; a chi ld is a very, v e r y o p e n p h e n o m e n o n , u t te r ly i n ­
tel l igent . B u t w e j u m p u p o n h i m , w e start des t roying his inte l l igence. W e 
start c rea t ing fear in h i m . You call i t t each ing , y o u call i t m a k i n g the chi ld 
capable of c o p i n g w i t h life. He is unafraid, and you create fear in h i m . 
A n d y o u r schools, colleges, un ivers i t i es—they all m a k e h i m m o r e 
and m o r e un in te l l igen t . T h e y d e m a n d foolish th ings . T h e y d e m a n d fool­
ish th ings to be m e m o r i z e d , th ings in w h i c h the chi ld and his natural i n ­
tel l igence c a n n o t see any p o i n t . For wha t? T h a t child c a n n o t see the 
po in t . W h y c ram these th ings i n t o his head? B u t the univers i ty says, the 
col lege says, the h o m e , t he family, t he wel l -wishers say, " C r a m ! You d o n ' t 
k n o w now, bu t later on y o u wi l l k n o w w h y i t i s needed . " 
C r a m history, all the nonsense that peop le have b e e n d o i n g to o t h e r 
peop le , all t he madnes s—s tudy it! A n d the child c a n n o t see the p o i n t . 
W h a t does i t ma t t e r w h e n a cer ta in k i n g ru l ed Eng land , f rom w h a t date 
to w h a t date? B u t he has to m e m o r i z e those s tupid th ings . Natural ly, his 
in te l l igence b e c o m e s m o r e and m o r e b u r d e n e d , c r ippled . M o r e and m o r e 
dust collects on his intel l igence. By the t i m e a pe r son comes back f rom 
the university, he is u n i n t e l l i g e n t — t h e universi ty has d o n e its j o b . I t is 
v e r y rare that s o m e o n e can gradua te f rom the universi ty and still r e m a i n 
inte l l igent . Very few peop le have b e e n able to escape the university, to 
avoid it, pass t h r o u g h the univers i ty a n d yet save the i r i n t e l l i gence—very 
rarely. It is such a great m e c h a n i s m to destroy you. 
T h e m o m e n t y o u b e c o m e educa ted , y o u have b e c o m e unin te l l igen t . 
Can't you see this? The educated person behaves very 
unintelligently. Go to the primitive people who have never 
been educated, and you will find a pure intelligence functioning. 
I have heard . . . 
A w o m a n was t r y ing to open a t in , and she could no t figure 
ou t h o w to do it. So she w e n t to look in the c o o k b o o k . By the 
5 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
t ime she looked i n t o the b o o k , the c o o k h a d o p e n e d it. She 
came back, and she was surpr ised. She asked the cook , " H o w did 
you d o i t?" 
H e said, "Lady, w h e n y o u d o n ' t k n o w h o w t o read, y o u have 
to use y o u r in te l l igence!" 
Yes, i t i s r igh t . W h e n y o u d o n ' t k n o w h o w to read y o u have to use 
y o u r intel l igence. W h a t else can you do? T h e m o m e n t y o u start r e a d i n g — 
those three dangerous R s , w h e n you have b e c o m e capable i n t h e m — y o u 
n e e d n o t be in te l l igent , the books wi l l take care of it. 
Have y o u w a t c h e d it? W h e n a pe r son starts typing, his h a n d w r i t i n g is 
lost; t h e n his h a n d w r i t i n g i s no l onge r beautiful . T h e r e i s no need: T h e 
typewr i t e r takes care of it. I f you car ry a calculator in y o u r pocke t , y o u 
wil l forget all m a t h e m a t i c s — t h e r e is no need. S o o n e r or later eve rybody 
wil l be ca r ry ing small c o m p u t e r s . T h e y wi l l have all the i n fo rma t ion of 
an Encyclopaedia Britannica, and t h e n there wi l l be no n e e d for you to be 
intel l igent at all; the c o m p u t e r wil l take care of it. 
Go to the pr imi t ive people , the u n e d u c a t e d people , the villagers, and 
you wil l f ind a subtle intell igence. Yes, they are n o t ve ry in fo rmed , that is 
t rue . T h e y are n o t knowledgeable , that i s t r u e — b u t they are t r emendous ly 
intell igent. T h e i r intel l igence is like a f lame w i t h no s m o k e a round it. 
T h e society has d o n e someth ing w r o n g w i t h the h u m a n b e i n g — f o r 
cer ta in reasons. I t wan t s y o u to be slaves, i t wan t s y o u to be always afraid. 
I t wants y o u to be always greedy, i t wants y o u to be always ambi t ious , i t 
wan t s y o u to be always compet i t ive . I t wan t s y o u to be un lov ing , i t 
wants y o u to be full o f anger and hatred. I t wants y o u to r ema in weak , 
im i t a t i ve—carbon copies . I t does n o t w a n t y o u to b e c o m e or ig ina l and 
u n i q u e and rebel l ious, no . Tha t ' s w h y y o u r in te l l igence has b e e n d e ­
stroyed. 
M e d i t a t i o n i s n e e d e d on ly to u n d o w h a t the society has done . M e d ­
i tat ion is negative: It s imply negates the damage , it destroys the illness. 
A n d once the illness has gone , y o u r w e l l - b e i n g asserts itself of its o w n ac­

I n t e l l I g e n c e — A G i f t o f N a t u r e 
In the last c e n t u r y i t has g o n e too far: Universal educa t ion has b e e n 
a calamity. A n d r e m e m b e r , I am n o t against educa t ion , I am against this 
educa t ion . T h e r e is a possibility of a differ­
en t k i n d o f educa t ion w h i c h wil l be h e l p ­

des t roying it; w h i c h wil l n o t b u r d e n i t

T h i s educa t ion on ly makes y o u capa­

uca t ion destroys y o u r inventiveness. T h a t 
educa t ion will help y o u to b e c o m e m o r e 
inventive. 
For example , t he educa t i on that I 
w o u l d like in the w o r l d wil l n o t requ i re a 
chi ld to answer in the old s te reo typed way. 
I t wi l l n o t encourage repet i t ion , pa r ro t ing . 
I t will encourage inventiveness. Even if t he 
inven ted answer is n o t as r igh t as the c o p i e d answer can be , still i t wi l l a p ­
preciate the child w h o has b r o u g h t a n e w answer to an old p r o b l e m . C e r ­
tainly the child's answer c a n n o t be as r igh t as Socrates ' answer—natural ly , 
a small child's answer c a n n o t be as exact as that of Alber t Eins te in . B u t to 
ask that the child's answer shou ld be as r igh t as that of Albe r t Eins te in is 
foolish. I f the chi ld is inventive, he or she is m o v i n g in t h e r igh t d i r ec ­
t ion; o n e day the chi ld wi l l b e c o m e an Albe r t Eins te in . I f he i s t r y ing to

t r y ing to create s o m e t h i n g n e w shou ld be appreciated, shou ld be praised. 
E d u c a t i o n shou ld n o t be compet i t ive . Peop le should n o t be j u d g e d 
against each other . Compet i t iveness is ve ry v io len t and v e r y destruct ive.

A real educa t ion wil l help peop le to find their life w h e r e they can be

perfectly good . T h e r e i s no n e e d to b e c o m e a pres ident or a p r i m e m i n ­

"I t ' s t rue , " said the storekeeper, " tha t P ier re is expensive, bu t 
he has a sexy quali ty in his call that no moose can resist."

"Wel l , " said the o ther , "P i e r r e will spot a moose at th ree

y o u d o n ' t k n o w w h o y o u are, y o u wi l l always be i n some a c c i d e n t —

s o m e b o d y else's door ; h e n c e d i sconten t , dullness, b o r e d o m , anguish. 
An inte l l igent p e r s o n wil l t r y jus t to be himself, wha t soeve r the cost. 
An inte l l igent pe r son wi l l never copy, wil l never imitate . He wi l l never 
par ro t . An inte l l igent pe r son wi l l l isten to his o w n in t r ins ic call. He wi l l 
feel his o w n b e i n g and m o v e accordingly, wha t soeve r the risk. 
T h e r e i s risk! W h e n you copy o thers there i s less risk. W h e n y o u 
d o n ' t copy anybody y o u are a l o n e — t h e r e is risk! B u t life happens on ly to 
those w h o live dangerously. Life happens on ly to those w h o are adven­
turous , w h o are courageous , a lmost da redev i l s—only to t h e m does life 
happen . Life does n o t h a p p e n to l u k e w a r m peop le . 
Inte l l igence is t rust in y o u r o w n be ing . In te l l igence is adventure , 
thril l , joy. In te l l igence is to live in this m o ­
m e n t , n o t to h a n k e r for the future. In te l l i ­
gence i s n o t to t h i n k of the past and n o t to 
b o t h e r abou t the f u t u r e — t h e past i s no 
m o r e , the fu ture is n o t yet . Intel l igence is 
t o m a k e the u t m o s t use o f the present m o ­
m e n t that i s available. T h e future wil l 
c o m e ou t o f it. I f this m o m e n t has b e e n 
lived in del ight and joy, t he nex t m o m e n t is 
g o i n g to be b o r n ou t o f it. I t wil l b r i n g 
m o r e j o y naturally, b u t the re i s no n e e d to

wil l g r o w o u t o f today. 
If this life has b e e n a bened ic t ion , my 
nex t life wi l l be a h i g h e r bened ic t i on . 
F r o m w h e r e can i t come? I t wi l l g r o w ou t 
of m e , ou t of my lived exper ience . So an 
intell igent person is n o t conce rned about heaven and hell, is n o t c o n c e r n e d 
abou t the afterlife, i s n o t c o n c e r n e d even abou t G o d , i s n o t c o n c e r n e d 
Intelligence A Gift of Nature 
even abou t the soul. An inte l l igent pe r son simply lives intelligently, a n d 
G o d and the soul and heaven and n i rvana all follow naturally. 
You live in belief; bel ief is un in te l l igent . Live t h r o u g h k n o w i n g ; 
k n o w i n g is intel l igence. A n d inte l l igence is med i ta t ion . 
Un in t e l l i gen t peop le also medi ta te , bu t certainly they medi t a t e in an 
un in te l l igen t way. T h e y t h i n k that y o u have to go to the c h u r c h every 
Sunday for o n e h o u r — t h a t h o u r i s to be g iven to rel igion. T h i s i s an u n ­
inte l l igent way to be related to re l ig ion. W h a t has t he c h u r c h to do w i t h 
it? Your real life is in the six days. Sunday is n o t y o u r real day. You wil l 
live nonre l ig ious ly for six days, and t h e n y o u go to the c h u r c h jus t for 
o n e o r t w o hours? W h o m are y o u t r y i n g t o deceive? T r y i n g t o deceive 
G o d that you are a c h u r c h g o e r . . . 
O r , i f you t r y a little harder , t h e n every day for t w e n t y minu te s in the 
m o r n i n g , t w e n t y in the evening, you do t ranscendenta l med i t a t ion . You 
sit w i t h closed eyes and y o u repeat a m a n t r a in a v e r y stupid w a y — " O m , 
O m , O m " — w h i c h dulls the m i n d even m o r e . T o repeat a m a n t r a m e ­
chanical ly takes y o u r inte l l igence away. I t does n o t give y o u intel l igence, 
it is like a lullaby. 
D o w n the centur ies , m o t h e r s have k n o w n this. W h e n e v e r a chi ld i s 
restless and does n o t w a n t to go to sleep, the m o t h e r comes and sings a 
lullaby. T h e child feels bo red , and the chi ld c a n n o t escape. W h e r e to go? 
T h e m o t h e r i s h o l d i n g h i m on the bed . T h e on ly way to escape i s in 
sleep. So he goes to sleep; he s imply sur renders . He says, " I t is foolish to 
be awake now, because she is d o i n g such a b o r i n g th ing , she goes on r e ­
pea t ing jus t a single l ine." 
T h e r e are stories that m o t h e r s and g r a n d m o t h e r s tell to ch i ld ren 
w h e n they d o n ' t go to sleep. I f y o u l ook in to these stories, y o u wi l l f ind 
a cer ta in pa t t e rn of cons tan t repe t i t ion . Just the o the r day I was read ing a 
s tory to ld by a g r a n d m o t h e r to a small chi ld w h o does n o t w a n t to go to 
sleep, because he does n o t feel l ike sleeping r ight now. His intel l igence says 
that he is perfectiy awake, b u t t he g r a n d m o t h e r is forcing h i m . She has 
o the r th ings to d o — t h e child i s n o t i m p o r t a n t . 
C h i l d r e n are v e r y puzzled, th ings l ook ve ry absurd. W h e n they w a n t 
11 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
12 
t o sleep i n t he m o r n i n g , eve rybody wants t o wake t h e m up . W h e n they 
d o n ' t w a n t to go to sleep, eve rybody i s forc ing t h e m to sleep. T h e y b e ­
c o m e v e r y puzzled. W h a t i s the ma t t e r w i t h these people? W h e n sleep 
comes , g o o d — t h a t is intel l igence. W h e n i t is n o t c o m i n g , i t is perfectly 
good to be awake. 
So this old g r a n d m o t h e r is tel l ing a story. At first the chi ld remains 
interested, bu t by and by . . . A n y intel l igent child will feel bored , only a 
s tupid child will n o t feel bored . 
T h e s tory is: 
A m a n goes to sleep and dreams that he is s tanding before a great 
palace. A n d in the palace there are o n e thousand and o n e rooms . So he 
goes from o n e r o o m to a n o t h e r — o n e thousand r o o m s — t h e n he reaches 
the last r o o m . A n d there is a beautiful bed, so he falls on the bed , falls 
asleep and dreams . . . that he is s tanding at the d o o r of a b ig palace 
w h i c h has o n e thousand and o n e rooms. So he goes in to o n e thousand 
rooms , t h e n he reaches t he o n e t h o u s a n d and first r o o m . Aga in there is a 
beautiful bed , so he goes to sleep . . . and dreams that he is s tanding b e ­
fore a palace. . . . T h i s is the way it goes! 
N o w , h o w l o n g can the chi ld r e m a i n alert? Just o u t o f sheer b o r e ­
d o m the chi ld falls asleep. He i s saying, " N o w be f inished!" 
A mant ra does the same. You repeat, " R a m , R a m . . . O m , Om . . . A l ­
lah, A l l a h " — o r anything. You go on repeating, you go on repeating. N o w 
you are do ing two jobs : b o t h the g randmother ' s and the child's. Your in te l ­
ligence is like the child, and your learning of the man t ra is like the g rand­
mother . T h e child tries to stop you, gets interested in o ther things, thinks of 
beautiful things—beautiful w o m e n , beautiful scenes. B u t you catch h i m 
red -handed and b r i n g h i m again t o " O m , O m , O m . " B y and by, your inner 
child feels that it is futile to struggle; the inner child goes to sleep. 
Yes, t he m a n t r a can give y o u a cer ta in sleep: I t is an au t o h y p n o t i c 
sleep. T h e r e is n o t h i n g w r o n g in i t i f sleep is difficult for y o u — i f y o u 
suffer f rom in somnia i t is good. B u t i t has n o t h i n g to do w i t h spirituality; 
it is a v e r y un in te l l igen t way to medi ta te . 
T h e n w h a t i s the in te l l igent way to medi ta te? T h e inte l l igent way i s 
Intelligence A Gift of Nature 
to b r i n g inte l l igence in to eve ry th ing that y o u do . Walk ing , walk in te l l i ­
gently, w i t h awareness. Eat ing , eat intelligently, w i t h awareness. Do y o u 
r e m e m b e r ever ea t ing intel l igently? Ever t h i n k i n g abou t w h a t y o u are 
eating? Is i t nutr i t ious? Has i t any nu t r i t iona l value, or are y o u jus t stuff­
ing yourself w i t h o u t any n o u r i s h m e n t ? 
H a v e you ever w a t c h e d w h a t y o u do? You g o o n s m o k i n g . T h e n i n ­
tell igence is n e e d e d — w h a t are y o u doing? Just t ak ing in s m o k e and 
t h r o w i n g i t ou t , and m e a n w h i l e des t roying y o u r lungs. A n d w h a t are y o u 
really do ing? Was t ing money , wast ing heal th . B r i n g inte l l igence in w h i l e 
you are s m o k i n g , w h i l e y o u are eat ing. B r i n g intel l igence in w h e n y o u 
go and m a k e love t o y o u r w o m a n o r t o y o u r m a n . W h a t are you do ing? 
Have y o u really any love? Somet imes y o u m a k e love ou t o f habi t . T h e n 
i t is ugly, t h e n i t is i m m o r a l . Love has to be ve ry conscious , on ly t h e n i t 
b e c o m e s prayer. 
W h i l e m a k i n g love t o y o u r w o m a n , w h a t exactly are y o u doing? U s ­
i n g the w o m a n ' s b o d y t o t h r o w some energy that has b e c o m e t o o m u c h 
for you? Or are y o u pay ing respect, are y o u lov ing to the w o m a n , do y o u 
have some reverence for the w o m a n ? 
I d o n ' t see it. H u s b a n d s d o n ' t respect their wives, they use t h e m . 
Wives use their husbands , they d o n ' t respect t h e m . I f reverence does n o t 
arise ou t of love, t h e n inte l l igence is miss ing somewhere . O t h e r w i s e you 
wi l l feel t r emendous ly grateful to the other , and y o u r l ovemak ing wi l l 
b e c o m e a great med i ta t ion .

Inte l l igence has to spread all over y o u r life. It is n o t a Sunday th ing , 
and y o u c a n n o t do i t for t w e n t y m i n u t e s and t h e n forget ab o u t it. I n t e l ­

An inte l l igent p e r s o n wi l l m a k e his or he r life in such a way that i t

If y o u are wast ing y o u r life, i t is n o b o d y else's responsibility.

T h e inte l l igence of the head is n o t in te l l igence at all; i t is k n o w l e d g e a b i l -

there is. T h e head is s imply an accumula to r . It is always old, it is never 
15 
I N T E L L I G E N C E

new, it is never or ig ina l . It is g o o d for cer ta in purposes : For filing it is 
perfecdy good! A n d in life o n e needs t h i s — m a n y things have to be r e ­
m e m b e r e d . T h e m i n d , t he head, i s a b i o c o m p u t e r . You can go on 
accumula t ing k n o w l e d g e in i t and w h e n e v e r y o u n e e d i t you can take i t 
ou t . It is good for mathemat ics , good for 
calculat ion, g o o d for the day- to -day life, 
the marketp lace . B u t i f y o u t h i n k this is 
y o u r w h o l e life t h e n y o u wi l l r e m a i n s tu­
pid. You wil l never k n o w the beau ty o f

ings of the hear t . You wil l never k n o w the 
grace that descends on ly t h r o u g h the hear t , 
the godliness that en ters only t h r o u g h the 
hear t . You wil l never k n o w prayer, you 
wi l l never k n o w poet ry , you wi l l never 
k n o w love. 
T h e inte l l igence of the hea r t creates 
p o e t r y in y o u r life, gives a dance to y o u r 
steps, makes y o u r life a joy, a celebrat ion, a 
festivity, a laughter . It gives you a sense of 
h u m o r . I t makes y o u capable of love, of shar ing. T h a t is t r u e life. T h e life 
that is l ived f rom the head is a mechan ica l life. You b e c o m e a r o b o t — 
m a y b e v e r y efficient. R o b o t s are ve ry efficient, mach ines are m o r e effi­
c ient t h a n m a n . You can earn m u c h t h r o u g h the head, b u t you wi l l n o t

any life. 
Life is of the hear t . Life can on ly g r o w t h r o u g h the hear t . I t is the 
soil of the hear t w h e r e love grows, life grows, spirit grows. All that is 
beautiful , all tha t is really valuable, all that is mean ingfu l , significant, 
comes t h r o u g h the hear t . T h e hear t i s y o u r ve ry center , the head i s jus t 
y o u r per iphery . To live in the head is to live on the c i rcumference w i t h 
ou t ever b e c o m i n g aware of the beauties and the treasures of t he center . 
To live on the p e r i p h e r y is stupidity. 
To live in the head is stupidity. To live in the hear t and use the head 
w h e n e v e r i t is n e e d e d is in te l l igence. B u t the center , the master , is at the 
very core o f y o u r be ing . 
T h e mas te r is the hear t , and the head is j u s t a se rvan t—this is in te l l i ­
gence. W h e n the head b e c o m e s the mas ter and forgets all ab o u t the hear t , 
that is stupidity. 
It is up to y o u to choose. R e m e m b e r , the head as a slave is a b e a u t i ­
ful slave, of m u c h utility. B u t as a mas te r it is a dangerous mas ter and wi l l 
destroy y o u r w h o l e life, wi l l p o i s o n y o u r w h o l e life. L o o k around! P e o ­
ple's lives are absolutely po i soned , p o i s o n e d by the head. T h e y c a n n o t 
feel, they are no l onge r sensitive, n o t h i n g thrills t h e m . T h e sun rises b u t 
n o t h i n g rises in t h e m ; they l ook a t t he sun e m p t y - e y e d . T h e sky b e c o m e s 
full of the s tars—the marve l , t he m y s t e r y ! — b u t n o t h i n g stirs in the i r 
hearts , no song arises. Birds s i n g — m a n has fo rgo t ten to sing. C l o u d s 
c o m e in the sky and the peacocks dance, and m a n does n o t k n o w h o w to 
dance. He has b e c o m e a cr ipple . Trees b l o o m — a n d m a n th inks , never 
feels, and w i t h o u t feeling there is no f lower ing possible. 
Watch , scrut inize, observe, have a n o t h e r l ook a t y o u r life. N o b o d y 
else is g o i n g to help you . You have d e p e n d e d on o thers so long; that 's 
w h y y o u have b e c o m e stupid. N o w , take care; i t i s y o u r o w n responsibi l ­

are d o i n g w i t h y o u r life. Is the re any p o e t r y in y o u r heart? If i t is n o t

the re any romance in y o u r life or no t? I f there i s no t , t h e n y o u are already 
in y o u r grave.

T h e real intel l igence is of the hear t . I t is n o t in te l lectual , i t is e m o ­

Love i s available on ly to those w h o go on sha rpen ing the i r in te l l i ­

T h e un in te l l igen t p e r s o n may b e c o m e a great in te l lectual . In fact u n i n ­
tel l igent peop le t ry to b e c o m e intellectuals; that i s their way of h i d i n g 
their un in te l l igence . Love is n o t for the inte l lectual . Love needs a total ly 
different k ind of t a l en t—a ta len ted hear t , n o t a ta len ted head. 
Love has its o w n intel l igence, its o w n way of seeing, perceiving, its 
o w n way of u n d e r s t a n d i n g life, its o w n way of c o m p r e h e n d i n g the m y s ­
t e ry of existence. T h e p o e t i s far closer to i t t h a n the phi losopher . A n d 
the mystic i s exactly inside the t emp le . T h e p o e t i s on the steps and the 
ph i lo sophe r i s j u s t outs ide. At the m o s t he can approach the driveway, bu t 
never the steps. H e goes o n r o u n d and r o u n d . H e goes o n m o v i n g a r o u n d 
the t emp le , s tudy ing the ou te r walls o f the t emple , a n d b e c o m e s so e n ­
c h a n t e d that he forgets comple t e ly that the o u t e r walls are n o t the real 
t e m p l e and that the dei ty is inside. 
T h e p o e t reaches the door, b u t the door is so beautiful that he becomes 
hypnot ized. He thinks he has a r r ived— 
w h a t m o r e can there be? T h e phi losopher i s 
lost in guessing w h a t is inside. He never 
goes there, he simply thinks, philosophizes. 
T h e poe t tries to penetra te in to the mystery 
bu t gets h o o k e d near the door. T h e mystic 
enters in to the ve ry i n n e r m o s t sanc tum of 
the temple . 
T h e way is love, a n d the way is a l ov ­
ing intel l igence. W h e n love and in te l l i ­
gence m e e t t oge the r y o u create the space 
in w h i c h all tha t is possible to a h u m a n b e ­
i n g can b e c o m e actual . A lov ing in te l l i ­
gence is w h a t is needed . Inte l l igence alone 
b e c o m e s intel lectual , love a lone b e c o m e s 
sentimentali ty, bu t a lov ing intel l igence 
never b e c o m e s intel lectual i ty or sentimentali ty. I t gives y o u a n e w k ind 
of integri ty, a n e w crystall ization.

A N O P E N N E S S O F BEING 
Intel l igence is jus t an openness of be ing—capac i t y to see w i t h o u t p re ju ­
dice, capacity to listen w i t h o u t interference, capacity to be w i t h th ings 
w i t h o u t any a p r i o r i ideas abou t t h e m — t h a t ' s w h a t inte l l igence is. I n t e l ­
l igence is an openness of be ing . 
Tha t ' s w h y i t is so u t te r ly different f rom intellectuality. In te l lec tua l ­
ity is j u s t the oppos i te of intel l igence. T h e intel lectual pe r son is c o n ­
stantly ca r ry ing prejudices, i n fo rma t ion , a p r i o r i beliefs, k n o w l e d g e . He 
c a n n o t listen; before y o u have said any th ing , he has already conc luded . 
W h a t s o e v e r you say has to pass t h r o u g h so m a n y t hough t s in his m i n d 
that by the t ime i t reaches h i m i t is s o m e t h i n g totally different. Grea t d i s ­
t o r t i o n happens in h i m , and he is v e r y closed, a lmost b l ind and deaf. All 
experts , knowledgeab le peop le , are bl ind. 
Do y o u k n o w the old s to ry o f the five b l ind p e o p l e g o i n g to see an 
elephant? 
A teacher was tel l ing h e r s tudents , small girls and boys, this anc ien t 
fable. She to ld the w h o l e story, t h e n she asked a small boy, " C a n y o u tell 
m e w h o the peop le w e r e w h o w e n t t o see the e lephant and t h e n s tar ted 
quar re l ing?" She w a n t e d to k n o w w h e t h e r the b o y had l is tened w h i l e she 
was t each ing the story. 
A n d the boy s tood up and said, "Yes, I know. T h e y w e r e the exper t s . " 
She was t h i n k i n g he w o u l d answer, " T h e y w e r e five b l ind peop le . " 
B u t the small boy said, " T h o s e w e r e the exper ts ." He i s far m o r e r ight ; 
yes, they were exper ts . All exper ts are bl ind. Exper t i se means y o u b e c o m e 
b l ind to eve ry th ing else. You k n o w m o r e and m o r e abo u t less and less, 
and t h e n o n e day y o u arr ive a t t he u l t imate goal of k n o w i n g all ab o u t 
n o t h i n g . T h e n y o u are comple t e ly closed and n o t even a w i n d o w is 
open ; t h e n you have b e c o m e windowless . 
This is unintel l igence. Intell igence is to be o p e n to w ind , rain, and sun, 
to be o p e n to all. N o t to car ry the past is intelligence, to die to the past 
every m o m e n t is intell igence, to r emain fresh and innocen t is intell igence.

To b e c o m e f rozen is to b e c o m e idiot ic , to r e m a i n l iquid is to r e m a i n

T he mystics have c o m p a r e d m a n to a ladder. T h e ladder can be used 
for t w o th ings : You can use i t to go upward , a n d you can use i t to 
go d o w n w a r d . You use t he same l adder for b o t h purposes , on ly 
y o u r d i rec t ion changes . T h e ladder i s the same, bu t the result wi l l be t o ­
tally different. 
M a n is a l adder b e t w e e n heaven and hell . Tha t ' s w h y i t i s on ly h u ­
m a n beings w h o repress, w h o manipula te , w h o kill, w h o t ry t o c o n q u e r 
the natural flow of na ture . O n l y h u m a n beings are s t u p i d — a n d that i s 
because they can be buddhas . Because h u m a n beings have intel l igence, 
that 's w h y they can be stupid. S tupidi ty does n o t m e a n the absence o f i n ­
tel l igence, i t s imply means y o u have n o t used it. I f the re is no presence of 
in te l l igence y o u c a n n o t call h u m a n beings stupid. You c a n n o t call a rock 
s tup id—a rock is a rock, there is no ques t ion of stupidity. B u t y o u can call 
h u m a n s s tupid because w i t h h u m a n s there is h o p e , a ray of great l ight. 
W i t h the h u m a n be ing , a d o o r opens toward the beyond . M a n can t r an ­
scend himsel f a n d he i s n o t d o i n g i t—tha t ' s his stupidity. He can grow, 
and he is n o t g rowing , he is c l ing ing to all k inds of i m m a t u r i t y — t h a t is 
his stupidity. He goes on and on l iving in the past, w h i c h i s no m o r e — 
that i s his stupidity. Or he starts p ro jec t ing in to the future , w h i c h is n o t 
y e t — t h a t is his stupidity. 
O n e shou ld live in the present w i t h deep passion, w i t h great love,

22 
W h a t M a k e s P e o p l e S t u p i d 
is the same ene rgy—ups ide d o w n it is s tupidity; rear range it, pu t i t r ight , 
and i t b e c o m e s intel l igence. 
Intel l igence and stupidi ty are n o t separate energies . T h e ene rgy that

cont radic t ions i s stupidity. M a n can be s t u p i d — b u t d o n ' t t h i n k this i s

B u t t he soc ie ty—the so-cal led rel igions, the state, the c r o w d — w a n t s 
you to be stupid. N o b o d y wants y o u to be intel l igent . T h e y all c o n d i t i o n 
y o u to r ema in s tupid y o u r w h o l e life for the s imple reason that s tupid 
peop le are obed ien t . In te l l igent peop le start t h i n k i n g on their o w n ; they

lifestyle, their o w n way of seeing, o f be ing , o f g rowing . T h e y are no

You canno t force a b u d d h a to fol low stupid peop le , and the s tupid

SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST 
T h e h u m a n be ing is in a d i l e m m a for the s imple reason that he is n o t 
on ly intel l igent , he is also aware of his intel l igence. T h a t is s o m e t h i n g 
u n i q u e about m a n — h i s pr ivi lege, his prerogative, his g l o r y — b u t i t can 
t u r n ve ry easily i n to his agony. M a n is conscious that he is in te l l igent . 
T h a t consciousness b r ings its o w n p rob lems . T h e first p r o b l e m is that i t 
creates ego. 
E g o does n o t exist a n y w h e r e else excep t in h u m a n beings , and ego 
23 
starts g r o w i n g as t he child grows. T h e parents , the schools, colleges, u n i 
versity, t hey all he lp to s t rengthen the ego for the s imple reason that for 
centur ies m a n h a d to struggle to survive, and the idea has b e c o m e a fixa 
t ion , a deep unconsc ious cond i t i on ing , that 
on ly s t rong egos can survive in the s t rug 
gle of life. Life has b e c o m e jus t a struggle 
to survive. A n d scientists have m a d e i t even 
m o r e conv inc ing w i t h t he t h e o r y o f the 
"survival of the fittest." So we he lp every 
chi ld t o b e c o m e m o r e and m o r e s t rong i n 
the ego, and i t is there that the p r o b l e m 
arises. 
As the ego b e c o m e s s t rong i t starts sur­
r o u n d i n g intel l igence like a th ick layer of 
darkness. Intel l igence is l ight, ego is da rk ­
ness. Intel l igence is ve ry delicate, ego is 
very hard. Intel l igence is like a rose flower, 
ego is like a rock. A n d if you w a n t to sur­
vive, they say—the so-cal led au tho r i t i e s— 
then you have to b e c o m e rocklike, y o u 
have to be strong, invulnerable. You have to 
b e c o m e a citadel, a closed citadel, so y o u 
canno t be at tacked f rom outside. You have 
to b e c o m e impenet rable . 
B u t t h e n y o u b e c o m e closed. T h e n y o u start dy ing as far as y o u r i n ­
tel l igence is c o n c e r n e d because inte l l igence needs the o p e n sky, the w i n d , 
the air, the sun in o rde r to grow, to expand , to f low. To r e m a i n alive i t 
needs a cons tan t flow; if it b e c o m e s stagnant it b ecomes , slowly, a dead 
p h e n o m e n o n . 
We d o n ' t a l low chi ldren to r e m a i n inte l l igent . T h e first t h i n g i s that 
i f they are in te l l igent they wi l l be vulnerable , they wi l l be delicate, they 
wil l be o p e n . I f they are intel l igent they wil l be able to see m a n y falsities 
in the soc ie ty—in the state, in the chu rch , in t he educa t iona l system. 
24 
W h a t M a k e s P e o p l e S t u p i d 
T h e y wil l b e c o m e rebell ious. T h e y wil l be individuals; they wil l n o t be 
cowed easily. You can crush t h e m , b u t you c a n n o t enslave t h e m . You can 
destroy t h e m , b u t you c a n n o t force t h e m to compromise . 
In o n e sense inte l l igence is v e r y soft, like a rose flower, in a n o t h e r 
sense i t has its o w n s t rength . B u t that s t rength is subtle, n o t gross. T h a t 
s trength is the s t rength of rebel l ion, of a n o n c o m p r o m i s i n g at t i tude. O n e 
is ready to die, o n e is ready to suffer, b u t o n e is n o t ready to sell one ' s 
soul. 
A n d the w h o l e society needs slaves; i t needs p e o p l e w h o func t ion 
like robots , machines . I t does n o t w a n t people , i t wants mechan i sms . 
He nce the w h o l e c o n d i t i o n i n g is to m a k e the ego s t rong. I t serves a d o u ­
ble purpose . First, i t gives the p e r s o n the feeling that n o w he can s t ruggle 
in life. A n d secondly i t serves the purposes of all the vested interests. 
T h e y can exploi t the person; they can use h i m as a means to the i r o w n 
ends. 
H e n c e the w h o l e educa t iona l system rotates a r o u n d the idea o f a m ­
bi t ion; i t creates ambit iousness . Ambi t iousness is n o t h i n g b u t ego. " B e ­
c o m e the first, b e c o m e the mos t famous . B e c o m e a p r i m e min i s t e r or a 
president. B e c o m e w o r l d k n o w n , leave y o u r m a r k on history." I t does 
no t teach you to live totally. I t does n o t t each y o u to love totally. I t does 
no t teach you to live gracefully, i t teaches you h o w to exploi t o thers for 
your o w n purposes . A n d we th ink that the peop le w h o are clever are the 
ones w h o succeed. T h e y are c u n n i n g , b u t we call t h e m clever. T h e y are 
no t intel l igent people . 
An inte l l igent p e r s o n can never use a n o t h e r pe r son as a means ; he 
will respect the other . An inte l l igent p e r s o n wil l be able to see the eq u a l ­
ity of all. Yes, he wi l l see t he differences too , b u t differences m a k e no dif­
ference as far as equal i ty is c o n c e r n e d . He wil l have t r e m e n d o u s respect 
for o the r s ' f r e e d o m — h e c a n n o t explo i t t h e m , he c a n n o t r educe t h e m to 
things, he c a n n o t m a k e t h e m s tepping-s tones to the fulfil lment o f some 
absurd desire t o be the f i r s t . H e n c e we go on c o n d i t i o n i n g chi ldren. 
B u t before that c o n d i t i o n i n g happens , ch i ldren are immense ly i n t e l ­
ligent. I t has b e e n said by B u d d h a , by Lao T z u , by Jesus, by all the awak-
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
e n e d ones . Jesus says: Unless y o u are like a small chi ld there is no h o p e 
for you . Aga in he says: Unless y o u b e c o m e like small ch i ld ren y o u c a n ­
n o t e n t e r i n to m y k i n g d o m o f G o d . Aga in and again h e repeats o n e o f 
his m o s t famous bea t i tudes : Blessed are those w h o are t he last in this 
wor ld , because they wi l l be the first i n my k i n g d o m of G o d . He i s t e a c h ­
i n g n o n a m b i t i o u s n e s s — t o be the last. He says: Blessed are t he m e e k , for 
theirs i s the k i n g d o m o f G o d — t h e m e e k , t he h u m b l e , the peop le w h o 
are s tanding last in the q u e u e . I t was natural , v e r y natural , that the society 
he was b o r n in was against h i m , because he was des t roying the v e r y roots 
of the i r ambit iousness . 
A n d Jews have b e e n ve ry ambi t ious peop le , so m u c h so that for c e n ­
tur ies , against all hazards, t hey have car r ied t he idea in their minds that 
they are t he chosen peop le of G o d . A t h o u s a n d and o n e calamities have 
h a p p e n e d because of this s tupid idea; i f they can d r o p i t they wil l be 
m o r e accep ted in the wor ld . B u t they c a n n o t d r o p i t—the i r w h o l e ego i s 
involved in it. A n d i t is an ancient ego, at least th ree t housand years old. 
Since Moses they have b e e n ca r ry ing the idea that they are the chosen 
peop le o f G o d . A n d here comes this m a n w h o says, " B e the last!" We are 
m e a n t to be the first, and he says, " B e h u m b l e and m e e k ! " A n d we are the 
chosen peop le ! I f w e are h u m b l e and m e e k t h e n those w h o are n o t c h o ­
sen wil l b e c o m e the first! A n d Jews are ear thly peop le ; they d o n ' t b o t h e r 
m u c h abou t the o t h e r wor ld . T h e y are wor ldly: " W h o k n o w s ab o u t the 
o t h e r wor ld? He is saying, ' I f you are the last he r e y o u wil l be the first in 
my k i n g d o m of G o d . ' B u t w h e r e i s y o u r k i n g d o m of God? I t m a y be jus t 
a f ict ion, jus t a d ream." 
Jesus looks like a dreamer , a p o e t maybe . B u t he is dest roying their 
ve ry founda t ion . T h e y c a n n o t forgive h im; they have n o t even forgiven 
h i m yet. T h e y still ca r ry the idea that " w e are t he chosen peop le . " T h e y 
have suffered m u c h for it; the m o r e they have suffered the s t ronger the 
idea has b e c o m e — b e c a u s e i f y o u have to face suffering, y o u have to b e ­
c o m e m o r e and m o r e egoistic, m o r e rocklike, so that you can fight, s t rug­
gle, so that n o b o d y can destroy you . B u t they have also b e c o m e very 
closed.

W h a t M a k e s P e o p l e S t u p i d 
Jesus was crea t ing an o p e n i n g for t h e m ; they refused h i m . He was 
tel l ing t h e m to c o m e in to the o p e n sky. He was tel l ing t h e m to be j u s t

H i n d u s did n o t listen to B u d d h a for the same r e a s o n — H i n d u s are 
also ca r ry ing the idea they are the hol iest peop le in the w o r l d and the i r

such people , w h o are te l l ing the t ru th , because they seem to sabotage the 
v e r y s t ructure of th ings .

T h e m o t h e r was p repa r ing little Pedro to go to a party.

" C o m e on , M o t h e r ! " said Pedro . "Please dec ide before I

You see the po in t ? T h e child's response is really of t r emendous value. 
He says, "Please dec ide before I leave w h i c h i t is g o i n g to be. If y o u a l ­

STRIVING FOR E F F I C I E N C Y 
You will be surpr ised to k n o w that y o u r schools, colleges, and universit ies 
d o n ' t exist, in fact, to he lp y o u to b e c o m e in t e l l i gen t—no , n o t at all. I

N e v e r t h ink that in te l l igence and efficiency are s y n o n y m o u s . In te l l i ­

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
M e m o r y is a b i o c o m p u t e r . Inte l l igence is a totally different p h e ­
n o m e n o n . Inte l l igence arises o u t of med i t a t ion , in te l l igence arises ou t of 
rebel l ion. Inte l l igence does n o t arise o u t o f m e m o r y . B u t y o u r e x a m i n a ­

that s tupid p e o p l e have beautiful m e m o r i e s , and inte l l igent p e o p l e are 
n o t so good as far as m e m o r y is c o n c e r n e d . 
T h o m a s E d i s o n was n o t good as far as m e m o r y is c o n c e r n e d . He i n ­

single pe rson , Ed i son . B u t his m e m o r y was lousy, ve ry sloppy, so m u c h so

In t he First W o r l d War, r a t ion ing came for the first t ime in to exis­

Slowly he came closer to the w indow. T h e n the last pe r son in front of

E d i s o n said, "You are r ight! I had comple t e ly forgot ten! M a n y

Hi s wife used to have to keep eve ry th ing in o rde r because his w h o l e

w h a t the universities go on doing . All y o u r

REPRESSION A N D M A N I P U L A T I O N 
Each child is distracted, is d iver ted . H e n c e there is so m u c h stupidity. It is 
really a miracle h o w a few peop le have escaped f rom this p r i s o n — a B u d ­
dha , a Zarathustra , a Lao T z u , a Jesus, a Pythagoras . . . very few people . It 
is almost impossible to escape f rom this p r i son because the p r i son is all 
a round , and i t starts f rom the v e r y b e g i n n i n g . F r o m y o u r v e r y c h i l d h o o d 
y o u are cond i t i oned to be a p r i s o n e r — a Chr is t ian , a H i n d u , a M o ­
h a m m e d a n . A n d w h e n y o u are pr i soners o f churches , na t ions , races, t h e n 
natural ly there is g o i n g to be v io lence . 
No animal i s as v io len t as m a n . Animals kill b u t they kill on ly w h e n 
they are hungry , o therwise no t . M a n i s the. on ly an imal w h o enjoys 
kil l ing for no reason at all, as if k i l l ing in itself is a blissful activity. 
O n e day in a res taurant a l ion and a hare en te red . T h e m a n a g e r 
was shocked; he cou ld n o t bel ieve his eyes. A great silence fell 
over the restaurant . M a n y p e o p l e w e r e there eat ing, ta lking, g o s ­

to s t ammer to the hare , " W h a t w o u l d you like, sir?" 
T h e hare asked for coffee. T h e m a n a g e r asked, " A n d w h a t

T h e hare l aughed and he said, " D o y o u t h i n k i f he w e r e

Nagasak i—des t roy ing a h u n d r e d t h o u s a n d peop le w i t h i n three minu tes , 
j u s t for t he sheer j o y of des t ruc t ion . 
Th i s i s h a p p e n i n g because we have n o t al lowed man ' s intel l igence to 
f lower. A n d w h e n e v e r i t has h a p p e n e d in any society that intel l igence is al­
lowed a l i t t le f reedom, that society has b e c o m e weaker than o the r soci­
eties. It h a p p e n e d in India: India r ema ined a slave for t w o thousand years 
for m a n y reasons. O n e of the reasons was the great revolu t ion that was 
b r o u g h t by Kr ishna , Patanjali, Saraha, Mahavira , B u d d h a . These peop le 
b r o u g h t such a great revolut ion, such a radical change in the consciousness 
of India, that m a n y peop le w e r e released f rom the b o n d a g e of stupidity; a 
great intel l igence was released. T h e result was that the intel l igent peop le 
s topped kil l ing, they b e c a m e nonvio len t ; they refused to be recru i ted i n to 
the army. Buddhis ts and Jains refused to be recru i ted in to the army, the 
B r a h m i n s refused to be recru i ted i n to the army. N o w this was the cream, 
and the c ream refused to fight. T h e n v e r y stupid count r ies and ve ry o rd i ­
n a r y p e o p l e — H u n s , Turks, M o g h u l s , w h o were backward i n every possi­
ble w a y — o v e r r a n the country . A n d because the m o s t intel l igent peop le of 
the y o u n g e r genera t ion were no l onge r in teres ted in kill ing and violence, 
there was no resistance, no fight. These peop le c o n q u e r e d the c o u n t r y — a 
b ig c o u n t r y was c o n q u e r e d by ve ry small count r ies . For t w o thousand 
years India r e m a i n e d in slavery for that s imple reason. 
T h e same th ing happened in Athens . Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, P y t h a g o ­
ras, Heraclitus . . . these were the people w h o released great intelligence, and 
a climate was created of f reedom, of free th inking. It was one of the mos t 
beautiful p h e n o m e n a that was happen ing on the earth, and i t was destroyed 
by stupid people , barbarians. T h e w h o l e Greek civilization disappeared. 
My o w n suggest ion i s that unless we create a w o r l d g o v e r n m e n t , i n ­
tel l igence c a n n o t be al lowed. T h e t ime has c o m e for a w o r l d g o v e r n ­
m e n t . N a t i o n a l g o v e r n m e n t s are no l onge r needed : T h e y are th ings o f 
the past, they are par t of ou r s tupid past. N a t i o n s are no longer needed , 
on ly a w o r l d g o v e r n m e n t . A n d if there is a w o r l d g o v e r n m e n t i t wi l l have 
a total ly different quality. 
W h a t M a k e s P e o p l e S t u p i d 
35 
A r m i e s wil l have to be r educed , because there wi l l be no ques t ion o f 
f ighting w i t h anybody. N o w seventy pe rcen t o f the wor ld ' s money , 
weal th , resources goes to the mi l i t a ry and mi l i ta ry w e a p o n s — s e v e n t y 
percent! O n l y th i r ty pe rcen t is left for o the r purposes . T h a t means sev­
en ty percent o f o u r ene rgy i s d e v o t e d to kil l ing, to be ing v io lent , to b e ­
ing destructive. 
A w o r l d g o v e r n m e n t is an absolute necessity to save humani ty . A n d 
the quali ty of the w o r l d g o v e r n m e n t wi l l be totally different because i t 
w o n ' t need great armies; j u s t small pol ice forces wi l l . be e n o u g h . I t wi l l 
take care of all things l ike the pos t office, the railway, the airplanes, et 
ce t e ra—but they are n o t destruct ive; they serve peop le . A n d o n c e t he 
armies disappear f rom the wor ld , great intel l igence wil l be re leased— 
because the a r m y is destruct ive of inte l l igence. I t recruits the heal thiest 
peop le and destroys their m i n d s , because a real soldier is possible on ly if 
the pe r son becomes absolutely mechan ica l . 
M a n kills for no reason. M a n tries to repress ra ther t h a n to u n d e r ­
stand, to manipu la te ra ther t h a n to relate, because to relate w i t h s o m e ­
b o d y needs great unde r s t and ing . 
Man ipu l a t i on needs no unde r s t and ing . R e p r e s s i o n is easy, v e r y 
easy—any fool can do it. Tha t ' s w h y i f y o u go to the monas te r i e s y o u 
wi l l find all k inds of repressions and y o u wi l l find all k inds of fools ga th ­
ered toge ther there . I have never c o m e across in te l l igent m o n k s and nuns ; 
i f they are intel l igent they wil l n o t be m o n k s and nuns a n y m o r e . T h e y 
wi l l r e n o u n c e that nonsense , they wi l l c o m e o u t o f their so-cal led re l i ­
gious pr isons . B u t repression needs no w i s d o m ; i t s imply needs a p o w e r ­
ful ego, so you can go on suppressing eve ry th ing in to the unconsc ious . 
B u t wha teve r y o u suppress wil l have to be suppressed again and a g a i n — 
and still i t wil l never be e l iminated . I t wi l l b e c o m e m o r e and m o r e p o w ­

that is creat ing all o u r neuroses, all o u r pervers ions . Suppress sex and you 
wil l b e c o m e m o r e sexual; y o u r w h o l e life wil l be co lo red w i t h sex. You 
wil l t h i n k always in t e r m s of sexuality and n o t h i n g else. Suppress sex and 
the ugly ins t i tu t ion of pros t i tu t ion wi l l arise, is bound to arise. T h e m o r e

THE SIN OF DISOBEDIENCE 
I t i s said that w h e n H e n r y T h o r e a u came o u t o f t he university, E m e r s o n 
gave a b ig par ty to celebrate the occasion. A n d he to ld the par t ic ipants , " I

in t he univers i ty b u t because he has b e e n able to c o m e back f rom the

What Makes People Stupid 
Intel l igence s imply means the ability to respond, because life is a flux. 
You have to be aware and to see w h a t is d e m a n d e d of you , w h a t is the 
chal lenge o f the s i tuat ion. T h e inte l l igent pe r son behaves acco rd ing to 
the si tuat ion, and the s tupid behaves accord ing to the r e a d y - m a d e a n ­
swers. W h e t h e r those answers c o m e f rom B u d d h a , Chr i s t , o r Kr i shna , he 
always carries " sc r ip tu res" a r o u n d himself. He is afraid to d e p e n d on 
himself. T h e intel l igent pe r son depends on his o w n insight. He trusts his 
o w n be ing . He loves and respects himself. T h e un in te l l igen t pe r son r e ­
spects others . 
A n d you can see the p o i n t — w h y are 
the vested interests interested in creat ing 
stupidity? Because that is the on ly way they 
can get respect. No parents really w a n t 
their chi ldren to be intel l igent , because i f 
the chi ldren are intel l igent they are rebel ­
lious, too; they are d isobedient , too. O b e d i ­
ence has been imposed on y o u as a great 
va lue—it is no t . It is one of the basic causes 
of the des t ruct ion of y o u r intel l igence. 
I am n o t saying be d i sobedien t . I am 
simply saying that w h e n y o u feel like b e i n g 
obed ien t , be obed ien t ; w h e n y o u feel like 
be ing d isobedient , be t r u e to yourself. 
Your on ly responsibil i ty is t oward yourse l f 
and n o b o d y else. 
An intel l igent p e r s o n takes risks. He 
will be ready to die ra ther t h a n to c o m p r o ­
mise. Of course, he wi l l n o t fight abou t 
unnecessary th ings , he wi l l n o t fight abou t 
nonessent ia ls—but as far as the essentials 
are c o n c e r n e d he i s n o t g o i n g to be obed ien t . 
B u t y o u have obeyed even abou t the essentials. W h a t i s y o u r bel ief in 
God? You have simply obeyed o thers . W h a t do you k n o w ab o u t God? 
37 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
38 
You have s imply obeyed; you have fol lowed y o u r parents , and they fol­
l o w e d the i r parents . Parents are happy w i t h un in te l l igen t ch i ldren b e ­
cause they are o b e d i e n t — t h e y have to be obed ien t . T h e chi ldren c o m e to 
k n o w o n e th ing , that wha teve r they do i s b o u n d to be w r o n g , so i t i s b e t ­
ter to listen to t he parents ' advice. 
For thousands o f years every society has b e e n tel l ing chi ldren, " R e ­
spect y o u r parents , " because they are afraid of c h i l d r e n — t h e y m a y n o t 
respect the i r parents . A n d I am n o t saying to disrespect y o u r parents . I am 
s imply saying that y o u mus t first respect yourself. O u t of that respect, you 
can respect y o u r parents , y o u r t e ache r s—you can respect everybody. B u t 
i f y o u d o n ' t respect yourself, y o u r respect for a n y b o d y else is g o i n g to be 
false; deep d o w n there wi l l be hat red . E a c h chi ld hates his parents . . . 
deep d o w n he feels, " T h e parents are my enemies . " He can see h o w his 
in te l l igence is b e i n g cr ippled . 
After p u t t i n g he r t w o chi ldren to b e d o n e n ight , a y o u n g m o t h e r 
changed i n t o a ragged blouse and an o ld pai r of slacks and p r o ­
ceeded to wash her hair. All d u r i n g the s h a m p o o she cou ld hear 
the ch i ldren g r o w i n g wi lde r and noisier. F in ish ing as h u r r i e d l y 
as possible, she w r a p p e d a large towel a r o u n d he r head, s t o r m e d 
in to the i r r o o m , and pu t t h e m back to b e d w i t h a s te rn w a r n i n g 
to stay there . As she left, she hea rd the t w o - y e a r - o l d say to his 
sister in a t r emb l ing voice, " W h o was that?" 
T h i s is intel l igence! 
B u t t he society is n o t in teres ted in in te l l igent people . I t i s n o t i n t e r ­
ested in seekers, i t is in teres ted in soldiers. I t wan t s to create soldiers. A n d 
unless y o u are s tupid you c a n n o t be a good soldier. T h e greater you are in 
y o u r s tupidi ty the bet ter , as far as b e i n g a soldier is conce rned . 
As the last soldier was abou t to j u m p f rom the a i rplane he 
pan icked , g r abbed h o l d of his sergeant and said, " W h a t happens 
i f my second pa rachu te doesn ' t open , e i the r?" 
What Makes People Stupid 
" D o n ' t wor ry , " said t he sergeant w i t h a smile. "Just c o m e

Life is a beautiful j o u r n e y if it is a process of cons tan t l ea rn ing , e x ­
p lora t ion . T h e n i t i s exc i t emen t every m o m e n t , because every m o m e n t 
you are o p e n i n g a n e w door , every m o m e n t y o u are c o m i n g in con tac t 
w i t h a n e w mystery. 
T h e w o r d disciple means o n e w h o learns, and discipline means t he p r o ­
cess of learning. B u t the w o r d has b e e n prost i tu ted. N o w discipline means 
obedience . T h e y have t u r n e d the w h o l e w o r l d i n to a B o y Scout camp. 
H i g h above there i s s o m e b o d y w h o k n o w s — y o u n e e d n o t learn , y o u 
have simply to obey. T h e y have t u r n e d the m e a n i n g of discipline i n to its

Lea rn ing automat ica l ly consists o f d o u b t i n g , o f ques t ion ing , o f b e ­
ing skeptical, of be ing c u r i o u s — n o t of be ing a bel iever certainly, because 
a believer never learns. B u t they have used the w o r d for thousands of 
years in this way. A n d i t i s n o t on ly o n e w o r d that they have pros t i tu ted , 
they have pros t i tu ted m a n y words . Beautiful words have b e c o m e so ugly 
in the hands of the ves ted interests that you c a n n o t even i m a g i n e the 
or ig inal m e a n i n g of the w o r d . . . thousands of years of misuse. 
T h e y w a n t eve rybody to be discipl ined the way p e o p l e are disci ­
p l ined in the army. You are o rde r ed and y o u have to do i t w i t h o u t asking 
why. Th i s i s n o t the way of learn ing! A n d f rom the v e r y b e g i n n i n g they 
have imposed stories on t he minds of p e o p l e — f o r example that t he first 
sin c o m m i t t e d was d isobedience . A d a m and Eve were expel led f rom the 
G a r d e n o f E d e n because they disobeyed. 
I have looked at i t in thousands of ways, b u t I d o n ' t see that A d a m 
and Eve c o m m i t t e d any sin o r any c r ime . T h e y w e r e s imply exp lo r ing . 
You are in a garden and y o u start e x p l o r i n g the fruits and flowers and 
w h a t is edible and w h a t is n o t edible . 
A n d G o d i s responsible, because he p roh ib i t ed t h e m f rom t w o trees. 
He indicated the trees: "You shou ld n o t approach these t w o trees. O n e i s 
the tree of w i s d o m , and the o t h e r is the t ree of e te rna l life." Just t h ink , i f 
39 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
y o u w e r e A d a m and E v e — w a s n o t G o d himself t e m p t i n g you t o g o t o 
these t w o trees? A n d those t w o trees w e r e o f w i s d o m and o f e ternal 
l i f e — w h y shou ld G o d be against t h e m ? If he w e r e really a father, o n e 
w h o loved you , he m i g h t have p o i n t e d to t h e m , saying, " T h i s i s a p o i ­
sonous tree, d o n ' t eat f rom it." O r , " T h i s is t he tree of death; i f y o u eat 
any th ing f rom i t y o u wil l d ie ." B u t these t w o trees are perfectly good! Eat 
as m u c h as y o u can, because to be wise and to have e te rna l life is a b ­
solutely r igh t . 
E v e r y father w o u l d w a n t his ch i ldren to have w i s d o m and e ternal 
life. T h i s father seems to be absolutely loveless. N o t on ly loveless but , as 
the devil said to Eve, " H e has p reven ted y o u f rom these t w o trees. Do 
y o u k n o w the reason? T h e reason i s that i f y o u eat f rom these t w o trees 
y o u wi l l be equa l t o h i m , and he i s jea lous . He does n o t w a n t y o u to b e ­
c o m e divine . He does n o t w a n t y o u t o b e c o m e gods, full o f w i s d o m and 
e ternal life." 
I c a n n o t see that the devil 's a r g u m e n t has any flaw in it. It is a b ­
solutely r igh t . In fact, he is the first benefac tor of humani ty . W i t h o u t 
h i m , perhaps there w o u l d have b e e n n o h u m a n i t y — n o G a u t a m B u d d h a ,

b e e n v e r y happy, that his ch i ldren are v e r y obed ien t ! 
B u t this obed ience i s po i son , p u r e po i son . T h e devil mus t be 
c o u n t e d as t he first r evo lu t ionary of t he wor ld , and the first m a n to t h ink

All over t he wor ld , in every army, they are t u r n i n g mil l ions of people

backward . " For w h a t is all this circus g o ­
ing on? A n d for years i t goes o n . 
Th i s is to des t roy y o u r in te l l igence . 
For years c o n t i n u o u s l y you go on fo l low­
ing any k ind of s tupid o rder , mean ing less , 
every day in the m o r n i n g , every day in 
the e v e n i n g — a n d y o u are n o t supposed 
to ask why. You j u s t have to do it, to do i t 
as perfectly as possible; the re is no n e e d 
for you to u n d e r s t a n d why. A n d w h e n a 
person goes t h r o u g h such a t r a i n i n g for 
years, the natural effect is tha t he stops 
asking why. 
T h e ques t ion ing a t t i tude is the very 
base of all intel l igence. T h e m o m e n t you 
stop asking why, you have s topped g r o w i n g 
as far as intel l igence is c o n c e r n e d . 
It happened in the Second Wor ld War . . . 
A ret i red a r m y m a n . . . he h a d fought i n the First W o r l d 
War and he was h o n o r e d ; he was a brave m a n . A n d n o w almost 
twenty-f ive years h a d passed. He had a small f a rm and l ived 
silently. 
He was g o i n g f rom the f a rm to the t o w n w i t h a bucke t fu l 
of eggs, and a few peop le in a restaurant , jus t jokingly , played a 
t r ick o n the p o o r o ld a r m y m a n . O n e o f the m e n i n the res tau­
rant shouted , " A t t e n t i o n ! " and the m a n d r o p p e d the b u c k e t a n d 
stood in the pos i t ion of a t t en t ion . 
I t h a d b e e n twenty-f ive years since he had g o n e t h r o u g h the 
t raining. B u t the t ra in ing h a d g o n e in to the bones , i n t o the 
blood, i n to the m a r r o w ; i t h a d b e c o m e par t o f t he unconsc ious . 
He comple te ly forgot w h a t he was d o i n g — i t h a p p e n e d a lmost 
autonomously , mechanical ly. 
41 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
42 
He was very angry. But those peop le said, "Your anger is 
n o t r igh t , because we can call o u t any w o r d we wan t . W h o i s 
te l l ing you to fol low i t?" 
He said, " I t i s too late for me to dec ide w h e t h e r to fol low i t 
o r n o t to fol low it. My w h o l e m i n d funct ions like a m a c h i n e . 
T h o s e twenty-f ive years s imply disappeared. Attention on ly 
means a t t en t ion . You destroyed my eggs, and I am a p o o r 
m a n . . ." 
B u t this i s b e i n g d o n e all over the wor ld . A n d n o t on ly today; from 
the v e r y b e g i n n i n g armies have b e e n t ra ined n o t to use the i r intel l igence 
b u t to fol low orders . 
You have to unde r s t and o n e t h i n g v e r y clearly: To fol low an order 
and to unde r s t and a t h i n g are t w o diametr ical ly oppos i te th ings . If, by 
unde r s t and ing , y o u r intel l igence feels satisfied and y o u do s o m e t h i n g out 
of that , y o u are n o t fo l lowing an o rde r f rom the outs ide; y o u are fol low­
i n g y o u r o w n intel l igence. 
I am r e m i n d e d of a n o t h e r inc iden t in the First W o r l d War. In Berlin, 
a G e r m a n professor of logic was r ec ru i t ed i n to the army. T h e r e was a 
shor tage of soldiers, and eve rybody w h o was physically able was asked to 
volunteer . O the rwi se , they w e r e forc ing p e o p l e to j o i n the army. All the 
societies, all t he nat ions , all the cul tures , have taken, i t for g ran ted tha t the 
individual exists for t h e m , n o t vice versa. 
To m e , ju s t the oppos i te is the case: T h e society exists for the ind i ­
vidual , the cu l ture exists for the individual , the na t ion exists for t he indi ­
vidual . E v e r y t h i n g else can be sacrificed, b u t t he individual c a n n o t be 
sacrificed for any th ing . Individual i ty is the v e r y f lower ing of exis tence 
n o t h i n g is higher . B u t no cul ture , no society, no civilization is ready to 
accept that s imple t ru th . 
T h e professor was forced to vo lun t ee r for t he army. He said, " I am 
n o t a m a n w h o can fight. I can argue, I am a logician. If y o u need some­
b o d y to argue w i t h t he enemies I am ready, b u t f ight ing i s n o t my busi 
ness. It is barbarous to fight." 
What Makes People Stupid 
B u t n o b o d y l istened, and finally he was b r o u g h t to the parade 
grounds . T h e parade started, and the c o m m a n d e r said, "Left t u r n . " 
E v e r y b o d y t u r n e d left, b u t the professor r e m a i n e d s tanding as he was 
standing. 
T h e c o m m a n d e r was a little w o r r i e d : " W h a t i s the mat te r? Perhaps 
the m a n i s deaf." So he s h o u t e d loudly, " N o w t u r n to the left again!" All 
the peop le t u r n e d to t he left again, b u t that m a n r e m a i n e d s tanding as i f 
he had n o t heard any th ing . Forward , backward . . . all the orders w e r e 
given and eve rybody fol lowed. T h a t m a n r e m a i n e d jus t s tanding in his 
place. 
He was a w e l l - k n o w n professor; even the c o m m a n d e r k n e w h i m . He 
could n o t be treated jus t like any o t h e r soldier, he inspired a cer ta in r e ­
spect. Finally, w h e n the parade e n d e d and eve rybody r e t u r n e d to w h e r e 
they had started, the c o m m a n d e r w e n t to the professor and asked, "Is 
there some p r o b l e m w i t h y o u r ears? C a n ' t you hea r?" 
He said, " I can hear." 
" B u t t hen , " the c o m m a n d e r said, " w h y did you r ema in standing? 
W h y did you n o t fol low the o rders?" 
He said, " W h a t i s t he po in t? W h e n eve rybody finally has to c o m e 
back to the same state, after all this m o v e m e n t go ing forward and b a c k ­
ward, left and r ight , w h a t have they ga ined?" 
T h e c o m m a n d e r said, " I t is n o t a ques t ion of ga in ing, i t is a ques t ion 
of t ra ining!" 
B u t he said, " I d o n ' t n e e d any t ra in ing . You c o m e to the same place 
after do ing all kinds of s tupid th ings , w h i c h I d o n ' t see any p o i n t in . C a n 
you explain to me w h y I shou ld t u r n left and n o t r i gh t ? " 
T h e c o m m a n d e r said, "S t range , no soldier asks such ques t ions ." 
T h e professor said, "I am n o t a soldier, I am a professor. I have b e e n 
forced to be here, b u t y o u c a n n o t force me to do things against my in t e l ­
l igence." 
T h e c o m m a n d e r w e n t t o the h ighe r authori t ies and said, " W h a t t o do 
w i t h this man? He may r u i n the o thers—because eve rybody is l augh ing a t 
Me and everybody is saying, 'Professor ,you did great!' I c a n n o t tackle that 
43 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
m a n . He asks such quest ions, and each t h i n g has to be explained: 'Unless 
I unders tand it, unless my intelligence supports it, I am no t go ing to do i t . ' " 
T h e c o m m a n d e r in chief said, " I k n o w the m a n . He i s a great log i ­
cian. H i s w h o l e life's t ra in ing is in ques t ion ing eve ry th ing . I wi l l take 
care o f h i m , d o n ' t be w o r r i e d . " 
He called the professor to his office and said, " I am sorry, b u t we 
c a n n o t do any th ing . You have b e e n recru i ted ; the c o u n t r y needs soldiers. 
B u t I wil l give y o u some w o r k that wi l l n o t create any difficulty for you 
and wi l l n o t create any difficulty for o thers . You c o m e w i t h me to the

He t o o k the professor there , and s h o w e d h i m a b i g pile of g reen peas. 
He to ld t he professor, "Si t d o w n here . You can sort o u t the b ig peas on 
o n e side and the small peas on the o t h e r side. In an h o u r I wi l l c o m e to 
see h o w things are progressing." 
After an h o u r he came back. T h e professor was si t t ing there and the 
peas w e r e also si t t ing there , in the same place. He said, " W h a t is the ma t ­
ter? You have n o t even started." 
T h e professor said, " F o r the first and for the last t ime, I w a n t you all to 
under s t and that unless you explain to me . . . W h y should I sort ou t the 
peas? My intel l igence feels insulted by you . Am I an idiot , to sort these 
peas? W h a t is t he need? Moreover , the re are o t h e r difficulties. Sitting 
here , I t h o u g h t that perhaps there cou ld be some need, bu t there are ques­
t ions w h i c h have to be decided: T h e r e are peas that are b ig and there are 
peas that are small, b u t there are peas of m a n y o the r sizes. W h e r e are they 
go ing to go? You have n o t given me any cri ter ia ." 
O r d e r s , disciplines, gu ide l ines—these have b e e n used by peop le w h o

B u t r e m e m b e r that the difference b e t w e e n K h o m e i n i and Eins te in i s 
n o t of quality, i t is on ly of quantity, because par t of K h o m e i n i is Alber t 
Eins te in , and the major par t of Alber t E ins te in is also K h o m e i n i . 
R e c e n t l y t he results of a t h ree -yea r - long s tudy of Albe r t Einstein 's 
b ra in w e r e publ ished. I t t o o k three years ju s t to c o u n t the cells of his 
b ra in . T h e r e are mil l ions of cells in every b ra in d o i n g different k inds of 
specific w o r k : It is a v e r y miraculous wor ld . 
H o w a cer ta in cell funct ions in a cer ta in w a y is still n o t k n o w n . A 
cer ta in cell th inks , a cer ta in cell dreams, a cer ta in cell poet izes , a cer ta in 
cell paints . W h a t makes the difference b e t w e e n these groups of cells? T h e y 
are all alike as far as chemis t ry and physiology is conce rned ; there seems 
to be no difference at all. B u t there are cells w h i c h th ink , there are cells 
w h i c h imag ine , t he re are cells w h i c h are ma themat i ca l , and the re are 
cells w h i c h are phi losophical . It is a w h o l e wor ld . 
T h r e e years c o u n t i n g the cells of Alber t Einste in 's b r a i n — t h e result 
is ve ry significant. A cer ta in k i n d of cell has b e e n found in his b r a i n — 
twen ty - seven percen t m o r e than in the average bra in . T h a t cer ta in k ind 
of cell has on ly o n e funct ion: to feed, n o u r i s h , the t h i n k i n g cells. I t has 
no direct func t ion , i t is a n o u r i s h m e n t to t he t h i n k i n g cells. A n d this 
n o u r i s h i n g cell has b e e n found to be twen ty - seven percen t m o r e n u m e r ­
ous in E ins te in t h a n in the ordinary, average m a n . 
N o w the difference is of quantity, it is n o t a qualitative difference: 
T h o s e extra twenty-seven percent of cells can be g r o w n in you . A n d w h y 
only twenty-seven? Two h u n d r e d and seventy percent m o r e can be grown, 
because it is wel l k n o w n and an established fact h o w those cells grow. 
In w h i t e m i c e they have b e e n g r o w i n g all k inds of cells. I f the w h i t e

s o m e w h e r e and he has to find the w a y t h r o u g h all k inds of labyr inths to 
reach the food, and he has to r e m e m b e r t he ways that he has followed—-
of course a cer ta in k i n d of t h i n k i n g has started. A n d the m o r e he thinks, 
the greater his n e e d for the n o u r i s h i n g cell.

Re l ig ions kill this v e r y n o u r i s h i n g cell

D o n ' t t ry to find ou t on y o u r o w n . Jesus

You remain average. A n d average means

Hence , I call man ' s m i n d a Pandora ' s

because wha teve r has h a p p e n e d in evo lu ­

of darkness. T h e fear of darkness comes f rom those days w h e n ways to 
create fire h a d n o t b e e n discovered. T h o s e w e r e t he days of darkness, and 
darkness b e c a m e almost s y n o n y m o u s w i t h evil. E v e r y w h e r e evil is 
pa in ted as dark, black. Darkness b e c a m e s y n o n y m o u s w i t h dea th . E v e r y ­
w h e r e dea th is pa in ted as black. 
T h e reason i s v e r y clear: Before m a n l ea rned h o w to create fire, n igh t 
was the m o s t dangerous t ime. I f you survived o n e n igh t y o u h a d d o n e 
s o m e t h i n g really great, because in the n igh t all t he wi ld animals were 
ready to attack you . You cou ld n o t sleep, y o u h a d to r e m a i n awake—-just 
the fear of the wi ld animals was e n o u g h to keep you awake. A n d still they 
w o u l d attack in darkness, and m a n was helpless. 
So darkness b e c a m e evil, bad, and s y n o n y m o u s w i t h dea th . A n d the 
fear has en t e r ed so deep in the hea r t tha t i t remains even today, w h e n 
darkness has g o n e t h r o u g h a c o m p l e t e t rans format ion . . . N e i t h e r do 
w i ld animals attack you in t he dark, n o r does darkness b r i n g any evil or 
dea th to you . I t on ly br ings soo th ing sleep, takes away all the t iredness of 
the day; makes you again y o u n g , alive, full of energy, ready to m e e t t o ­
m o r r o w ' s m o r n i n g sun. B u t o u r a t t i tude remains the same. So i s the case 
w i t h eve ry th ing . 
In the past, t h r o u g h o u t the w h o l e o f evolu t ion , m a n had to b e c o m e 
par t of a cer ta in g roup , organiza t ion , society, t r ibe , for the s imple reason 
that a lone, he was so helpless. A lone , and the w h o l e wi lderness against 
y o u — i t was difficult to face it. Together , w i t h a c rowd, y o u felt m o r e 
p ro tec ted , m o r e secure. 
You have to r e m e m b e r that m a n i s the m o s t w e a k and helpless ani­
m a l in t he wor ld , and because of this helplessness and weakness our 
w h o l e civil ization and cul ture has g r o w n . So d o n ' t t h i n k of i t as a curse; 
it has p roved a great, the greatest, blessing. Lions c a n n o t create a society, 
l ions c a n n o t create cul ture because a l ion has no n e e d of the g roup . He 
a lone i s power fu l e n o u g h . Sheep m o v e in g roups ; l ions d o n ' t m o v e in

Lions like to be a lone for the s imple reason that they are e n o u g h for

hands n o r can he eat raw mea t directly w i t h his t ee th . All his l imbs are 
weaker than those o f o t h e r animals . He c a n n o t r u n w i t h a horse o r w i t h 
a dog, or w i t h a bull , or w i t h a wolf, or w i t h a d e e r — h e is j u s t a n o b o d y ! 
I t i s good that these p e o p l e d o n ' t par t ic ipate in y o u r O l y m p i c races; o t h ­
erwise your great r unne r s w o u l d jus t l ook silly. You c a n n o t m o v e like 
monkeys f rom o n e tree t o another . T h e y go on j u m p i n g f rom o n e tree t o 
ano the r tree for miles; they n e e d n o t t o u c h the g r o u n d . You c a n n o t fight 
even w i t h a monkey . 
I t has to be accepted that m a n is the weakest animal on the ear th . 
A n d this i s the founda t ion of his w h o l e behavior , his c o m m i t m e n t s , his 
groupings . He has to be par t o f s o m e t h i n g b igger t h a n himself; on ly t h e n 
does he feel safe. 
He had to invent all k inds o f w e a p o n s . No an imal has b o t h e r e d to 
invent weapons . T h e r e is no need ; the i r hands , the i r tee th , the i r nails, are 
e n ough . F r o m the earliest days m a n h a d to invent weapons—fi r s t m a d e 
of stones, rocks, t h e n slowly w i t h metals . T h e n he had to admi t that even 
w i t h a w e a p o n in his h a n d he c o u l d n o t fight w i t h a l i on or an an ima l

That ' s h o w we have ar r ived a t nuc lear weapons . N o w we have t aken

You need n o t k n o w w h e r e t he rocket is; i t goes on its p r o g r a m m e d 
course. I t wil l reach the K r e m l i n or i t wi l l reach the W h i t e H o u s e ; that

in Texas and the bu t tons , the switches, m a y be s o m e w h e r e in the W h i t e

M a n has created distance b e t w e e n himsel f and the enemy, and finally

B u t eve ry th ing has g r o w n in a v e r y logical way. M a n has b e c o m e the

for they shall i nhe r i t the k i n g d o m of the

All the animals are provided w i t h clues. 
T h e y never face any p rob lem. W h e n e v e r

N o w m a n can be alone. N o w there i s no need for h i m to be fanatically 
commi t t ed to any religious group, any political ideology—Chris t iani ty , 
Hinduism, M o h a m m e d a n i s m , c o m m u n i s m , fascism—there i s no need. Bu t

the same things again and again. 
T h e y cluster in g r o u p s — a n d this has to be a c o m m i t m e n t , because

A n d w h y are they fanatically c o m m i t t e d ? T h e y have to be fanatically

F r o m w h e r e does this u rge to be fanatically c o m m i t t e d come? 
I t comes f rom y o u r doub t . You c a n n o t really conv ince yourself that

k n o w w h a t this life is all abou t . B u t somebody k n o w s , and you can follow 
that somebody. You are relieved of a great b u r d e n of uncer ta inty. All that 
is n e e d e d f rom y o u r side is a fanatical belief. 
T h e fanatical bel ief serves b o t h sides. T h e leader needs i t because he 
himself i s j u s t l ike you , t r embl ing deep inside; he k n o w s n o t h i n g . All he 
k n o w s is that he can shou t be t t e r t h a n you , that he i s m o r e ar t iculate than 
you , that he at least can pose as if he k n o w s — t h a t he is a g o o d actor, a

I have heard that i t h a p p e n e d that a journa l i s t d i ed and reached the 
gates of paradise. Journal is ts are n o t supposed to go there ; h o w i t h a p ­
p e n e d I d o n ' t know. T h e gatekeeper l o o k e d a t h i m a n d said, "Are you a 
j ou rna l i s t ? " 
He said, " O f course , and as a press r e p o r t e r I am al lowed every ­
w h e r e . Let m e in . " 
T h e ga tekeeper said, " T h e r e is a difficulty. In the first place, in para­
dise we d o n ' t have any newspape r because no news happens h e r e — n o 
c r ime , no d runkards , no rape. T h e r e are on ly saints, d r i ed up, f rozen from

journal i s t s , b u t that has b e e n full f rom the v e r y b e g i n n i n g . You wil l have 
to go to the o t h e r gate on the o t h e r side o f t he road." 
T h e journa l i s t said, " C a n y o u do a little favor for me? I wil l leave af­
ter t w e n t y - f o u r hou r s , b u t ju s t give me a chance , at least a tour . If you 
c a n n o t al low me a p e r m a n e n t , residential g reen card, y o u can let me have 
a t w e n t y - f o u r - h o u r tour . T h a t is n o t too m u c h to ask. Since I c o m e f rom 
so far away, have m e r c y on m e . A n d give me o n e p romise : I f I can c o n ­
vince o n e o f those t e n journal is ts to go to hel l in my place, t h e n wil l you 
let me stay h e r e ? " 
T h e ga tekeeper said, " N o p r o b l e m . I f y o u can convince s o m e b o d y 
to go to the o the r place, y o u can be in his place. I t makes no difference to 
us; the quo ta is t en . " 
M i n d - A P a n d o r a s B o x 
T h e m a n said, " T h e n jus t give m e t w e n t y - f o u r hou r s . " 
He w e n t i n and he s tar ted ta lking to everybody, w h o m e v e r he me t . 
"Have you heard that in hel l they are g o i n g to start a n e w daily n e w s p a ­
per the biggest that has ever b e e n t r ied? A n d they are in n e e d of a ch ief 
editor, edi tor ial staff, and all k inds of journal i s t s . Week ly edi tors , and l i t­

T h e others said, " W e have n o t heard anyth ing , b u t that i s great . In

in the b e g i n n i n g of t ime, b u t since t h e n n o t h i n g has h a p p e n e d . So we go 
on reading the first issue again and again, w h a t else to do? T h i s n e w p a ­

twenty- four hour s , the journa l i s t w e n t back to the gate. T h e ga tekeeper 
immediately closed the d o o r and said, " R e m a i n ins ide!" 
H e said, " W h y ? " 
T h e gatekeeper said, "You are a t r i cky fellow. All those t en have es ­
caped to the o the r place, n o w I c a n n o t al low you to go. At least o n e j o u r ­
nalist should be here ." 
T h e journa l i s t said, " B u t I c a n n o t r e m a i n here! You have to let me 
go!" 
T h e gatekeeper said, " A r e y o u m a d ? You spread that r u m o r , w h i c h i s 
absolutely false. T h e y go t the idea that they wil l get great j o b s in hell , and 
became e x c i t e d — b u t w h y are y o u w a n t i n g t o g o ? " 
He said, " W h o k n o w s , there m a y be s o m e t h i n g in it. I c a n n o t stay 
here and miss it. You c a n n o t stop me anyway because I am n o t supposed 
to be here; I am only a tour is t for t w e n t y - f o u r hou r s . R e m e m b e r , tha t 
was our basic dec i s ion—tha t for t w e n t y - f o u r h o u r s I wil l be in, and t h e n 
I will go out . You c a n n o t s top m e — y o u c a n n o t go against y o u r w o r d . " 
B u t the gatekeeper t r i ed hard: "You have spread the r u m o r ; i t i s a b ­
solutely false. A n d d o n ' t b r i n g t rouble on me because the hierarchy, the 
bureaucracy, wi l l ask me , W h e r e are all the t en journal is ts? ' O n c e in a 
whi le they take t he census a n d they ' l l say, ' N o t a single journal i s t? T h e 
who le quo ta i s missing? W h e r e have they gone? ' 
At least I can s h o w the h ierarchy the m a n w h o conv inced t h e m ; 
5 5 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
56 
and they escaped. A n d because i t has never h a p p e n e d be fo re—anybody 
escaping f rom paradise i n to h e l l — w e d o n ' t keep the doors closed from 
the inside. N o b o d y ever escapes; anybody can o p e n t h e m and l ook out, 
the re i s no p r o b l e m . W h o i s g o i n g to w a n t to go to hell? A n d the re i s 
no th i rd place. So the doors w e r e o p e n as always, and they escaped. They 
simply said to m e , ' G o o d - b y e , we are n o t c o m i n g back again. ' I cannot 
let y o u go ." 
B u t the journa l i s t was s t ubbo rn . He said, " T h e n I wil l go i m m e d i ­
ately to the h ierarchy and expose the w h o l e th ing : that I am n o t enti t led 
to be here , I d o n ' t have a g reen ca rd—I am jus t a t o u r i s t — a n d the gate­
keeper i s n o t a l lowing me to go out . You have c o m m i t t e d t w o crimes: 
first, y o u al lowed me in; second, you are n o t a l lowing me out . " 
T h e gatekeeper under s tood ; that was perfectly r igh t . He said, "Okay, 
y o u go. T h e census, i t takes e t e r n i t y — e v e r y t h i n g takes e t e rn i ty here. 
M e a n w h i l e m a y b e some o the r journa l i s t may t u r n up . B u t this i s strange, 
that y o u are conv inced by a r u m o r that y o u created yourself." 
He said, " W h e n ten o t h e r journal is ts believe it, there mus t be s o m e ­
t h i n g in it. S o m e par t o f i t mus t be t rue ; o the rwise h o w can y o u con ­
vince t en journal i s t s to go f rom paradise to hell? T h e r e i s b o u n d to be 
some t r u t h in it ." 
T h e leader i s con t inuous ly in n e e d of b e i n g conv inced again and 
again that w h a t he is saying is r ight . For that he needs g r o w i n g n u m b e r s 
o f c o m m i t t e d peop le . A n d the m o r e fanatically they are c o m m i t t e d , the 
m o r e conv inc ing they are to h i m . I f they are ready to die or to kill, to go 
on a crusade, do jihad, ho ly w a r — t h a t makes h i m cer ta in . 
A n d in a circular way, his cer ta in ty convinces the fol lowers—because 
he b e c o m e s louder , m o r e s t ubbo rn ; he b e c o m e s absolutely cer ta in . Ifs and 
buts disappear f rom his l a n g u a g e — w h a t e v e r he says is the truth. A n d this 
vic ious circle goes on and o n . I t makes the leader fanatic and the fol low­
ers fanatics. I t is t he psychological n e e d of b o t h ; b o t h are in the same 
boat . 
Peop le have a psychological n e e d to feel cer ta in . To have shifting 
sand con t inuous ly u n d e r n e a t h their feet makes the i r life difficult. It is 
Mind-A Pandoras Box 
difficult e n o u g h as i t i s—and t h e n all a round , unce r t a in ty and insecurity, 
all a round, p rob lems and no answers. T h i s gives an o p p o r t u n i t y to those 
few c u n n i n g peop le w h o can p re tend that 
they deal exactly in the c o m m o d i t i e s y o u 
need. T h e only qual i ty the leader needs is 
that he should always be ahead of t he 
crowd. He should be constant ly watchfu l 
of whe re the c rowd is go ing , and be ahead 
of it. T h a t keeps t he c rowd feeling that the 
leader is leading. 
T h e leader on ly has to be this clever, 
that he goes on w a t c h i n g the m o o d o f the 
people, w h e r e they are m o v i n g . W h e r e v e r 
the w i n d starts b l o w i n g the real leader 
never misses the chance: He is always ahead 
of the crowd. 
Th inke r s are n o t n e e d e d because a 
thinker wil l start w o n d e r i n g w h e t h e r t he 
way the c rowd is go ing is the r igh t course , 
or w h e t h e r the way he was g o i n g is t he 
right course. I f he starts t h i n k i n g in that 
way then he will n o t be the leader any 
longer, he wil l be a lone. T h e c rowd wi l l have m o v e d w i t h some id io t 
w h o does n o t b o t h e r t o w o n d e r abou t w h e r e they are go ing . You m a y be 
going to hell, bu t he is the l e a d e r — h e is ahead of you . T h e on ly quali ty 
in the leader that is n e e d e d is a faculty that can j u d g e the m o o d of t he 
crowd. Th i s is n o t v e r y difficult because the c r o w d is shou t ing loud ly 
what i t wants all the t ime, w h e r e i t wan t s to go, w h a t its needs are. You 
have jus t to be a little alert and p u t all these voices toge ther ; t h e n the re 
will be no p rob lem, you wi l l be ahead of t he crowd. 
A n d go on p romis ing w h a t e v e r they are asking f o r — n o b o d y wil l e x ­
pect you to fulfill y o u r promises , they are asking only to be p romised . 
W h o has asked y o u to fulfill y o u r promises? Go on g iv ing promises and 
5 7 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
d o n ' t be w o r r i e d that some day they will catch h o l d of y o u and ask about 
t h e m . T h e y never wil l , because w h e n e v e r they catch h o l d o f you , you can 
give t h e m b igger promises . 
A n d people 's m e m o r i e s are very short . W h a t y o u promised f ive years 
ago, w h o remembers? In f ive years' t ime so m u c h wate r has gone d o w n the 
Ganges, w h o bothers? In f ive years so m u c h 
has changed. D o n ' t be w o r r i e d , you jus t go 
on m a k i n g bigger and bigger promises. 
A n d p e o p l e believe in those promises, 
p e o p l e w a n t to believe. T h e y have n o t h i n g 
else, jus t hopes . So the leaders go on giving 
o p i u m , h o p e , and p e o p l e b e c o m e addicted. 
Fanatic c o m m i t m e n t to groups and 
organizat ions , poli t ical , rel igious, or any 
o t h e r k ind , is a k ind of add ic t ion—jus t like 
any o t h e r d rug . A Chr i s t i an feels at h o m e 
s u r r o u n d e d by Chr is t ians . T h a t i s add ic ­
t ion , a psychological d rug . See ing a person 
outs ide of their c rowd, s o m e t h i n g in the 
psyche of peop le immedia te ly starts t r e m ­
bl ing: a ques t ion m a r k has arisen. T h e r e is a m a n w h o does n o t believe in 
Chr i s t : " I t is possible n o t to believe in Chris t? I t is possible to survive 
w i t h o u t be l iev ing in C h r i s t ? " Suspicions, doub t s . . . 
W h y do they get angry? T h e y are n o t angry, they are really afraid. 
A n d to h ide the fear they have to projec t the anger. A n g e r is always to 
h ide fear. 
Peop le use all k inds of strategies. T h e r e are p e o p l e w h o wil l l augh 
jus t so that they can s top their tears. In l augh ing y o u wi l l forget, they wil l 
f o r g e t . . . and the tears can r e m a i n h i d d e n . In anger, the i r fear remains 
h i d d e n . 
T h e y are ve ry fanatic, defensive . . . T h e y k n o w thei r belief is n o t 
their exper ience , and they are afraid some outs ider m a y scratch, m a y dig 
deep, m a y b r i n g the w o u n d in front o f the i r eyes. S o m e h o w they have 
58 
Mind-A Pandoras Box 
been able to cover i t u p — t h e y are Chr is t ians and Chr i s t is the savior, the 
only savior, the on ly real savior, and they have the H o l y B o o k and G o d is 
wi th t h e m so w h a t is there to fear? T h e y have created a cozy p sycho log ­
ical h o m e and suddenly, like a bull in a ch ina shop, in comes a s t ranger 
w h o doesn ' t believe as they do ! 
O n e o f my teachers loved me ve ry m u c h . I n my h igh school days he 
was the o n e teacher w i t h w h o m I was v e r y in t imate . So after I w e n t to 
university, and came back to my h o m e t o w n on holidays, I w o u l d go to 
see h im . 
He said o n e day, "I wa i t for you . I t is v e r y strange that I wai t for you , 
k n o w i n g that n o w the holidays are he r e and you wil l be c o m i n g . A n d 
your c o m i n g is jus t like a fresh breeze . In my old age you r e m i n d me 
again o f my y o u t h and my youthfu l dreams. B u t w h e n you c o m e , I b e ­
come afraid and I start p ray ing to G o d : 'Let h i m go as soon as possible! ' 
Because y o u create suspicion in m e ; y o u are my greatest doub t . Just see­
ing you is e n o u g h for all my doub ts to start arising. S o m e h o w I keep 
them d o w n , bu t w i t h y o u i t i s difficult." 
He said, " I t i s s trange that jus t y o u r c o m i n g i n t o my house i s e n o u g h 
and all my efforts at repression fail and all my doub ts stand up . I k n o w 
that I d o n ' t k n o w G o d , and I k n o w that my prayers are jus t fu t i l e—there 
is n o b o d y to hear t h e m . Still I go on d o i n g t h e m three t imes a day: 
m o r n i n g , a f te rnoon , evening . B u t w h e n y o u are he re t h e n I c a n n o t do 
my prayers as peacefully as I do every o t h e r day." 
I said, " B u t I never d is turb y o u r prayers!" 
He said, " I t i s n o t that you dis turb t h e m . B u t i f you are j u s t si t t ing 
here and I am d o i n g my prayer . . . i t i s impossible . Sudden ly I k n o w that

k n o w that in y o u r eyes this i s n o t in te l l igent , w h a t I am d o i n g . A n d the 
trouble is, that deep d o w n I agree w i t h y o u . B u t n o w I am too old and I 
cannot change . Fear arises. I c a n n o t stop. M a n y t imes I have t h o u g h t , 
W h y d o n ' t I s top praying? B u t I have b e e n pray ing for seventy-five 
Years . . ."

I N T E L L I G E N C E

STEPPING O U T O F THE PYRAMID 
A question: I was shocked to hear you say that the pyramid of human­
ity consists of Ayatollah Khomeini and Albert Einstein, and there is no 
qualitative difference between the two. Isn't there a third alternative? 
Mind A Pandora's Box 
I am shocked too , bu t o n e is helpless against the reality. T h e t r u t h is 
that there is no qualitative difference b e t w e e n Ayatol lah K h o m e i n i and 
Alber t Eins te in ; I w o u l d have loved to declare it if there was even a small 
possibility o f some qualitative difference. T h a t does n o t m e a n that b o t h 
are the same type of pe r son . 
Ayatol lah K h o m e i n i is a m a d m a n . A lbe r t E ins te in is a genius , the 
sharpest in te l l igence h u m a n i t y has ever p roduced . So I am n o t saying that 
they are t he same k i n d o f p e o p l e , b u t w h a t can I do? T h e y b e l o n g to 
the same range. T h e Ayatollah i s t he lowest in the l ine, Alber t E ins te in t he 
highest , b u t the difference is o n l y of degrees ; i t is t he same pyramid . 
Ayatol lah K h o m e i n i , A d o l f Hi t le r , J o s e p h Stalin, B e n i t o Musso l in i , 
M a o T s e - t u n g — t h e y are as h u m a n as A lbe r t E ins te in , B e r t r a n d Russe l l , 
J ean -Pau l Sartre, Kar l Jaspers; they b e l o n g to o n e human i ty , t o o n e m i n d . 
But Ayatol lah K h o m e i n i a n d his c o m p a n y are sick. T h e m i n d i s t he same 
bu t i t is a sick m i n d , i t is ups ide d o w n . Albe r t E ins t e in and B e r t r a n d 
Russel l are healthy. I t is t he same m i n d b u t in t he r igh t shape; i t is as i t 
should be . 
B u t I c a n n o t say that they b e l o n g to t w o different categories; that 
w o u l d be a lie. I t w o u l d be c o n s o l i n g — y o u w o u l d n o t be shocked, I 
w o u l d n o t be shocked, eve rybody w o u l d be happy. B u t t o destroy t r u t h 
for such s tupid consola t ion is n o t g o i n g to he lp anybody. 
B u t w h y do y o u l ook on ly f rom o n e side? T h e r e are m a n y aspects 
w h i c h have to be cons idered . W h y d o n ' t y o u see i t as a great revelation? 
You have t h o u g h t on ly of o n e th ing , that 's w h y y o u go t shocked . I go t 
shocked too , bu t I also go t exci ted , ecstatic. 
You t h o u g h t only of o n e th ing , that Alber t Eins te in i s r educed to the 
level of Ayatollah K h o m e i n i . B u t w h y can ' t you see the o the r possibi l i ty— 
that Ayatollah K h o m e i n i can be raised to the level of Alber t Einstein? 
I am o p e n i n g a t r e m e n d o u s possibility for these m a d peop le . A n d 
these m a d peop le have d o m i n a t e d h u m a n i t y ; s o m e t h i n g has to be done . 
H u m a n i t y as such i s n o t bad , n o t evil, b u t o n e Ayatol lah K h o m e i n i can 
drive a w h o l e c o u n t r y crazy, idiot ic .

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
T h e names , the words , the pr inciples these peop le use to h ide their 
madness and s tupidi ty are beautiful . Ayatollah K h o m e i n i recites the ho ly 
K o r a n every day. He does n o t n e e d to read; he has m e m o r i z e d i t — t h e 
w h o l e h o l y Koran . H e quo tes con t inuous ly f rom the ho ly K o r a n , and 
those w h o are l i s tening to h i m and fo l lowing h i m believe that he is a 
p rophe t , a messenger of G o d sent to he lp Islam succeed. Tha t ' s w h a t all 
the rel igions believe: I f they succeed, on ly t h e n is the re any future for h u ­
mani ty ; o the rwise there i s no future, m a n is finished. A n d w h a t he i s d o ­
ing is so barbarous , so ugly, so i n h u m a n . . . Peop le are b e i n g s laughtered 
cont inuously , b e h e a d e d cont inuously . Peop le are b e i n g bea t en to dea th 
on the crossroads before thousands of spec ta to r s—and all those spectators 
are re jo ic ing because this is t he success of Islam. 
Ayatol lah K h o m e i n i says that any th ing d o n e acco rd ing to the Islamic 
pr inciples i s r igh t . T h e r e i s no o t h e r way, no o t h e r c r i t e r i on to dec ide 
r igh t and w r o n g . To behead a m a n is Islamic. I f the m a n is n o t wi l l ing to 
b e c o m e a M o h a m m e d a n t h e n i t is be t t e r he shou ld die. Liv ing as a n o n -
M o h a m m e d a n is wor se than dy ing , because dea th m a y change his life 
pa t t e rn . Perhaps in this body, in this m i n d , he is incapable of b e c o m i n g a 
M o h a m m e d a n , so this b o d y and m i n d have to be destroyed. T h e s e are 
h indrances to his salvation. A n d to die by the hands of Islamic soldiers is 
a g lory in itself. You shou ld be p roud : You at ta ined a great dea th . You 
cou ld n o t at tain a great life bu t y o u a t ta ined a great dea th . So the pe r son 
w h o is b e i n g ki l led by the Islamic murde re r s i s for tunate . A n d the peop le 
w h o are ki l l ing h i m are also ea rn ing great v i r tue , because there i s no 
o the r m o t i v e — t h e y are t r y ing to help the m a n , to t ransform his be ing . 
T h e y are m a k i n g the way to G o d clear and clean for t he p e r s o n . T h e y 
are d o i n g God ' s w o r k : T h e y wi l l be b o r n as saints in paradise. So b o t h are 
benefi ted. H o w can s o m e t h i n g b e w r o n g and evil w h e n b o t h parties are 
immense ly benef i ted, spiritually benefi ted? 
Do y o u see the cunningness of people? B u t this Ayatollah has the same 
m i n d as y o u have, i t is jus t that i t has gone nuts. B u t i t can be repaired. 
T h i s is h a p p e n i n g all over the w o r l d . . . Just the o the r day in the 
Vatican o n e w o m a n j u m p e d f rom St. Peter 's bas i l ica—the highest c h u r c h

Mind A Pandora's Box 
i n C h r i s t e n d o m — a n d kil led herself. N o b o d y k n o w s why, and perhaps 
n o b o d y wil l ever k n o w why. B u t w h e n I heard this, the i m m e d i a t e r e ­
sponse that came to me was that this w o m a n has declared s o m e t h i n g sig­
nificant. T h e w h o l e o f h u m a n i t y i s g o i n g to die in the Vatican, j u m p i n g 
from St. Peter 's basilica. T h i s w o m a n is a p ioneer . She has s imply said 
that this i s go ing to h a p p e n to the w h o l e of humani ty . A n d they are d o ­
ing e v e r y t h i n g — t h e p o p e , t he cardinals, t he b ishops , the p r i e s t s—to e n ­
courage this to happen . 
A v e r y respected h u m a n i t a r i a n , a Ca tho l i c n u n , Sister J u d i t h 
Vaughan, was expel led f rom the Ca tho l i c chu rch . In Cal i fornia she was 
r u n n i n g a shelter for p o o r w o m e n , a b a n d o n e d w o m e n , re jected w o m e n . 
A n d she he lped thousands of w o m e n . B u t all h e r life's w o r k i s n o t h i n g ; 
she jus t c o m m i t t e d a small mistake, a mis take in the eyes of t he Chr i s t i an 
bureaucracy. She signed a newspape r adver t i sement in favor of a b o r t i o n 
rights. T h e newspaper h a d asked those w h o w e r e in favor to sign and 
send the adver t i sement b a c k to the newspaper , so they cou ld say that n o t 
all Chr is t ians are against the r igh t to abor t ion . Sister J u d i t h s igned i t — 
and that is a great sin. 
T h e w o m a n w o r k e d he r w h o l e life, served thousands o f w o m e n , was 
respected all over Cal ifornia , and she unders tands t he p rob lems of 
w o m e n — a b o r t i o n , chi ldren, o r p h a n s — m o r e than those idiots w h o e x ­
pelled he r f rom the c h u r c h . N o t on ly did they expell h e r f rom the 
church , they p reven ted h e r f rom e n t e r i n g t he shelter that she created for 
poor w o m e n , for suffering w o m e n . She was n o t a l lowed to en t e r the 
church or the shelter, and she is no l onge r a n u n . N o b o d y cares that w h a t 
she was d o i n g was h u m a n i t a r i a n . 
M o r e popu l a t i on means m o r e p r o b l e m s — a n d y o u are n o t able t o 
solve the p rob lems that are present . E a c h child br ings thousands of p r o b ­

should have disappeared f rom the w o r l d l o n g b e f o r e — w h a t to say ab o u t

In A m e r i c a there are mil l ions and mil l ions of illiterate adults. In the

every way at the t o p — m i l l i o n s of adults are still u n e d u c a t e d , they can ' t

In a gas exp los ion in B h o p a l thousands of p e o p l e d ied . All the

go ing to affect the fetus so severely. A n d this was on ly a small explos ion . 
W h e n y o u r nuc lea r explos ions and a tomic explos ions start h a p p e n i n g , 
h o w they are g o i n g to affect y o u is un imag inab le . A n d i t wil l n o t affect 
on ly you; i t wi l l affect all the genera t ions that fol low y o u . It wil l affect 
the w h o l e future o f humani ty . 
W h o i s crea t ing these problems? T h e m i n d . T h e same m i n d can 
solve t h e m . 
So w h e n I say Ayatol lah K h o m e i n i and Albe r t E ins te in b e l o n g to the 
same l ine . . . i f y o u t h i n k that A lbe r t E ins te in i s also like Ayatollah 
K h o m e i n i y o u wi l l get on ly a shock. B u t i f y o u also t h i n k that Ayatollah 
K h o m e i n i has the capacity to be an Alber t E ins te in t h e n y o u wil l be e x ­
ci ted like m e . 
B u t I have talked on ly abou t the py ramid of t he m i n d . I have n o t 
ta lked abou t peop le w h o have d r o p p e d ou t o f the m i n d , I have n o t talked 
abou t the medi ta tors . T h e y are qualitatively different f rom b o t h . 
A m a n of med i t a t i on is as far away f rom Ayatollah K h o m e i n i as he is 
f rom Alber t Eins te in , because he is far away f rom m i n d itself. 
T h e py ramid i s on ly o f p e o p l e l iving in the m i n d , so d o n ' t be d e ­
pressed. You can j u m p ou t o f the pyramid; n o b o d y i s forc ing y o u to be in 
it. I t i s y o u r decis ion to be in i t or n o t to be in it. You can b e c o m e a 
watcher . You stand outs ide the py ramid and w a t c h the w h o l e s tupid game 
that goes o n . 
I am n o t par t of the pyramid. That ' s w h y I can talk abou t the pyramid, 
Mind A Pandora's Box 
descr ibe it in total detail f rom all aspects, because I am jus t a watcher . I 
can m o v e a r o u n d the pyramid , I can see all its faces. I can see its lowest 
dep th , I can see its highest p e a k — b e c a u s e I am n o t in it. 
If y o u are in it, t h e n i t is impossible for y o u to w a t c h i t in its totali ty; 
you have to be outs ide o f it. A n d the re have b e e n such p e o p l e d o w n the 
ages—very few, bu t that does n o t m a k e 
any difference: E v e n if a single p e r s o n can 
escape f rom the py ramid that is e n o u g h to 
prove the possibility. A n d m a n y have es ­
caped f rom it. 
Just a little effort on y o u r side, a little 
alertness, and you can slip ou t of the m i n d — 
because the py ramid i s n o t m a d e o f s o m e ­
t h i n g solid; t he b r icks i t i s m a d e o u t of 
are t hough t s . You are s u r r o u n d e d by a wal l 
of t hough t s . I t is so easy to c o m e o u t of it. 
You d o n ' t even have to d ig a ho l e in the 
wall, y o u d o n ' t even have to o p e n a door . 
You have s imply to stand silently and see 
w h e t h e r the wall really exists or on ly a p ­
pears to. 
In t he East they call i t a mi rage ; i t on ly 
appears real. T h e closer y o u c o m e to it, 
and the be t t e r y o u look at it, the m o r e i t 
starts d isappear ing. T h o u g h t s are the m o s t 
insubstantial th ings in t he wor ld ; they 
don ' t have any th ing mater ia l in t h e m . 
Your t hough t s are jus t like ghosts . You 
simply go on bel ieving in t h e m , never t ry ing to have an encoun te r , never t u r n i n g yourself toward t h e m and s tar ing 
at t hem. You wil l be s imply surpr ised that any t h o u g h t that you stare at 
simply melts away. I t c a n n o t stand y o u r watchfulness. 
So there is a th i rd al ternative. You n e e d n o t be e i ther Ayatol lah

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
K h o m e i n i a c or Alber t E ins te in . Alber t Eins te in is a good m a n , b u t g o o d 
and bad are t w o sides of t he same co in . Saint and s inner are t w o sides of 
the same coin; heaven and hell, G o d and d e v i l — t w o sides of the same 
co in . N e i t h e r can exist w i t h o u t t he o ther . 
B u t the re is a th i rd a l t e rna t ive—you n e e d n o t be e i t h e r — a n d that 's 
really to be yourself. 
To be o u t o f the py ramid of the m i n d i s to en t e r i n to the t e m p l e of 
y o u r be ing . 
T h e py ramid is for the dead. Actual ly the pyramids were m a d e as 
graves for Egyp t i an kings and queens . T h e y are graveyards; and w h e n I 
used the w o r d pyramid for the m i n d I used it knowingly . M i n d is also a 
graveyard o f dead th ings , past m e m o r i e s , exper iences , shadows . . . all 
shadows. B u t by and by they b e c o m e so th ick that they create a dark cu r ­
tain a r o u n d y o u . 
I f you w a n t to escape f rom y o u r shadow, w h a t do y o u t h i n k y o u have 
to do? R u n ? T h e shadow wil l fol low y o u w h e r e v e r y o u go, i t wi l l be 
w i t h you ; it is y o u r shadow. A n d a shadow is nonexis tent ia l ; it is a ghost . 
T h e on ly way to get r id of i t i s to t u r n back and look a t i t and t ry to find 
w h e t h e r there is any substance in it. T h e r e is n o t h i n g ! It is pu re negat iv­
ity. I t is j u s t because y o u are s tanding in the w a y of the sun rays that the 
sun rays c a n n o t c o m e in; and the absence of sun creates the shadow. 
Exact ly this i s the s i tuat ion abou t y o u r t h o u g h t s . Because y o u are n o t 
watchful , because y o u are n o t silent, because y o u can ' t see th ings clearly 
w i t h o u t any dis turbance, t hough t s are substitutes for awareness. Unless 
you b e c o m e aware, t hough t s will con t inue . 
T h e m i n d is n o t you ; i t is s o m e b o d y else: You are on ly a watcher . 
A n d jus t a few glimpses of w a t c h i n g wil l p repare y o u to get ou t of the 
pyramid w i t h o u t any f ight ing, w i t h o u t any struggle, w i t h o u t any p r a c ­
t i ce . You s imply s tand up and get ou t . 
Peop le go on be l iev ing in any th ing that i s consolatory. T h e i r ghosts, 
the i r gods, the i r heaven and he l l—these are all j u s t consola t ions . T h e i r 
saints, ho ly m e n , sages—all consola t ion . A t r u e m a n needs guts to get ou t 
of all this ro t t en mess. A n d the on ly w a y to get ou t of i t i s to b e c o m e 
Mind A Pandora's Box 
a witness of y o u r o w n t h o u g h t processes. A n d it is easy, it is the easiest 
t h ing in the wor ld . You jus t have to do i t once ; bu t you never t ry even 
once, and y o u go on t h i n k i n g i t i s the m o s t difficult th ing . 
I also used to t h i n k that it was a v e r y difficult th ing , because that 's 
w h a t I h a d b e e n to ld by everybody, read in every b o o k — t h a t i t is such a 
great, difficult p h e n o m e n o n ; i t takes lives toge the r for a m a n to c o m e to 
the state of n o - m i n d . W h e n e v e r y b o d y is saying that, and there i s n o t 
even a single excep t ion , i t is v e r y natural that you may start be l iev ing it. 
B u t I am a little eccent r ic . My logic does n o t fol low the o rd ina ry 
course, it goes zigzag. O n c e I b e c a m e aware that eve rybody says it is dif­
ficult, every scr ip ture says i t is difficult, t he first idea that came to me was 
that i t is possible that n o b o d y has t r ied . O t h e r w i s e there w o u l d be differ­
ent op in ions . S o m e b o d y w o u l d say i t i s this difficult; s o m e b o d y w o u l d 
say it is m o r e difficult t h a n that; s o m e b o d y w o u l d say it is less difficult 
than that . I t is impossible to have u n a n i m o u s suppor t for its difficulty 
from all over the wor ld . T h e on ly possibility was that n o b o d y had t r i e d — 
but n o b o d y wants to confess one ' s ignorance . T h e n the best course i s to 
agree w i t h t he collective consensus that i t is difficult, v e r y difficult; i t 
takes lives. 
I d r o p p e d that idea. I said, " I t has to h a p p e n in this life; o the rwise I 
will n o t let it h a p p e n in any life, I wi l l s t ruggle against it. E i the r this life 
o r never." " N o w or never" b e c a m e my fixed approach , and the day I d e ­
cided " N o w or never ," i t h a p p e n e d . Since t h e n I have b e e n s imply 
amazed h o w p e o p l e have b e e n fooled. 
T h e simplest t h i n g has b e e n m a d e the m o s t i m p o s s i b l e — a n d the 
simplest t h i n g opens the d o o r for the th i rd alternative. 
I t takes you o u t of the pyramid: You are no longer a m i n d . A n d then 
only do you k n o w w h o you are. A n d to k n o w i t i s to have achieved 
every th ing w o r t h achieving.

ward . I t is the same intel l igence, on ly t he d i rec t ion changes . In science, 
the object , the o u t e r object , i s the goal of i nqu i ry ; in the spiri tual rea lm 
y o u r subjectivity, y o u r i n t e r i o r i t y is y o u r adventure . T h e inte l l igence is 
t he same. 
I f you b e c o m e an inte l lectual t h e n y o u wi l l n o t be a scientist. You

N o w the t eacher was even m o r e annoyed . H e p h o n e d the

not pu t the m i n d in a state of relaxat ion, t h e n the m i n d b e c o m e s weary,

energies are dissipated. In te l l igence needs overf lowing energies . In te l l i ­

A med i t a to r wil l be m o r e in te l l igent t h a n anybody else. A n d a m e d ­
itator wi l l be able to use his m i n d objectively and subjectively b o t h . He 
will be able to m o v e inside as easily as he is able to m o v e outside. He wi l l 
be m o r e flexible. He i s the master . He can take t he car forward, he can 
take the car backward . 
W h e n Ford m a d e his first car the re was no reverse gear in it. I t was a 
difficult p r o b l e m to c o m e back h o m e . You had to go round , y o u h a d to

yards past y o u r garage, y o u cou ld n o t back up to the ga rage—the re was 
no reverse gear. Later on i t was added . 
M e d i t a t i o n gives you a reverse gear. Ord ina r i l y you d o n ' t have it, and 
you have to go r o u n d the w o r l d again and again and still y o u c a n n o t f ind

I am n o t in favor o f those p e o p l e w h o in the past, in the n a m e of

M e d i t a t i o n does n o t m e a n go ing

T h e West has d o n e jus t the oppos i te : I t has b e c o m e ut te r ly ex t ro­

Stalin cou ld kill mil l ions of peop le easily w i t h o u t any p r i ck in his

T h a t was his p r o b l e m : h o w to coo for twelve w o m e n . E v e n to coo

FROM R E A C T I O N T O RESPONSE 
R e a c t i o n is f rom the t hough t s and response is unde r s t and ing . R e a c t i o n 
comes f rom the past; response is always in the present . B u t ord inar i ly we

He m a y have s imply revealed a t r u t h to y o u and that 's w h y y o u feel i n ­

B u t y o u have to l ook in to the p e r s o n — i f he i s r ight , y o u have to t h a n k

toward you , he has b e e n fr iendly by b r i n g i n g a t r u t h to y o u r hear t . 
Maybe it hur ts , bu t that is n o t his fault. 
O r m a y b e h e i s s imply stupid, ignoran t . N o t k n o w i n g any th ing

it. You can laugh at it, at the w h o l e absurdi ty of it. I t is r id icu lous . 
Or the pe r son is ju s t nasty and that is his way. He is insul t ing to 
everybody. So he is n o t d o i n g any th ing to y o u in part icular ; he is s imply

S o m e b o d y insul ted B u d d h a . Hi s disciple A n a n d a said, " I was ge t t ing

C o o l d o w n . T h e r e i s no n e e d to be a n g r y — b e c a u s e anger i s fire. W h y

" T h a t mus t m a k e h e r very happy," said his f r iend. 
" N o , i t has no t . N o w , every t ime she begins to talk to m e , 
she can ' t t h i n k of a n y t h i n g to say." 
Peop le live mechan ica l , robot l ike lives. I f y o u r wife has b e e n c o n t i n ­

O n e w o m a n said t o m e that she d idn ' t w a n t he r h u s b a n d t o b e p e r ­

W a t c h yourself, w a t c h others , and see h o w they are b e h a v i n g in a

R e a c t i o n is of the m i n d ; response is of the n o - m i n d . 
From Mind To No Mind 
FROM BELIEF TO FAITH 
Belief i s of the m i n d , of t he t h ink ing ; faith is of n o - m i n d , of awareness, 
unde r s t and ing . 
I t h a p p e n e d in a hillside vil lage: the h u n t e r said to his guide , 
" T h i s seems to be a v e r y dangerous cliff. It's a w o n d e r they 
d o n ' t pu t up a w a r n i n g sign." 
" T h e y h a d o n e up for t w o years ," the native gu ide a d m i t ­
ted, " b u t no o n e fell off t he cliff so they t o o k i t d o w n . " 
Bel ief i s b l i n d — y o u bel ieve because y o u have been taught to believe, 
bu t i t never goes v e r y deep because i t has no unde r s t and ing of the s i tua­
t ion. I t is j u s t a superfluous tag, j u s t s o m e t h i n g added to you . I t has n o t 
g r o w n f rom you , i t has n o t b e e n a g r o w t h of y o u r unde r s t and ing . I t i s 
just b o r r o w e d , so i t never penet ra tes y o u r be ing . For a few days you ca r ry 
it, and t h e n seeing that i t is useless and n o t h i n g is happen ing , y o u pu t i t 
aside. T h e r e are Chr is t ians w h o are n o t Chr is t ians ; the re are H i n d u s w h o 
are n o t H i n d u s . T h e y are H i n d u s on ly because of those beliefs that they 
have never used, those beliefs that they have never respected. T h e y t h i n k 
they are Chr is t ians , H i n d u s , M o h a m m e d a n s , bu t h o w can y o u be a M o ­
h a m m e d a n i f y o u have n o t lived y o u r belief? 
B u t the t r u t h is that bel ief cannot be lived. If o n e starts b e c o m i n g 
m o r e alert, w a t c h i n g life, r e spond ing , t h e n by and by a faith arises. Faith 
is yours ; belief is s o m e b o d y else's. D r o p beliefs so that faith can arise. A n d 
don ' t be satisfied w i t h beliefs, o the rwise faith wil l never arise. 
FROM S Y M P A T H Y T O C O M P A S S I O N 
Sympathy is of the m i n d : You feel s o m e b o d y is in t rouble , s o m e b o d y is in 
misery; y o u t h i n k s o m e b o d y i s in m i s e r y and you have to help. You have 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
84 
b e e n taught to help, to be of service, to be dutiful , to be a good h u m a n 
be ing , to be a good ci t izen, to be this and that . You have b e e n taught , so 
you feel sympathy. 
C o m p a s s i o n has n o t h i n g to do w i t h y o u r teachings . C o m p a s s i o n 
arises as an empathy, n o t as a sympathy. C o m p a s s i o n arises w h e n you can 
see the o t h e r pe r son as he is, and w h e n y o u can see h i m so totally that 
you start feeling h i m . You start feeling in the same s i tuat ion. 
I t h a p p e n e d : R a m a k r i s h n a was m o v i n g f rom o n e b a n k to ano the r o f 
the Ganges , near Dakshineshwar . On the o the r shore, a few peop le had 
s u r r o u n d e d a f i sherman and they w e r e bea t ing h i m . R a m a k r i s h n a was in 
the m i d d l e o f the river. He started c r y i n g and w e e p i n g , and he started 
shou t ing , "S top , d o n ' t bea t m e ! " T h e p e o p l e w h o w e r e si t t ing a round 
h i m , in the boa t , his disciples, cou ld n o t believe w h a t was happen ing : 
" W h o i s bea t ing y o u ? " they said. " W h a t are y o u saying, have y o u gone 
m a d ? " He said, " L o o k ! T h e y are bea t ing me there on the o the r side." 
T h e n they looked; they saw that the p e o p l e w e r e bea t ing the m a n . 
A n d R a m a k r i s h n a said, " L o o k a t my back ." He u n c o v e r e d his b a c k — 
there w e r e marks on his back , he was b leed ing . I t was impossible to b e ­
lieve. T h e disciples rushed to the o t h e r shore, caugh t h o l d o f the m a n 
w h o was bea t en and uncove red his back: He h a d exactly the same marks . 
T h i s is e m p a t h y — p u t t i n g oneself i n t o s o m e b o d y else's place so t o ­

T h e basic, m o s t essential t h i n g to r e m e m b e r — b e c a u s e i t divides your

From Mind To No Mind 
of t hough t s is the w o r l d of belief, t h i n k i n g , sympathy. I f you are l o o k i n g 
w i t h clean eyes, u n c l o u d e d eyes, y o u r pe rcep t ion has a clarity. It is pure , 
jus t seeing in to th ings as they are, n o t p ro jec t ing any th ing u p o n t h e m . 
T h e n y o u have unde r s t and ing , t h e n y o u have med i t a t ion . T h e n the 
w h o l e w o r l d changes . A n d the p r o b l e m is that m i n d can deceive you . I t 
creates sympathy. It creates false coins : In place of compass ion it creates 
sympathy. Sympa thy is a false co in . In place of c o m m u n i o n it has on ly 
c o m m u n i c a t i o n , w h i c h is a false co in . Instead of faith it has belief, w h i c h 
is a false co in . 
R e m e m b e r i t — t h e m i n d tries t o substi tute. Are you lack ing s o m e ­
thing? T h e m i n d tries to subst i tute for it. Be ve ry alert, because w h a t e v e r 
the m i n d can do is g o i n g to be false. M i n d is the great falsifier, the grea t ­
est deceiver there is. I t helps, i t tr ies to console you , i t gives y o u s o m e ­
th ing false so that you no l o n g e r h a n k e r for the real. 
For example , i f d u r i n g the day y o u have fasted, in the n igh t y o u wi l l 
dream of food, d i n i n g in great restaurants, or b e i n g invi ted to the palaces 
o f the kings and ea t ing beaut i ful food. W h y ? T h e w h o l e day y o u have 
been hung ry , n o w i t is difficult to sleep b e ­
cause of the h u n g e r ; the m i n d creates a 
substitute, a d ream. Have y o u n o t w a t c h e d 
it? In t he n igh t y o u r b ladder is full and y o u 
would like to go to the b a t h r o o m , b u t i f 
you do y o u r sleep wil l be d i s t u r b e d — t h e 
mind immedia te ly creates a d r e a m that y o u 
are in the b a t h r o o m . T h e n you can go on 
sleeping. I t gives you a subst i tute . T h e s u b ­
stitute is a consola t ion . It is n o t real, b u t for 
the t ime be ing i t helps. 
So beware of mind ' s consola t ions . 
Seek reality, because on ly reality can fulfill 
you. Conso la t ions can never be fulfilling. 
You can eat as m u c h food as you like in y o u r dreams, y o u can enjoy the 
fragrance of it, the taste of it, t he co lo r of it, e v e r y t h i n g — b u t i t is n o t 
85 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
86 
g o i n g to be n o u r i s h i n g . Belief can give y o u the w h o l e fragrance of faith, 
the taste, the color . You can enjoy i t b u t i t wi l l n o t n o u r i s h you . O n l y 
faith can nou r i sh . 
Always r e m e m b e r : T h a t w h i c h nour i shes y o u i s real, and that w h i c h 
simply gives y o u a conso la t ion is v e r y dangerous . Because of this c o n s o ­
la t ion y o u wi l l n o t seek the real food. I f y o u start l iving in dreams and 
y o u d o n ' t eat real food, t h e n by and by y o u wi l l dissipate, disappear, b e ­
c o m e dry, and you wi l l be dead. 
So take i m m e d i a t e ac t ion: W h e n e v e r t he m i n d i s t r y ing to give you 
a substi tute, d o n ' t l isten to it. It is a great salesman, a great seducer. It 
convinces you , i t says, " T h e s e th ings are cheap. Fai th is v e r y difficult to 
f ind because y o u wi l l have to risk y o u r life; bel ief is easy, v e r y cheap. You 
can get i t for n o t h i n g . " In fact, so m a n y p e o p l e are r eady—if y o u accept 
their belief they are ready to give y o u s o m e t h i n g m o r e w i t h it: B e c o m e a

Faith is dangerous , never cheap. U n d e r s t a n d i n g is dangerous , never

T H E MASTER A N D THE SERVANT 
I have heard an ancient s tory: 
A k i n g was v e r y happy w i t h o n e of his servants. He was so devoted, 
so totally devo ted to the k ing; he was always ready to sacrifice his life for 
the k ing . T h e k i n g was immense ly happy, and m a n y t imes he h a d saved 
the k ing , r i sk ing his o w n life. He was the k ing 's bodygua rd . 
O n e day the k i n g was feeling so happy w i t h t he m a n , he said, " I f you 
desire any th ing , if y o u have any desire, jus t tell me and I wi l l fulfill it. You 
have d o n e so m u c h for me that I can never s h o w my gra t i tude , I can 
From Mind To No Mind 
never repay you , b u t today I w o u l d like to fulfill any of y o u r wishes , 
wha t soever i t is." 
T h e servant said, "You have already given me too m u c h . I am so 
blessed jus t by b e i n g always w i t h y o u — I d o n ' t n e e d any th ing . " 
B u t t he k i n g insisted. T h e m o r e the servant said, " T h e r e i s no 
need , " t he m o r e t he k i n g insisted. Final ly the servant said, " T h e n it 's 
okay. You m a k e me the k ing for twen ty - fou r hours and you be the guard ." 
T h e k i n g was a little apprehensive, afraid, bu t he was a m a n of his 
w o r d and he h a d to fulfill the desire. So for twen ty - fou r h o u r s he b e c a m e 
the guard and the guard b e c a m e the k ing . A n d do y o u k n o w w h a t the 
guard did? T h e first t h i n g that he did , he o rde red the k ing to be kil led, 
sentenced to death! 
T h e k i n g said, " W h a t are y o u d o i n g ? " 
He said, "You keep quiet! You are s imply the guard a n d n o t h i n g 
more . I t i s my wi sh and n o w I am the k ing ! " 
T h e k i n g was killed, and the servant b e c a m e the k i n g forever. 
Servants have the i r o w n devious ways to b e c o m e masters . 
T h e m i n d i s o n e o f the m o s t beautiful , the m o s t c o m p l e x , the m o s t

T h i s i s the p r o b l e m — n o t that the m i n d has to be t h r o w n out . I f y o u 
throw the m i n d ou t you wi l l go insane. W i t h o u t the m i n d there i s on ly

I have heard that a m a n — i t mus t be some s tory f rom the f u t u r e — a

A s tory: 
The student Doko came to the master 
and asked, "In what state of mind should 
I seek the truth?" 
The master replied, "There is no 
mind, so you cannot put it in any state, and there is no truth, so you 
cannot seek it." 
Doko said, "If there is no mind and no truth, why do all these stu­
dents gather before you every day to study?" 
The master looked around and said, "I don't see anyone." 
The inquirer asked, "Then who are you teaching?" 
"I have no tongue, so how can I teach?" replied the master. 
Then Doko said sadly, "I cannot follow you; I cannot understand." 
The master said, "I don't understand myself." 
Life is such a mystery, no o n e can unde r s t and it, and o n e w h o claims 
that he unders tands i t is s imply ignoran t . He is n o t aware of w h a t he is 
89 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
90 
saying, of w h a t nonsense he is ta lking. If y o u are wise, this wil l be the 
first realization: Life c a n n o t be unde r s tood . U n d e r s t a n d i n g is impossible. 
O n l y this m u c h can be u n d e r s t o o d — t h a t u n d e r s t a n d i n g i s impossible. 
T h a t i s w h a t this beaut i ful Z e n anecdo te says. 
T h e mas ter says, "I d o n ' t unde r s t and i t myself." I f y o u go and ask the 
en l igh tened ones this wi l l be their answer. B u t i f y o u go and ask the u n ­
en l igh tened ones they wi l l give y o u m a n y answers, they wil l p ropose 
m a n y doctrines; they will t ry to solve the mystery w h i c h canno t be solved. 
It is n o t a r iddle . A r iddle can be solved, a mys te ry is unsolvable by its 
v e r y n a t u r e — t h e r e is no way to solve it. Socrates said, " W h e n I was 
y o u n g , I t h o u g h t I k n e w m u c h . W h e n I b e c a m e old, r ipe in w i s d o m , I 
came to unde r s t and that I k n e w n o t h i n g . " 
I t i s r e p o r t e d of o n e of the Sufi masters, J u n n a i d , that he was w o r k ­
i n g w i t h a n e w y o u n g m a n . T h e y o u n g m a n was n o t aware o f Junnaid ' s 
i nne r w i s d o m , and J u n n a i d lived such an o rd ina ry life that i t n e e d e d very 
pene t ra t ing eyes to realize that y o u w e r e near a b u d d h a . He w o r k e d like 
an o rd ina ry laborer, and on ly those w h o had eyes w o u l d recognize h im. 
To recognize B u d d h a was v e r y easy—he was si t t ing u n d e r a B o d h i tree; 
to recognize J u n n a i d was v e r y diff icul t—he was w o r k i n g like a laborer, 
n o t sit t ing u n d e r a B o d h i tree. He was in every way absolutely ordinary. 
O n e y o u n g m a n was w o r k i n g w i t h h i m , and that y o u n g m a n was 
cont inua l ly s h o w i n g his k n o w l e d g e , so wha t soeve r J u n n a i d w o u l d do, he 
w o u l d say, " T h i s is w r o n g . Th i s can be d o n e in this way, i t wi l l be better." 
He k n e w abou t eve ry th ing . Finally J u n n a i d l aughed and said, "Young 
m a n , I am n o t y o u n g e n o u g h to k n o w so m u c h . " 
Th i s i s really s o m e t h i n g . He said, " I am n o t y o u n g e n o u g h to k n o w 
so m u c h . " O n l y a y o u n g m a n can be so foolish, so inexper ienced . 
Socrates was r igh t w h e n he said, " W h e n I was y o u n g , I k n e w too m u c h . 
W h e n I b e c a m e r ipened , exper ienced , I came to realize on ly o n e t h i n g — 
that I was absolutely ignoran t . " 
Life is a mys te ry ; that means it c a n n o t be solved. A n d w h e n all efforts 
to solve i t prove futile, the mys te ry dawns u p o n you . T h e n the doors are 
open ; t h e n y o u are invi ted. As a knower , n o b o d y enters the divine; as 
From Mind To No Mind 
a child, ignoran t , n o t k n o w i n g at all, the mys t e ry embraces you . W i t h a 
k n o w i n g m i n d you are clever, n o t i n n o c e n t . I nnocence i s the door . 
T h i s Z e n mas ter was r igh t w h e n he said, " I d o n ' t unde r s t and i t m y ­
self." It was v e r y deep, really deep, the deepest answer possible. B u t this is 
the last pa r t of the anecdo te . Start f rom the v e r y b e g i n n i n g . . . 
T h e disciple came to the Z e n mas te r and said, " I n w h a t state o f 
mind shou ld I seek the t r u t h ? " T h e mas ter said, " T h e r e i s no m i n d so 
there c a n n o t be any state of m i n d . " 
M i n d is the i l lusion, that w h i c h is n o t b u t appears to be, and appears 
to be so m u c h that you t h i n k that y o u are the m i n d . M i n d is maya, m i n d 
is jus t a d ream, m i n d is ju s t a p ro jec t ion . . . a soap bubb le f loating on a 
river. T h e sun is ju s t r is ing, the rays pene t ra te the bubb le ; a r a i n b o w is 
created and n o t h i n g i s there in it. W h e n y o u t o u c h the b u b b l e i t i s b r o ­
ken and eve ry th ing d i sappears—the r a in ­
bow, the b e a u t y — n o t h i n g is left. O n l y 
emptiness b e c o m e s o n e w i t h the inf ini te 
emptiness. Just a wall was there , a b u b b l e 
wall. Your m i n d is ju s t a b u b b l e w a l l — 
inside, y o u r emptiness ; outside, my e m p t i ­
ness. It is j u s t a bubb le , p r i c k it, and the 
mind disappears. 
T h e mas ter said, " T h e r e i s no m i n d , so 
what type of state are y o u asking a b o u t ? " 
It is difficult to unders tand . Peop le c o m e 
to me a n d they say, " W e w o u l d like to 
attain a silent state of m i n d . " T h e y t h i n k 
that the m i n d can be silent; m i n d can never 
be silent. M i n d means t he t u r m o i l , the il l­
ness, the disease; m i n d means t he tense, 
the anguished state. T h e m i n d c a n n o t be 
silent. W h e n there i s silence the re i s no m i n d . W h e n silence comes , m i n d 
disappears; w h e n m i n d i s there , silence i s no m o r e . So there c a n n o t be 
any silent m i n d , ju s t as there c a n n o t be any heal thy disease. Is i t possible 
91 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
92 
to have a hea l thy disease? W h e n hea l th is there , disease disappears. Silence 
is the i n n e r heal th; m i n d is the i n n e r disease, i n n e r d is turbance. 
So the re c a n n o t be any silent m i n d , and this disciple is asking, " W h a t 
type, w h a t sort, w h a t state of m i n d shou ld I achieve?" Po in t -b lank , the 
mas ter said, " T h e r e is no m i n d , so y o u c a n n o t achieve any state." So 
please d rop this i l lusion; d o n ' t t r y to achieve any state in t he i l lusion. It's 
as i f y o u are t h i n k i n g to travel on the r a i n b o w and y o u ask m e , " W h a t 
steps should we take to travel on the r a inbow?" I say, " T h e r e is no rainbow. 
T h e r a i n b o w is ju s t an appearance, so no steps can be taken ." A r a inbow 
simply appears; it is n o t there . It is n o t a reality, it is a false in te rpre ta t ion 
of the reality. 
T h e m i n d is n o t y o u r reality; i t is a false in te rp re ta t ion . You are no t 
the m i n d , y o u have never b e e n a m i n d , y o u can never be the m i n d . T h a t 
i s y o u r p r o b l e m — y o u have b e c o m e ident if ied w i t h s o m e t h i n g w h i c h i s 
n o t . You are like a beggar w h o believes that he has a k i n g d o m . He is so 
w o r r i e d abou t t he k i n g d o m — h o w to m a n a g e it, h o w to govern it, h o w 
to prevent anarchy. T h e r e i s no k i n g d o m , b u t he i s w o r r i e d . 
C h u a n g T z u o n c e d reamt that he h a d b e c o m e a butterfly. In the 
m o r n i n g he was v e r y m u c h depressed. H i s fr iends asked, " W h a t has h a p ­
pened? We have never seen y o u so depressed." C h u a n g T z u said, " I am in 
a puzzle, I am at a loss, I c a n n o t unders tand . In the n igh t , w h i l e asleep, I 
d reamt that I h a d b e c o m e a butterfly." 
So the friends l aughed . " N o b o d y i s ever d i s tu rbed by dreams. W h e n 
y o u awake, the d r e a m has disappeared, so w h y are y o u d i s tu rbed?" 
C h u a n g T z u said, " T h a t i s n o t the p o i n t . N o w I am puzzled: I f 
C h u a n g T z u can b e c o m e a butterfly in the d ream, i t i s possible that now 
the but terf ly has g o n e to sleep and is d r e a m i n g that she is C h u a n g Tzu." 
I f C h u a n g T z u can b e c o m e a butterfly in the d ream, w h y n o t the other? 
T h e butterfly can d r e a m and b e c o m e C h u a n g T z u . So w h a t i s real— 
w h e t h e r C h u a n g T z u d reamt that he has b e c o m e a butterfly, o r t he but­
terfly is d r e a m i n g that she has b e c o m e C h u a n g T z u ? W h a t is real? 
R a i n b o w s are there . You can b e c o m e a butterf ly in t he d ream. A n d you 
have b e c o m e a m i n d in this b igger d r e a m y o u call life. W h e n y o u awaken 
you d o n ' t achieve an awakened state of m i n d , y o u achieve a no-s ta te of 
m i n d , y o u achieve n o - m i n d . 
W h a t does n o - m i n d mean? I t i s difficult to follow. B u t somet imes , 
unknowing ly , y o u have achieved it. You m a y n o t have r ecogn ized it. 
S o m e t imes, j u s t si t t ing ordinarily, n o t d o i n g anyth ing , there i s no t h o u g h t 
in the m i n d — b e c a u s e m i n d is ju s t the process of t h ink ing . I t is n o t a s u b ­
stance, i t is j u s t a procession. You are he re in this a u d i t o r i u m w h e r e I am 
speaking. I can say a c rowd is here , b u t is there really s o m e t h i n g like a 
crowd? Is a c rowd substantial, or are on ly individuals here? By and by i n ­
dividuals wi l l go away, t h e n wil l there be any c rowd left beh ind? W h e n 
individuals have gone , the re is no c rowd. 
T h e m i n d i s ju s t like a c rowd; t h o u g h t s are the individuals . A n d b e ­
cause though t s are there cont inuously , you 
th ink the process is substantial . D r o p each 
individual t h o u g h t and finally n o t h i n g 
is left. 
T h e r e is no m i n d as such, on ly 
th ink ing . 
T h e t hough t s are m o v i n g so fast that 
be tween t w o t hough t s y o u c a n n o t see the 
interval. B u t t he interval is always there . 
T h a t interval i s you . In that interval the re 
i s ne i ther C h u a n g T z u n o r the bu t t e r f ly— 
because t he butterf ly is a sor t of m i n d and 
C h u a n g T z u is also a sort of m i n d . A 
butterfly is a different c o m b i n a t i o n of 
thoughts , C h u a n g T z u again a different 
combina t ion , b u t b o t h are minds . W h e n 
the m i n d i s n o t there , w h o are y o u — 
C h u a n g T z u or a butterfly? Ne i the r . A n d 
what is the state? Are you in an en l igh t ­
ened state of m i n d ? I f you t h i n k y o u are in an en l igh tened state of m i n d 
this is again a t h o u g h t , and w h e n thought is there you are no t . If you feel 
93 
tha t y o u are a b u d d h a , this is a t h o u g h t . T h e m i n d has en te red ; n o w the 
process of t h i n k i n g is there , again the sky is c louded , the blueness lost. 
You can no l onge r see the infini te blueness. 
B e t w e e n t w o though t s , t r y to be a l e r t—look i n t o the interval , the 
space in b e t w e e n . You wil l see no m i n d ; that is y o u r na ture . Because 
t hough t s c o m e a n d g o — t h e y are acc iden ta l—but that i n n e r space always 
remains . C l o u d s ga ther and go, d i sappear—they are acc iden ta l—but the 
sky remains . You are the sky. 
O n c e it h a p p e n e d that a seeker came to Bayazid, a Sufi mystic, and 
asked, "Master , I am a ve ry a n g r y pe r son . A n g e r happens to me v e r y eas­
ily; I b e c o m e really m a d and I do th ings . I c a n n o t even believe later on 
that I can do such things; I am n o t in my senses. So, h o w to d rop this 
anger, h o w to o v e r c o m e it, h o w to con t ro l i t ?" 
Bayazid t o o k the head of the disciple in his hands and looked i n t o his 
eyes. T h e disciple b e c a m e a l i t t le uneasy, and Bayazid said, " W h e r e is that 
anger? I w o u l d like to see i n to it." 
T h e disciple l aughed uneasily and said, " R i g h t now, I am n o t angry. 
Somet imes i t happens . " So Bayazid said, " T h a t w h i c h happens somet imes 
c a n n o t be y o u r na ture . I t is an accident . I t c o m e s a n d goes. I t is like 
c louds—so w h y be w o r r i e d abou t the clouds? T h i n k o f t he sky w h i c h i s 
always there . " 
T h i s is t he def in i t ion of consciousness, atma, the Se l f—the sky 
w h i c h is always there . All that comes and goes is irrelevant; d o n ' t be 
b o t h e r e d by it, i t i s j u s t smoke . T h e sky that remains e ternal ly there never 
changes , never b e c o m e s different. B e t w e e n t w o though t s , d rop i n t o it; 
b e t w e e n t w o t hough t s i t i s always there . L o o k in to i t and sudden ly you 
wi l l realize that y o u are in n o - m i n d . 
T h e mas te r was r igh t w h e n he said, " T h e r e i s no m i n d , so there can­
n o t be any state o f m i n d . W h a t nonsense are y o u ta lk ing?" 
B u t t he n o n s e n s e has its o w n logic . I f y o u t h i n k that y o u have a 
m i n d , y o u wi l l start t h i n k i n g in t e r m s o f " s t a t e s " — a n i g n o r a n t state o f 
m i n d , a n e n l i g h t e n e d state o f m i n d . O n c e y o u accep t m i n d , o n c e you 
accept t he i l lusory, y o u are b o u n d t o go on d i v i d i n g it. A n d o n c e you 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
From Mind To No Mind 
accep t tha t t he m i n d exists, y o u wi l l start seek ing s o m e t h i n g o r o the r . 
T h e m i n d can exist on ly i f y o u keep seeking s o m e t h i n g . W h y ? Seek­
ing is desire, seeking is m o v i n g in to the future, seeking creates d reams . So 
s o m e b o d y is seeking power , poli t ics, s o m e b o d y is seeking r iches , k i n g ­
d o m s , and t h e n s o m e b o d y is seeking the t ru th . B u t seeking is there , and 
seeking is the p r o b l e m , n o t what y o u are seeking. T h e object is never the 
p rob lem, any object wil l do. T h e m i n d can h a n g on to any object . A n y 
excuse is e n o u g h for i t to exist. 
T h e mas te r said, " T h e r e i s no state o f m i n d because there i s no 
m i n d . A n d there i s no t ru th , so w h a t are you ta lking about? T h e r e can be 
no seeking." 
T h i s is o n e of the greatest messages ever delivered. I t is ve ry difficult; 
the disciple c a n n o t conceive that the re i s no t ru th . W h a t does this mas ter 
m e a n w h e n he says that there i s no t ru th? D o e s he m e a n that there i s no 
t ru th? 
N o , he i s saying that for you , w h o are a seeker, the re can be no t ru th . 
Seeking always leads i n to t he u n t r u e . O n l y a n o n s e e k i n g m i n d realizes 
that w h i c h is. W h e n e v e r y o u seek, y o u have missed that w h i c h is. Seek ­
ing always moves i n to the future, seeking c a n n o t be here a n d now. H o w 
can y o u seek he re and n o w ? H e r e and now, y o u can on ly be. Seek ing is 
des i re—future enters , t ime comes i n — a n d this m o m e n t , this he re and 
n o w is missed. T r u t h is here , now. 
I f y o u go to a b u d d h a and ask, "Is there G o d ? " he wi l l d e n y i t i m ­
mediately: " T h e r e is no G o d . " If he says there is, he creates a seeker; if he 
says there i s G o d , you wil l start seeking. H o w can y o u r ema in qu ie t w h e n 
there i s G o d to be sought? W h e r e shou ld y o u r u n to find h i m ? You have 
created a n o t h e r i l lusion. 
For mil l ions of lives y o u have b e e n a seeker, after this or after that , 
this object , tha t object , this w o r l d or that wor ld , b u t a seeker. N o w y o u 
are a seeker after t r u t h bu t the mas ter says there is no t r u t h . He cuts away 
the v e r y g r o u n d o f seeking, he pulls away the v e r y g r o u n d w h e r e y o u are 
standing, w h e r e y o u r m i n d i s s tanding. He simply pushes y o u i n t o t he 
abyss. 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
T h e inqu i r e r said, " T h e n w h y are these m a n y seekers all a r o u n d you? 
I f the re i s n o t h i n g to seek and no t ru th , t h e n w h y this c r o w d ? " T h e i n ­
qui re r w e n t on miss ing the po in t . T h e mas te r l o o k e d a round and said, " I 
d o n ' t see anyone , the re i s no o n e here ." T h e inqu i r e r w e n t on miss ing the 
p o i n t because t he intel lect always goes on missing. He cou ld have looked . 
T h i s was the fact: T h e r e was no one . 
If y o u are n o t seeking y o u are not, because i t is seeking that gives you 
the ego . R i g h t this m o m e n t , i f y o u are n o t seeking anyone , any th ing , 
t h e n you are n o t h e r e — t h e r e is no crowd. I f I am n o t teaching a n y t h i n g —

Empt iness exists, a n d the bliss of pu re empt iness . Individuals disappear 
and i t b e c o m e s an oceanic consciousness. 
Individuals are there because of individual m i n d s . You have a differ­

b r o k e n . My tea flows in to y o u and y o u r tea flows i n t o m e . I t b e c o m e s an 
oceanic existence. 
T h e mas ter l o o k e d a r o u n d and said, " I d o n ' t see a n y o n e — t h e r e i s no 
o n e . " 
B u t the intel lect goes o n missing. T h e inqu i re r said, " T h e n w h o m 
are y o u teaching? I f the re i s no one , t h e n w h o m are you t each ing?" A n d 
the mas te r said, " I have go t no t o n g u e , so h o w can I t e ach?" He goes on 
g iv ing h in ts to b e c o m e alert, to look , b u t t he i nqu i r e r i s engulfed in his 
o w n m i n d . T h e mas ter goes on hi t t ing , h a m m e r i n g on his head; he i s 
ta lk ing nonsense jus t t o b r i n g h i m ou t o f his m i n d . 
I f y o u h a d b e e n there y o u w o u l d have b e e n conv inced by the in ­
quirer , n o t by the master . T h e inqu i re r w o u l d have appeared to be exactly 
r igh t . Th i s mas te r seemed to be m a d , absurd. He was talking! A n d he 
said, " T h e r e is no t o n g u e , so h o w can I ta lk?" 
96 
From Mind To No Mind 
He was saying, " L o o k a t m e , I am w i t h o u t fo rm. L o o k a t m e , I am 
n o t e m b o d i e d . T h e b o d y appears to y o u b u t I am n o t that , so h o w can I 
ta lk?" 
T h e m i n d goes on missing. T h i s i s the mise ry o f the m i n d . You push 
it, it again gathers itself; y o u h i t it, and for a m o m e n t the re is a s ink ing and 
a t r embl ing , and again it is established. 
Have you seen the Japanese doll? T h e y call i t a daruma doll . You t h r o w 
i t wha teve r way—topsy- tu rvy , upside d o w n — b u t wha teve r you do, the 
doll sits in a b u d d h a pos ture . T h e b o t t o m par t i s so heavy y o u c a n n o t do 
anyth ing . T h r o w i t in any way and the doll again sits in a b u d d h a pos ture . 
T h e n a m e daruma comes f rom B o d h i d h a r m a ; in Japan , B o d h i d h a r m a ' s 
n a m e is D a r u m a . B o d h i d h a r m a used to say that y o u r m i n d is ju s t l ike this 
doll . He w o u l d t h r o w it, k ick it, b u t wha t soever he did he cou ld n o t d is ­
tu rb the doll; the b o t t o m par t was so heavy. You t h r o w i t upside d o w n , i t 
wil l c o m e r igh t side up . 
So this mas te r w e n t on push ing . A little shaking, and the doll sat up 
straight again, missed the po in t . Finally, desperate, the i nqu i r e r said, "I 
d o n ' t follow, I d o n ' t unde r s t and . " A n d w i t h the u l t imate h i t , the mas ter 
said, "I d o n ' t unde r s t and myself." 
I go on teaching, k n o w i n g wel l there i s n o t h i n g to be taught . Tha t ' s 
w h y I can go on infinitely. I f the re w e r e s o m e t h i n g to be t augh t I w o u l d 
have finished already. B u d d h a s can go on and on because the re i s n o t h i n g 
to be t aught . I t is an endless story, i t never concludes , so I can go on and 
on . I wi l l never be finished; y o u m a y be finished before my s tory ends, 
because there is no e n d to it. 
S o m e b o d y was asking m e , " H o w d o y o u m a n a g e t o g o o n ta lking 
every day?" I said, "Because the re is n o t h i n g to be taught . " S o m e d a y y o u 
will suddenly feel i t—tha t I am n o t ta lking, that I am n o t t each ing . You 
have realized there is n o t h i n g to be t augh t because the re is no t ru th . 
W h a t discipline am I giving to you? N o n e . A disciplined m i n d is again 
a mind , even m o r e s tubborn , m o r e adamant; a disciplined m i n d is m o r e 
stupid. Go and see the disciplined m o n k s all over the wor ld—Chr i s t i an , 
H i n d u , Jain. W h e n e v e r you see a m a n w h o is absolutely disciplined you 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
will find a stupid m i n d beh ind it. T h e f lowing has s topped. He is so c o n ­
ce rned w i t h f inding someth ing that he is ready to do wha tever y o u say. If 
you say, "S tand on y o u r head for an hour , " he is ready to stand on his head. 
I t is because of desire. If G o d can be achieved only t h rough standing on his 
head for hours , he is ready, bu t he must achieve. 
I am n o t g iv ing y o u any achieving, any desir ing; the re i s n o w h e r e to 
reach and n o t h i n g to achieve. I f y o u realize this, you have achieved this 
ve ry m o m e n t . T h i s v e r y m o m e n t you are perfect; n o t h i n g i s t o be d o n e , 
n o t h i n g i s to be changed . 
Tha t ' s w h y the mas te r said, "I d o n ' t unde r s t and i t myself." I t is diffi­
cult to find a mas ter w h o says, "I d o n ' t unde r s t and i t myself." A mas ter 
has to c la im that he k n o w s , on ly t h e n wi l l you fol low h i m . A mas ter mus t 
n o t on ly c la im that he k n o w s , he m u s t c la im that only he k n o w s , n o b o d y 
else: "Al l o t h e r masters are w r o n g , I a lone know." T h e n y o u wi l l follow. 
You mus t be absolutely cer ta in , t h e n y o u b e c o m e a follower. T h e cer­
ta inty gives you the feeling that he re is the m a n , and i f y o u fol low you 
wil l reach. 
I wi l l tell y o u o n e story. I t h a p p e n e d once , a so-cal led m a s ­
ter was traveling. In every village he w o u l d go, he w o u l d d e ­
clare, "I have achieved, I have k n o w n the divine . I f y o u w a n t , 
c o m e and fol low m e . " 
Peop le w o u l d say, " T h e r e are m a n y responsibil i t ies. S o m e ­
day, we h o p e we wil l be able t o fol low you . " T h e y w o u l d t o u c h 
his feet, give h i m respect, serve h i m , b u t n o b o d y w o u l d fol low 
because there w e r e m a n y o t h e r th ings to be d o n e first before 
o n e w e n t to seek the divine. First th ings first. T h e d iv ine is a l ­
ways the last, and the last t h i n g never comes because the first are 
infini te; they are never finished. B u t in o n e village, a m a d m a n — 
he was m a d , o the rwise w h o w o u l d fol low this mas te r—said , 
" R i g h t . Have you have found G o d ? " 
T h e mas te r hesi tated a little, l o o k i n g a t the m a d m a n — 
because this m a n seemed dangerous , he m i g h t fol low and create 
98 
F r o m M i n d t o N o - M i n d 
t r o u b l e — b u t in front o f the w h o l e village he cou ldn ' t deny it, 
so he said, "Yes." 
T h e m a d m a n said, " N o w , ini t iate me . I wil l fol low y o u to 
the ve ry end . I w a n t to realize G o d myself." T h e so-cal led m a s ­
ter b e c a m e pe r tu rbed , bu t w h a t t o do? T h e m a d m a n star ted fol­
l o w i n g h i m , he b e c a m e jus t like his shadow. O n e year passed. 
T h e m a d m a n said, " H o w far, h o w far i s the t e m p l e ? " He said, " I 
am n o t i n a h u r r y b u t h o w m u c h t ime wil l be n e e d e d ? " By this 
t ime the master had b e c o m e v e r y uncomfor t ab le a n d uneasy 
w i t h this m a n . T h i s m a d m a n w o u l d sleep nex t t o h i m , h e w o u l d 
m o v e w i t h h i m ; he h a d b e c o m e his shadow. A n d because o f 
h i m , his cer ta in ty was dissolving. W h e n e v e r he w o u l d say, in a 
village, " F o l l o w m e , " he w o u l d b e c o m e afraid, because this m a n 
w o u l d l ook a t h i m and say, "I am fol lowing you , master , and still 
I have n o t reached." 
T h e second year passed, t he th i rd year passed—the sixth 
year passed, and the m a d m a n said, " W e have n o t reached a n y ­
w h e r e . We are s imply traveling to different villages and y o u go 
on tel l ing peop le , 'Fo l low m e . ' I am fo l lowing—what soeve r y o u 
say, I do it, so you c a n n o t say I am n o t fo l lowing the discipline." 
T h e m a d m a n was really m a d — w h a t e v e r was to ld to h i m he 
w o u l d do. So the mas ter c o u l d n ' t deceive h i m by saying that he 
was n o t t r y ing hard e n o u g h . Finally, o n e n ight , the mas ter said 
to h i m , "Because of y o u I have lost my o w n pa th . Before I m e t 
y o u I was cer tain; n o w I am no m o r e . N o w y o u please leave 
W h e n e v e r there i s s o m e o n e cer ta in and you are m a d e n o u g h , you 
start fo l lowing. C a n you fol low this type of m a n w h o says, " I myself 
don ' t know. I myself d o n ' t u n d e r s t a n d ? " I f y o u can fol low this m a n , you 
will reach. You have already reached i f y o u dec ide to fol low this m a n , b e ­
cause i t is the m i n d that asks for certainty, t he m i n d that asks for k n o w l ­
edge. T h e m i n d also asks for dogmat i c assertions, so i f you can be ready

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
to fol low a m a n w h o says, " I d o n ' t k n o w myself," seeking has s topped. 
N o w you are n o t asking for knowledge . 
O n e w h o i s asking for k n o w l e d g e c a n n o t ask for be ing . K n o w l e d g e 
is rubbish ; b e i n g is life. W h e n y o u stop asking for k n o w l e d g e y o u have 
s topped asking abou t t he t ru th , because t r u t h i s t he goal of k n o w l e d g e . I f 
y o u d o n ' t i nqu i re w h a t is, b u t y o u b e c o m e silent, mind le s s—tha t w h i c h 
is, is revealed. 
E v e r y t h i n g is available, has b e e n available always; y o u have never 
missed it. B u t ju s t because of y o u r seek ing—because of the future, the 
g o a l — y o u c a n n o t look . T h e t r u t h su r rounds you , y o u exist in it. Jus t like 
t he fish exist in t he ocean , y o u exist in the t ru th . Godliness is n o t a goal, 
godliness is w h a t is he re and now. These trees, these w i n d s b lowing , these 
c louds m o v i n g , t he sky, you , I—th is is w h a t godliness is. It is n o t a goal. 
D r o p the m i n d and the god. G o d is n o t an object , i t is a merger . T h e 
m i n d resists a merger , the m i n d is against su r render ; the m i n d is v e r y c u n ­
n i n g and calculat ing. 
Th i s s tory is beautiful . You are the inquirer . You have c o m e to ac­
quire k n o w l e d g e , to solve the mystery, and I repeat to you : T h e r e is no 
state of m i n d , because there i s no m i n d . T h e r e i s no t r u t h , so no seeking 
makes any sense. All seeking is futile; search as such is foolish. Seek and 
y o u wil l lose. D o n ' t seek and i t i s there . R u n and y o u wi l l miss. S t o p — i t

A n d d o n ' t t r y t o unde r s t and—be . 
B e c o m e ignoran t , b e c o m e like a child. O n l y the hea r t of a chi ld can

All k inds of cond i t ion ings are poisons . To t h i n k of oneself as a

T h i n k of yourself only as a h u m a n be ing . If you have any intell igence, 
think of yourself only as a s imple h u m a n being. A n d w h e n y o u r intel l i­

systems, because there are no great ideological systems. No idea i s great 
e n o u g h to con ta in a h u m a n be ing ; b e i n g - h o o d c a n n o t be c o n t a i n e d by

D o n ' t be a Ca tho l i c and d o n ' t be a c o m m u n i s t , j u s t be a h u m a n b e ­

Your b o d y is n o t po i soned as m u c h as y o u r m i n d is. T h e b o d y is a

B u t the p r o b l e m arises w i t h psycho l ­

T h e real f r eedom is f r eedom f rom any 
ideology. C a n ' t y o u s imply live w i t h o u t 
any ideology? Is an ideo logy needed? W h y 
is an ideology needed so m u c h ? It is needed 
because it helps y o u to r ema in stupid, i t is 
n e e d e d because i t helps y o u to r e m a i n u n ­
intel l igent . It is n e e d e d because it supplies 
y o u r e a d y - m a d e answers and you n e e d no t 
find t h e m o n y o u r o w n . 
T h e real m a n o f inte l l igence wi l l n o t c l ing to any ideo logy—for 
what? He wi l l n o t ca r ry a load of r e a d y - m a d e answers. He k n o w s that he

to r e spond to it. W h y ca r ry an unnecessary load f rom the past? W h a t i s 
the p o i n t of c a r r y i n g it? 
A n d in fact the m o r e y o u ca r ry f rom the past, t he less y o u wi l l be 
able to r e spond to the present , because the present is n o t a repet i t ion of 
the past, it is always new—always , always new. It is never the old; it may 
somet imes appear like the old, b u t i t is n o t old, there are basic differences. 
Life never repeats itself. It is always fresh, always new, always g row­
ing , always exp lo r ing , always m o v i n g in to n e w adventures . Your 
old 
102 
103 
r e a d y - m a d e answers are n o t g o i n g to help you . In fact they wil l h i n d e r 
you; they wil l n o t al low you to see the n e w si tuat ion. T h e s i tuat ion wil l 
be new, and the answer wi l l be old. 
Tha t ' s w h y you l ook so s tupid in life. 
But to r e m a i n s tupid seems cheaper . To be 
intel l igent needs effort, to be in te l l igent 
means y o u have to grow. A n d g r o w t h i s 
painful. To be in te l l igent means y o u have 
to be con t inuous ly alert a n d aware; y o u 
canno t fall asleep, you c a n n o t live like a 
somnambul i s t . 
A n d to be in te l l igent has a few m o r e 
dangers , too . To be in te l l igent is v e r y diffi­
cult because you have to live w i t h t he s tu­
pid crowds. To live w i t h b l ind p e o p l e and 
have eyes is a dangerous s i tuat ion; they are 
b o u n d to destroy y o u r eyes. T h e y c a n n o t 
tolerate you , y o u are an offense. 
H e n c e Jesus is crucif ied, Socrates is 
po isoned , Al-Hil laj is killed, S a r m a d is b e ­
headed. These w e r e the m o s t in te l l igent 
people that have ever wa lked on the ear th , 
and h o w have w e behaved w i t h t h e m ? 
W h y did a m a n of the in te l l igence of 
Socrates have to be killed? He b e c a m e intolerable . H i s presence b e c a m e 
such an offense. To look in to his eyes m e a n t to l ook in the mi r ror . A n d 
we are so ugly that ra ther t h a n accep t ing the fact that we are ugly, the eas­
ier course is to destroy the m i r r o r and forget all abou t y o u r ugliness, and 
start l iving again in the old d r e a m that you are t he m o s t beautiful p e r s o n 
in the wor ld . 
We destroyed Socrates because he was a mi r ro r . H e n c e p e o p l e have 
decided i t is be t t e r to r e m a i n med ioc re , i t is be t t e r to r ema in u n i n t e l ­

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
Just the o the r day, I was reading a repor t . A few psychologists in E n ­
gland have discovered that by the t ime great poli t icians reach the highest 
posts , the i r in te l l igence is a l ready w i t h e r i n g away. Jus t t h i n k of a m a n 
of e igh ty - four b e c o m i n g a p r i m e minis ter! T h o s e psychologists have 
w a r n e d the w h o l e w o r l d that this i s dangerous . Peop le w h o have g o n e 
beyond the age of sixty, seventy, eighty, they b e c o m e p r i m e minis ters and 
presidents . T h i s is dangerous for the w o r l d because they have so m u c h 
p o w e r and so little in te l l igence left. 
B u t those psychologists are n o t aware of a n o t h e r t h i n g that I w o u l d 
like to tell you . In fact those peop le are chosen to be p r i m e minis ters and 
presidents because they are no l onge r i n ­
tel l igent. Peop le d o n ' t like in te l l igent pe r ­
sons. People like p e o p l e w h o look like 
t h e m , w h o are l ike t h e m ; they feel they 
are n o t strangers. In te l l igent p e o p l e wi l l be 
strangers. 
I can ' t t h i n k of any c o u n t r y that 
cou ld choose Socrates to be the p r ime 
min i s te r—imposs ib le . He is so different, 
his approach to life is so different, his in­
sight i n t o th ings i s so deep. No coun t ry 
cou ld afford it, or no c o u n t r y cou ld be so 
courageous as to m a k e h i m the p r i m e m i n ­
ister because he w o u l d b r i n g chaos. He 
w o u l d start c h a n g i n g each and every thing, 
because each and every t h i n g needs to be 
changed . 
T h i s ro t t en society has to be destroyed 
comple te ly ; on ly t h e n can a n e w society be 
created. R e n o v a t i o n is n o t g o i n g to help-
We have been renovat ing t he same old ru­

A DIFFERENT K I N D OF DISOBEDIENCE 
It is i m p o r t a n t to unde r s t and w h a t I m e a n by disobedience. I t is n o t the

not t o ha te b e i n g to ld w h a t t o do o r t o do jus t the oppos i te o f w h a t y o u

O b e d i e n c e needs no intel l igence. All mach ines are obed ien t ; n o b o d y 
has ever heard of a d i sobed ien t m a c h i n e . O b e d i e n c e is s imple, too . It 
takes f rom y o u the b u r d e n of any responsibility. T h e r e i s no n e e d to r e ­
act, you have simply to do w h a t is b e i n g said. T h e responsibil i ty rests

very free: You canno t be c o n d e m n e d for y o u r act.

selves w o u l d have b e e n in the same s i tuat ion and they w o u l d have said 
exactly the s a m e — t h a t they w e r e n o t responsible. 
I f Stal in h a d b e e n on the s tand in c o u r t , he w o u l d have said tha t i t 
was t h e o r d e r o f t he h i g h c o m m a n d o f t he c o m m u n i s t party. I t was no t 
his responsibi l i ty because i t was n o t his dec i s ion ; he h a d n o t d o n e any­
t h i n g on his o w n . So i f y o u w a n t t o p u n i s h somebody , p u n i s h the

t e a c h — o b e d i e n c e . 
O b e d i e n c e has a simplici ty; d i sobedience needs a little h ighe r order 
of intel l igence. A n y idiot can be o b e d i e n t — i n fact, on ly idiots can be 
obed ien t . T h e p e r s o n of inte l l igence i s b o u n d to ask w h y : " W h y am I 
supposed to do it? Unless I k n o w the reasons and the consequences of it, 
I am n o t g o i n g to be involved in it ." T h e n he i s b e i n g responsible. 
Respons ib i l i ty is n o t a game. It is o n e of the m o s t au then t ic ways of 
l i v ing—dangerous , t o o — b u t i t does n o t m e a n d i sobedience for d isobedi­
ence's sake. T h a t wi l l be again idiot ic . 
T h e r e is a s to ry abou t a Sufi mystic, M u l l a N a s r u d d i n . F r o m the 
v e r y b e g i n n i n g i t was t h o u g h t that he was ups ide d o w n . His 
parents w e r e in t rouble . I f they w o u l d say, " G o to the r igh t , " he 
w o u l d go to the left. Finally his o ld father t h o u g h t that ra ther 
t h a n b o t h e r i n g w i t h h i m , i t w o u l d b e be t te r , i f t hey w a n t e d 
h i m to go to the left, to o rde r h i m to go to the r ight—-he was 
b o u n d to go to the left. 
O n e day they w e r e crossing the river. T h e y w e r e ca r ry ing a 
b ig bag o f sugar s t rapped to t he d o n k e y and the b ag was leaning 
to the r igh t , so there was a dange r that i t m i g h t slip i n to the 
river. I t h a d to r e m a i n ba lanced on the donkey. B u t to tell N a s ­
r u d d i n to m o v e the bag toward the left w o u l d m e a n los ing the 
s u g a r — h e w o u l d m o v e i t toward the r igh t . 
106 
So the father said to N a s r u d d i n , " M y son, y o u r b ag i s s l ip­
p ing ; m o v e i t t oward the r igh t . " A n d N a s r u d d i n m o v e d i t t o ­
ward the r igh t . 
T h e father said, " T h i s is s trange, for the first t ime y o u have 
b e e n obed ien t ! " 
N a s r u d d i n said, " F o r t he first t ime y o u have b e e n c u n n i n g . 
I k n e w y o u w a n t e d this to be m o v e d to the left; I cou ld see w i t h 
my eyes w h e r e i t n e e d e d to be m o v e d . Even in such a subtle way 
you c a n n o t m a k e m e obed i en t . " 
B u t jus t to go against obed ience i s n o t m o v i n g y o u r inte l l igence 
higher. You r e m a i n on the same plane . O b e d i e n t o r d i sobedien t , b u t 
there is no change of intel l igence. 
To m e , d i sobedience is a great revolu t ion . I t does n o t m e a n saying an 
absolute no in every s i tuat ion. I t s imply means dec id ing w h e t h e r to do i t 
or no t , w h e t h e r i t is beneficial to do i t or no t . I t is t ak ing the responsibi l ­
ity on yourself. I t i s n o t a ques t ion of ha t ing the pe r son or ha t ing to be 
told, because in that ha t ing y o u c a n n o t act obed ien t ly or d isobedient ly ; 
you act v e r y unconsciously. You c a n n o t act intelligently. 
W h e n y o u are to ld to do some th ing , you are given an o p p o r t u n i t y to 
respond. Perhaps w h a t is b e i n g asked of you is r i g h t — t h e n do it, and be 
grateful to t he p e r s o n w h o to ld y o u a t the r igh t m o m e n t to do it. P e r ­
haps i t is n o t r i g h t — t h e n m a k e i t clear. B r i n g up y o u r reasons, w h y i t is 
not r ight . T h e n help the pe r son to see that w h a t he is asking is g o i n g in 
a w r o n g d i rec t ion . B u t ha te has no place. If i t is r igh t , do i t lov ing ly If i t 
is no t r ight , t h e n even m o r e love is needed , because you wi l l have to tell 
the person, expla in to the pe r son , that i t is n o t r igh t . 
T h e way of d i sobedience i s n o t stagnant, j u s t go ing against every o r ­
der and feeling anger and ha te and revenge toward the pe r son . T h e way 
of d isobedience is a way of great intel l igence. 
So i t i s n o t u l t imate ly abou t obed ience or d isobedience . R e d u c e d to 
the basic fact, it is s imply a ques t ion of in te l l igence—behave intelligently.

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
108 
Somet imes you will have to o b e y and somet imes you wil l have to say, "I 
am sorry, I c a n n o t do it." B u t there is no ques t ion of hate, there is no 
ques t ion of revenge, anger. I f hate , anger , or revenge arises, that simply 
means you k n o w that w h a t is be ing told to you is r ight , bu t i t goes against 
y o u r ego to obey it; i t hur t s your ego. T h a t h u r t feeling comes up as hate, 
as anger. 
B u t the issue is n o t your ego; the issue is the act ion that you have to 
t a k e — a n d you have to b r i n g forth your total intel l igence to figure i t out . 
If it is r ight , then be obedien t ; if it is w r o n g , be d i sobedien t . But there is 
no conflict , there are no h u r t feelings. 
If you are obey ing , i t is easier; you need no t explain to anybody. But 
i f you are no t obey ing , then you owe an explana t ion . A n d perhaps your 
explana t ion is n o t r ight . T h e n you have to m o v e back, you have to do it. 
A pe r son shou ld live in te l l igent ly—that ' s all. T h e n wha teve r he does 
is his responsibility. 
I t happens that even great intellectuals are n o t l iving intelligently. Mar ­
tin Heidegger , o n e of the greatest intellectuals of this age, was a follower of 
Adol f Hitler. A n d after Ado l f Hide r ' s defeat and the exposure of his basic 
animal i ty brutality, murderousness , violence, even M a r t i n Heidegger shrank 
back and said, "I was simply fol lowing the leader of the nat ion." 
B u t a ph i lo sophe r has no business fo l lowing the leader of the nation. 
In fact, a ph i losopher ' s basic d u t y is to gu ide the leaders of the na t ion , not 
to be g u i d e d by t h e m . Because he is outs ide of active politics, his vision 
shou ld be clearer t h a n theirs. He is s tanding aloof, he can see things that 
peop le w h o are involved in the ac t ion c a n n o t see. 
B u t it is easy to t h r o w responsibil i ty on s o m e b o d y else . . . 
I f Adol f H i t l e r had b e e n v ic to r ious , I am cer ta in M a r t i n Heidegger 
w o u l d have said, " H e i s v ic to r ious because he fol lowed my phi losophy 
A n d certainly H e i d e g g e r was a great in te l lectual c o m p a r e d to Adolf 
Hit ler . Ado l f Hi t l e r was jus t a re tarded pe r son . B u t p o w e r . . . 
We have b e e n b r o u g h t up to fol low the p o w e r f u l — t h e father, the 
mothe r , the teacher, the priest, the G o d . Essentially we have been told that 
w h o e v e r has the p o w e r is r ight : " M i g h t is r ight , and y o u have to foliow 
109 
it." I t is s imple because i t needs no intel l igence. I t is s imple because y o u 
can never be he ld responsible, y o u can never be to ld that w h a t e v e r h a p ­
p e n e d was y o u r responsibility. 
In all t he armies a r o u n d the w o r l d on ly o n e t h i n g i s t aught t h r o u g h 
years of t ra in ing, and that i s obed ience . In Germany , in the S e c o n d W o r l d 
War, there w e r e g o o d p e o p l e — b u t they w e r e heads o f concen t r a t i on 
camps! T h e y were good fathers, good h u s ­
bands, good friends. N o b o d y cou ld have 
conceived o f it, w a t c h i n g t h e m w i t h their 
families, w i t h the i r fr iends, in the club, that 
these peop le w e r e m u r d e r i n g thousands o f 
Jews every day. A n d they w e r e n o t feeling 
guilty at all, because i t was on ly an o rde r 
f rom above. T h a t was their w h o l e t ra in ing, 
that y o u have to fol low the order . I t had 
b e c o m e par t o f their b lood and the i r bones 
and the i r m a r r o w : W h e n the o r d e r comes , 
obed ience is the on ly way. 
Th i s i s h o w m a n k i n d has lived up to 
now, and that 's w h y I say obed ience is o n e 
of the greatest cr imes, because all o t h e r 
crimes are b o r n ou t of it. I t deprives y o u 
of intel l igence, i t deprives y o u of decis ive­
ness, i t deprives y o u of responsibility. I t d e ­
stroys y o u as an individual . It conver ts you 
into a robo t . 
H e n c e I am all for d isobedience . B u t 
disobedience is n o t ju s t against obed ience . 
Disobedience is above o b e d i e n c e and t he so-cal led d isobedience descr ibed 
in the dic t ionar ies . D i sobed i ence is s imply the assertion of y o u r in te l l i ­
gence: "I take t he responsibility, and I wi l l do eve ry th ing that feels r igh t 
to my hear t , to my be ing . I wil l n o t do any th ing that goes against my i n ­
telligence." 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
My w h o l e life, f rom my ch i ldhood to the university, I was c o n ­
d e m n e d for b e i n g d isobedien t . A n d I insisted, "I am n o t d i sobedien t . I 
am simply t r y i n g to figure out , w i t h my o w n intel l igence, w h a t i s r ight , 
w h a t shou ld be d o n e . A n d I take the w h o l e responsibi l i ty for it. I f s o m e ­
t h i n g goes w r o n g , i t was my fault. I d o n ' t w a n t to c o n d e m n s o m e b o d y 
else because he has to ld me to do it." B u t i t was difficult for my parents , 
for my teachers , professors. 
In my school i t was c o m p u l s o r y to w e a r caps, and I en t e r ed the h igh 
school w i t h o u t a cap. Immedia te ly the teacher said, " A r e you aware or 
n o t that the cap is c o m p u l s o r y ? " 
I said, "A t h i n g l ike a cap c a n n o t be compulsory . H o w can i t be 
c o m p u l s o r y to pu t s o m e t h i n g on y o u r head? T h e head i s compulsory , bu t 
n o t the cap. A n d I have c o m e w i t h the head; perhaps y o u have c o m e only 
w i t h the cap." 
He said, "You look a strange type. I t is j u s t w r i t t e n in the school code 
that w i t h o u t a cap, no s tuden t can en te r the school ." 
I said, " T h e n that code has to be changed . I t i s w r i t t e n by h u m a n b e ­
ings, n o t by G o d ; and h u m a n beings c o m m i t mistakes." 
T h e teacher cou ld n o t believe it. He said, " W h a t i s the ma t t e r w i th 
you? W h y can ' t y o u jus t wea r a cap?" 
I said, " T h e t rouble is n o t w i t h the cap; I w a n t to find ou t w h y i t is 
compulsory , its reason, its results. If you are unab le to expla in it, you can 
take me to the pr inc ipa l and we can discuss it ." He h a d to take me to the 
pr incipal . 
In India , Bengalis are the m o s t in te l l igent peop le ; they d o n ' t wear 
caps. A n d Punjabis are the mos t unintel l igent , simple people , and they wear 
turbans . So I said to the pr incipal , " L o o k i n g at the s i tuat ion—Bengal is 
d o n ' t w e a r any caps and they are the mos t in te l l igent p e o p l e in the coun ­
try, and Punjabis wea r n o t on ly a cap bu t a v e r y t ight tu rban , and they are 
the m o s t un in te l l igen t people . I f i t really has s o m e t h i n g to do w i t h your 
intel l igence, I w o u l d ra ther n o t take the risk." 
T h e pr inc ipa l l is tened to me and he said, " T h e b o y i s s t ubborn , but 
w h a t he is saying makes sense. I h a d never t h o u g h t abou t i t—this is true. 
no 
1 
A n d w e can m a k e this code noncompu l so ry . A n y b o d y w h o wants t o 
wear a cap can w e a r o n e ; a n y b o d y w h o does n o t w a n t to, the re i s no 
need—because i t has n o t h i n g to do w i t h l ea rn ing ." 
T h e teacher cou ld n o t believe it. On the w a y back he asked m e , 
" W h a t did you d o ? " 
I said, "I have d o n e n o t h i n g , I s imply expla ined the s i tuat ion. I am 
no t angry, I am perfectly wi l l ing to w e a r a cap. If y o u feel i t helps in te l l i ­
gence, w h y only one? I can wea r t w o caps, three caps, caps u p o n caps, i f 
i t helps my inte l l igence . . . I am n o t angry. B u t y o u have to prove t he 
value of it." 
T h e teacher said to m e , I still r e m e m b e r his words , "You wil l be in 
t rouble y o u r w h o l e life. You wil l n o t fit in anywhere . " 
I said, "Tha t ' s perfectly okay, bu t I d o n ' t w a n t to be an idiot and fit in 
everywhere . I t is good to be 'unfi t ' bu t intel l igent . A n d I have c o m e to the 
school to learn intel l igence, so I can be a misfit intelligently! Please never 
try again to change me f rom an individual in to a cog in the mach ine . " 
A n d f rom the nex t day the caps disappeared; on ly the teacher h a d • 
c o m e w i t h a cap. A n d l o o k i n g at the class and a r o u n d the s c h o o l . . . 
because the n e w ru le h a d c o m e i n t o force that caps w e r e n o t compulsory , 
and all t he o the r teachers , even the pr inc ipa l , had c o m e w i t h o u t caps. He 
looked so silly. I said to h i m , " T h e r e is still t ime. You can take it off and 
put i t in y o u r pocke t . " A n d he did! 
He said, " T h a t ' s r igh t . I f e v e r y b o d y is against the cap . . . I was s im­
ply b e i n g obed i en t to the law." 
So r e m e m b e r , w h e n I talk abou t d i sobedience I d o n ' t m e a n replac ing 
obedience w i t h d isobedience . T h a t wi l l n o t m a k e y o u bet ter . I use t he 
word disobedience on ly to m a k e i t clear to y o u that i t i s up to you , that y o u 
have to be the decisive factor in all y o u r actions in hfe. A n d that gives 
t r emendous s trength, because wha teve r y o u do, you do w i t h a cer ta in ra ­
tional suppo r t to it. 
Just l ive intell igently. 
I f s o m e t h i n g is told to you , decide w h e t h e r i t is r ight or w r o n g . T h e n 
you can avoid all guilt Feelings. O the rwi se , i f you d o n ' t do it, y o u feel 
111 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
112 
guilty; if you do it, again you fee) guilty. If you do it you feel that you are 
be ing subservient , that you are n o t be ing assertive, that y o u are n o t be ing 
yourself. A n d i f you d o n ' t do it, t h e n you start feeling guilty a g a i n — 
because perhaps i t was the r igh t t h ing to do , and y o u are n o t d o i n g it. 
T h e r e is no n e e d for all this clumsiness. Just be simple. I f s o m e t h i n g 
i s asked of you , r e spond intelligently. A n d w h a t e v e r y o u r intel l igence d e ­
cides, do i t this w a y or t h a t — b u t you are responsible. T h e n there is no 
ques t ion of guilt . 
I f y o u are n o t go ing to do it, expla in to the pe r son w h y y o u are no t 
go ing to do it. A n d expla in w i t h o u t any anger, because anger simply 
shows that y o u are weak , that y o u d o n ' t really have an in te l l igent answer. 
A n g e r is always a sign of weakness . Just plainly and simply expla in the 
w h o l e th ing ; perhaps the o the r pe r son m a y find that y o u are r igh t and 
may be grateful to you . Or perhaps the o t h e r p e r s o n m a y have be t t e r rea­
sons t h a n you; t h e n y o u wil l be thankful to the o t h e r pe r son because he 
has raised y o u r consciousness. 
U s e every o p p o r t u n i t y in life for raising y o u r inte l l igence, y o u r con ­
sciousness. 
Ord ina r i l y w h a t we are d o i n g is us ing every o p p o r t u n i t y to create a 
hell for ourselves. O n l y you suffer, and because of y o u r suffering, you 
m a k e o thers suffer. A n d w h e n so m a n y peop le are l iving together , i f they 
all create suffering for each other , i t goes on mul t ip ly ing . Tha t ' s h o w the 
w h o l e w o r l d has b e c o m e a hell . 
I t can be instant ly changed . 
Just the basic t h i n g has to be unde r s tood , that w i t h o u t intelligence 
there is no heaven. 
THE I N T E L L I G E N C E O F I N N O C E N C E 
A chi ld is pu re inte l l igence because a chi ld is yet u n c o n t a m i n a t e d . A child

tabula rasa.

be cut , he has to be g iven cru tches to lean u p o n so he never learns h o w 
to wa lk on his o w n feet, so he remains always in a k ind of dependence . 
First the ch i ldren are d e p e n d e n t on the parents , and the parents enjoy 
i t v e r y m u c h . W h e n e v e r ch i ldren are d e p e n d e n t , parents feel v e r y good. 
T h e i r life starts hav ing s o m e m e a n i n g : T h e y k n o w that they are he lp ing 
some n e w peop le t o g r o w up, some beautiful peop le t o g r o w up . T h e y 
are n o t meaningless . T h e y have a v icar ious en joymen t of b e i n g creative. 
I t is n o t t rue creativity, b u t at least they can say that they are d o i n g s o m e ­

they go on saying they w o u l d like the i r ch i ldren to be i n d e p e n d e n t , tha t

don ' t like the i n d e p e n d e n t chi ld because t he i n d e p e n d e n t chi ld has no

T h a t is o n e of the b ig p rob lems the o lder genera t ion is facing today: 
Chi ld ren in t he m o d e r n age are n o t d e p e n d e n t on t h e m , and because

T h e old genera t ion i s suffering v e r y m u c h . For the first t ime in h u m a n 
history the old gene ra t ion is feeling ut ter ly empty, meaningless , because 
their w h o l e occupa t ion is gone , and their j o y in b r i n g i n g up ch i ld ren is

After w o m e n ' s l iberat ion sooner or later

on you . I t i s v e r y m e a n of y o u to explo i t the child 's helplessness. But

T h i s is the first gene ra t ion w h i c h is t r y ing to escape ou t of t he t rap

T h e y o u n g artist seemed surpr ised a t the ques t ion . "Wel l , "

T h e child said, " T h a t is Pont ius the Pi lo t !" 
B u t n o b o d y watches chi ldren. In fact, eve rybody th inks they are jus t

w h a t they say? W h o listens? 
A chi ld came r u n n i n g h o m e p a n t i n g and b rea th ing hard, 
and to ld his m o t h e r , "Lis ten to w h a t happened ! A t iger chased 
me f rom the school up to the house! S o m e h o w I managed ; I h a d

T h e m o t h e r said, "Listen, I have told y o u mil l ions of t imes

you go again! You found a t iger in the street? W h e r e is the t iger?" 
He said, "You can l ook ou t o f the w i n d o w , he i s s tanding

A small dog! 
T h e m o t h e r l ooked and said, " T h i s i s a tiger? You k n o w

ask for forgiveness!" 
So the chi ld left. After a few m i n u t e s he came back. A n d the

He said, "Yes! I said, ' G o d forgive m e ! I t was total ly w r o n g

B u d d h a h a d s t ruggled for six years to attain e n l i g h t e n m e n t and he had at­
ta ined n o t h i n g . T h e n o n e n igh t he d r o p p e d the w h o l e effort, w e n t t o

T h a t n igh t M a d a m e C u r i e d r o p p e d the idea, the w h o l e pro jec t—she

c o n c e r n e d she closed the w h o l e project . She w e n t to sleep never to be 
b o t h e r e d by that p r o b l e m again. 
A n d in the m o r n i n g w h e n she go t up she was surpr ised. On a piece 
o f paper on he r table, t he so lu t ion was there , w r i t t e n in he r o w n hand­

She looked closely and the h a n d w r i t i n g resembled hers . 
T h e n sudden ly she r e m e m b e r e d a d ream. In the d r e a m she had seen 
that she h a d go t up , g o n e to the table, w r i t t e n s o m e t h i n g . . . Slowly,

this was the solut ion! For three years she h a d b e e n s t ruggl ing hard and

O n c e y o u have d r o p p e d the effort you b e c o m e relaxed, y o u b e c o m e rest­
ful, y o u b e c o m e soft, y o u b e c o m e w i d e , y o u b e c o m e open . I t was there 
inside her, i t surfaced. F i n d i n g the m i n d no l onge r tense, i t surfaced. 
I n n o c e n c e i s there , y o u have s imply fo rgo t t en i t — y o u have b e e n 
made to forget it. Society is c u n n i n g . For centur ies m a n has l ea rned that 
you can survive in this society on ly i f y o u are cunn ing ; the m o r e c u n n i n g 
you are, the m o r e successful y o u wi l l be . Tha t ' s the w h o l e g a m e of p o l i ­

and c o m p e t i t i o n as to w h o can be m o r e c u n n i n g . W h o s o e v e r i s m o r e 
c u n n i n g is g o i n g to succeed, is g o i n g to be 
powerful . 
After centur ies o f cunningness m a n 
has l ea rned o n e th ing : that to r e m a i n i n n o ­
cent is dangerous , y o u wil l n o t be able to 
survive. H e n c e parents t ry to dr ive the i r 
children o u t of the i r i nnocence . Teachers , 
schools, colleges, universities exist for the 
simple w o r k o f m a k i n g y o u m o r e c u n ­
ning, m o r e clever. A l t h o u g h they call i t 
intelligence it is no t intel l igence. 
Intel l igence is n o t against i nnocence , 
m e m b e r . Intel l igence is the f lavor of 
innocence, intel l igence is the fragrance of 
'innocence. C u n n i n g n e s s is against i n n o ­
cence; and cunn ingness , cleverness, are n o t 
s y n o n y m o u s w i t h intel l igence. B u t t o be 
intelligent needs a t r e m e n d o u s j o u r n e y i n ­
ward. No schools can help, no colleges, no universit ies can help. Parents , 
Priests, the society, they are all ext rover ted; they c a n n o t he lp you to go

inward . A n d buddhas are ve ry rare, few and far b e t w e e n . N o t everybody 
is for tuna te e n o u g h to find a b u d d h a . O n l y a b u d d h a can he lp you to be

b e c o m e p r i m a r y school teachers and h i g h school teachers and university 
professors; it is impossible. 
So there is a subst i tute for intel l igence. C u n n i n g n e s s is a substi tute 
for in te l l igence—a ve ry p o o r substi tute, r e m e m b e r . A n d n o t on ly is i t a 
p o o r substi tute, i t is j u s t the oppos i te of it, 
too . T h e inte l l igent pe r son i s n o t cunn ing ; 
cer tainly intel l igent , b u t his intell igence 
keeps his i n n o c e n c e intact . He does no t 
sell i t for m u n d a n e th ings . T h e c u n n i n g 
pe r son is ready to sell his soul for small 
things. 
Judas sold Jesus for o n l y th i r ty silver 
co ins—jus t t h i r ty silver coins . A n d a Jesus 
can be sold. Judas m u s t have t h o u g h t that 
he was b e i n g v e r y in te l l igent , b u t he was 
s imply c u n n i n g . I f y o u d o n ' t l ike the 
w o r d cunning y o u can call h i m clever; that 
is j u s t a g o o d n a m e for the same th ing , for 
t he same ugly t h i n g . 
T h e society prepares y o u t o be cun­
n i n g so that y o u are capable of compet ing 
in this s truggle for existence, the struggle to survive. It is a cu t th roa t com­
pet i t ion , eve rybody is after eve rybody else's throat . Peop le are ready to 
do any th ing to succeed, to be famous , to c l imb the ladder of success, 
n a m e and fame. T h e y are ready to use y o u as s tepping-s tones . Unless you 
are also c u n n i n g y o u wil l be s imply used, manipu la ted . H e n c e the society 
trains every chi ld to be c u n n i n g , and these layers of cunningness are hid­
ing y o u r i nnocence . 
I n n o c e n c e has n o t to be achieved, i t is already there. H e n c e it is not 
a ques t ion of b e c o m i n g , i t is y o u r be ing . I t has on ly to be d iscovered—or

you. You have to say, " T h i s is n o t m i n e ; hence I have no c la im over it. I t 
may be t rue , i t m a y n o t be t rue . W h o knows? O t h e r s say i t i s so; unless i t 
becomes my exper ience I c a n n o t agree or disagree. I wi l l n o t bel ieve or 
disbelieve. I wi l l n o t be a Ca tho l i c or a c o m m u n i s t , I wil l n o t be a H i n d u 
or a M o h a m m e d a n . I wi l l s imply n o t fol low any ideology." Because , 
w h o e v e r you follow, y o u wil l be ga the r ing dust a round yourself. S top fol­
lowing. 
[ . . . ]My w o r k is n o t to teach y o u some th ing , bu t to he lp y o u to d is ­
cover yourself. Just d r o p all k n o w l e d g e . I t hu r t s because y o u have car r ied 
that k n o w l e d g e for so l o n g and y o u have b e e n b r agg ing so m u c h ab o u t 
that k n o w l e d g e — y o u r degrees , M . A . s and Ph .D.s and D.Litt .s, and you 
have b e e n b r agg ing about , all those degrees . A n d sudden ly I am saying to 
you: D r o p all that nonsense . 
Just be as s imple as a child. Just be again a chi ld as y o u w e r e b o r n , as 
God sent you in to this wor ld . In tha t mi r ror l ike state y o u wi l l be able to 
reflect that w h i c h is. I n n o c e n c e is the d o o r to k n o w i n g . K n o w l e d g e is

C o n s t a n t c o n d i t i o n i n g against y o u has created in y o u the idea, " I am

Your head, y o u r m i n d , has b e e n t u r n e d in m a n y ways by m a n y p e o ­

a m a r i g o l d i n to a rose flower, or vice versa. 
All that y o u can do is help the roses to g r o w bigger, m o r e colorful,

the co lo r and the f r ag rance—the m a n u r e that is needed , the r igh t soil, the

F r e u d r e m e m b e r s that w h e n electr ici ty came to V ienna for the f i r s t 
t ime, a fr iend, a villager, came to visit h i m . F r e u d t o o k every care of the 
visitor, t o o k h i m to t he r o o m w h e r e he was g o i n g to sleep, left h i m there, 
and said g o o d n igh t . 
T h e villager was ve ry puzzled by jus t o n e t h i n g — t h e electricity, the 
electric bulb . He k n e w h o w to pu t ou t a lamp, h o w to b low a candle out , 
bu t w h a t to do w i t h this electric bulb? He t r i ed all that he k n e w : standing 
on a chair, he b l ew on i t m a n y times bu t n o t h i n g w o u l d happen to it. He 
examined i t f rom every angle; there was no ho l e in it, there was no th ing . 
H o w cou ld he i m a g i n e that ju s t on the wal l the re was a switch? T h a t 
was impossible for h i m to imagine , he h a d never seen electricity. B u t he 
was also afraid to go and ask F r e u d or s o m e b o d y else, because they w o u l d 
t h i n k he was a f o o l . . . "You can ' t even pu t the l ight o u t — w h a t k i n d of 
m a n are y o u ? " So, feeling embarrassed, he t r i ed to sleep w i t h the l ight on . 
He cou ld n o t sleep. M a n y t imes he s tood up again on the chair, tr ied 
again. T h e w h o l e n igh t i t con t i nued ; sleep w o u l d n ' t c o m e because o f the 
l i g h t — t o o m u c h l ight , such a b r i g h t l ight, he h a d never seen such a 
b r igh t l ight . He h a d k n o w n candles, b u t t he bu lb m u s t have sent the light 
o f a h u n d r e d candles or m o r e i n to the r o o m . In t he m o r n i n g he was dead 
tired. 
F r e u d asked h i m , "You look v e r y t ired. C o u l d n ' t y o u sleep?" 
He said, " N o w the re i s no p o i n t in h i d i n g it, because I am go ing to 
stay three days—this bu lb is g o i n g to kill m e ! E v e n to l ook at i t makes a 
shiver go up my spine. H o w to t u r n i t off?" 
F r e u d said, "You fool! W h y d idn ' t y o u ask m e ? " 
He said, "I was jus t feeling embar rassed—so foolish to ask such a 
s imple t h ing ! " 
F r e u d t o o k h i m to the wall , s h o w e d h i m the swi tch. He t r ied it, 
t u r n e d i t on and off, and laughed . A n d he said, " S u c h a s imple th ing , and 
the w h o l e n igh t I t r i ed and could n o t find it!" 
He could have t r i ed his w h o l e life and m i g h t have never c o n n e c t e d 
the swi tch w i t h the l ight . 
Th i s i s h o w i t i s h a p p e n i n g to you; y o u r m i n d i s con t inuous ly o n . T h e y 
say that the m i n d is such a magni f icen t m e c h a n i s m that i t starts w o r k i n g 
the m o m e n t y o u are b o r n and i t goes on w o r k i n g till y o u stand before an

p e o p l e n e e d to s tand before an aud ience , 
so the m i n d con t inues u n h i n d e r e d and i t 
keeps you ut ter ly tired, exhaus ted , weary, 
bored . A n d i t goes on saying the same 
things again and again. 
W h y are peop le so bored? Life is n o t 
b o r i n g , r e m e m b e r . Life is always a t r e m e n ­
dous mystery, it is always a surprise, it is a l ­
ways new, it is constant ly r e n e w i n g itself. 
N e w leaves are c o m i n g , o ld leaves are 
falling; n e w f lowers are appear ing , o ld 
f lowers d isappear ing. B u t you c a n n o t see 
life because y o u are constant ly b o r e d by 
your o w n m i n d . I t goes on saying th ings i t

tired, for the s imple reason that y o u d o n ' t 
k n o w h o w to swi tch i t off. 
T h e m i n d has n o t t o b e t h r o w n out , 
the m i n d has to be pu t in its place. It is a 
beautiful servant bu t a v e r y ugly master . 
Take the reins in y o u r hands , be t he 
mas te r—and the first act, the first step, is to 
b e c o m e de tached f rom the m i n d . See that i t i s n o t you , create the d i s ­

A n d o n e m o r e miracle y o u wil l be co rn ing across i s that w h e n you 
t u r n the m i n d off, the m i n d b e c o m e s fresher and m o r e inte l l igent . Just 
t h i n k : F r o m t h e day y o u are b o r n the m i n d starts a n d i t goes o n w o r k ­
i n g till y o u d i e — a n d o n e never k n o w s , i t m a y even be w o r k i n g w h e n 
y o u are in the grave, because a few things c o n t i n u e to h a p p e n then . Nails 
go on g r o w i n g even w h e n y o u are in t he grave, ha i r goes on g rowing , so 
some k i n d of m e c h a n i s m still con t inues . E v e n in a dead b o d y the nails 
and hai r go on g rowing , so s o m e t h i n g is still w o r k i n g . M a y b e there is 
some local m e c h a n i s m , n o t the m i n d itself, b u t m a y b e the b o d y has small, 
local m inds to s u p p o r t the b ig m i n d — l i k e agents o f the b ig m i n d . Maybe 
these small agents have n o t yet c o m e to k n o w that the b ig guy i s dead and 
they go on d o i n g the o ld th ing! T h e y k n o w n o t h i n g else so they con t inue 
to repeat the i r o ld j o b . Hai rs go on g rowing , nails go on g r o w i n g — a n d 
jus t small, local minds , m in iminds ! 
T h e m i n d has to be put in its r ight place, and be used only w h e n you 
need it. Just as y o u use your legs w h e n you need t h e m — w h e n you don' t 
need to, you d o n ' t use y o u r legs. If you are sitting in a chair and y o u go on 
m o v i n g y o u r legs up and d o w n , then people will t h ink you are mad . That's 
exactly w h a t is h a p p e n i n g in the mind , and still you th ink you are n o t mad? 
A medi ta t ive awareness comes to k n o w the key. W h e n e v e r i t wants 
to t u r n t he m i n d off i t s imply says, " N o w shut u p , " and that 's it. The 
m i n d s imply keeps qu ie t and great silence prevails inside. A n d the mind 
can also rest in those m o m e n t s ; o the rwise e v e r y t h i n g b e c o m e s tired. 
E v e r y t h i n g tires, eve ry th ing gets t i r e d — e v e n metals get t ired. And 
y o u r m i n d is m a d e of v e r y delicate tissues, so del icate that the re is noth­
ing m o r e delicate in the w h o l e of existence. In y o u r small skull, millions 
of small fibers are func t ion ing . T h e y are so t h i n that y o u r hairs, when 
c o m p a r e d w i t h the nerves that func t ion in y o u r bra in , are v e r y thick, 
h u n d r e d s of thousands of t imes thicker. Such a del icate phenomenon , 
b u t we d o n ' t k n o w h o w to use it. I t needs rest. 
H e n c e a medi ta t ive pe r son b e c o m e s m o r e intel l igent , he becomes 
saner. W h a t e v e r he does there is an ar t in it. W h a t e v e r he touches,is

Simplici ty is to live w i t h o u t ideals. Ideals create complex i ty ; ideals create 
division in y o u and hence complexi ty . T h e m o m e n t y o u are in teres ted in 
becoming s o m e b o d y else y o u b e c o m e c o m p l e x . To be c o n t e n t e d w i t h 
yourself as y o u are is simplicity. T h e future br ings complex i ty ; w h e n you 
are ut ter ly in the present y o u are s imple. 
Simplici ty does n o t m e a n to live a life of poverty. T h a t is u t ter ly s tu -
j id because the p e r s o n w h o imposes a life of pover ty on himsel f i s n o t 
s imple at all. He is a hypocr i t e . T h e n e e d to impose pover ty means , deep 
d o w n , he hankers for the d iametr ica l ly oppos i te ; o the rwise w h y shou ld 
there be any n e e d to i m p o s e it? You impose a cer ta in character u p o n 
yourself because y o u are jus t t he oppos i t e of it. 
T h e a n g r y p e r s o n wan ts t o b e c o m e compass ionate ; t he v io len t p e r -
on wants to b e c o m e nonv io l en t . I f y o u are n o n v i o l e n t y o u wi l l n o t t r y 
t o b e c o m e nonv io len t . For wha t? T h e p e r s o n w h o imposes pove r ty u p o n 
himself is s imply t r y ing to live o u t a life acco rd ing to o thers , n o t a c c o r d -
ng to his o w n i n n e r m o s t core , n o t accord ing to his o w n spontanei ty. 
And to live accord ing to o thers is never to be simple. 
To live acco rd ing to o thers means to live a life of imi ta t ion . I t wi l l be 
a plastic life: You wil l be o n e t h i n g on the surface and jus t t he oppos i t e of 
i t in y o u r depths . A n d only t he dep ths mat ter , the surface never mat te rs . 
You wil l be a saint on t he surface and a s inner deep d o w n . A n d that 's 
what i s go ing to be decisive a b o u t y o u because G o d is on ly in con tac t 
With y o u r dep th , n o t w i t h y o u r surface. 
T h e surface is in con tac t w i t h t he society, the exis tence is in con tac t 
With the dep th . T h e existence on ly k n o w s w h a t y o u are, i t never k n o w s 
What y o u are p r e t end ing . T h e exis tence never k n o w s ab o u t y o u r acts. 
M i n d is a blessing w i t h med i t a t i on , o the rwise i t is a curse. A d d m e d ­
i tat ion to your be ing and the curse disappears, and the curse itself b e ­
comes the blessing; it is a blessing in disguise. 
N T E L L I G E N C E 
130 
You m a y be p r e t e n d i n g to be a great saint, a m a h a t m a , b u t existence wil l 
never k n o w abou t it, because i t never k n o w s abou t any th ing false. A n y ­
th ing false happens o u t of existence. I t k n o w s on ly the real, the real you . 
Simpl ic i ty means to be jus t yourself, w h o s o e v e r y o u are, in t r e m e n ­
dous acceptance, w i t h no goal, w i t h no ideal. All ideals are c rap—scrap all 
o f t h e m . 
I t needs guts to be simple. I t needs guts because you wil l be in c o n ­
stant rebel l ion. I t needs guts because y o u wi l l never be adjusted to the 
so-cal led ro t t en society that exists a round 
you . You wil l constant ly be an outsider. 
B u t you wil l be s imple, and simplici ty has 
beauty. You wil l be ut ter ly in h a r m o n y 
w i t h yourself. T h e r e wi l l be no conflict 
w i t h i n you , the re wi l l be no split w i th in 
you . 
T h e ideal b r ings the split. T h e bigger 
t he ideal, the b igger is g o i n g to be the split. 
T h e ideal means s o m e w h e r e in the future 
o n e day, m a y b e in this life or a n o t h e r life, 
y o u wi l l be a great saint. M e a n w h i l e you 
are a sinner. I t helps y o u to go on hoping; 
i t helps y o u to go on be l iev ing in the sur­
face, that t o m o r r o w eve ry th ing will be 
okay, that t o m o r r o w y o u wi l l be as you 
shou ld be . T h e today can be tolerated. You 
can i gno re it, y o u n e e d n o t n o t e it, you 
need n o t take any no t i ce of it. T h e real t h i n g i s g o i n g to be tomorrow. 
B u t the t o m o r r o w never comes . I t i s always today . . . i t i s always to­
day. 
A n d the pe r son w h o lives in ideals goes on miss ing reality because 
reality is now, here . To be n o w and to be he re is to be s imple: to be like 
trees, he renow, to be like c louds, he renow, to be l ike birds, he renow " to 
be like buddhas , he renow. T h e ideal needs the future . Simplici ty is not an 
131 
ideal. People have m a d e an ideal ou t of simplicity, too ; such is h u m a n 
stupidity. 
Simplici ty can never be an ideal, because no ideal can create s impl ic ­
ity. I t i s the ideal w h i c h po isons y o u and makes y o u c o m p l e x , divides 
you, makes t w o persons in y o u — t h e o n e that y o u are and the o n e that 
you w o u l d like to be. N o w there is g o i n g to be a cons tant war, a civil war. 
A n d w h e n y o u are f ight ing w i t h yourse l f—the v io len t pe r son t r y ing 
to be nonv io l en t , the ugly p e r s o n t r y i n g to be beautiful , and so o n , so 
f o r t h — w h e n y o u are constant ly t ry ing , endeavor ing to be s o m e t h i n g 
that y o u are no t , y o u r ene rgy is dissipated in that conflict, y o u r energy 
goes on leaking. A n d ene rgy is del ight . A n d to have energy is to be alive, 
to be fresh, to be y o u n g . 
Look at people 's faces, h o w dull they appear. Look in to their eyes, their 
eyes have lost all luster and all dep th . Feel their presence and you wil l n o t 
feel any radiance, you will n o t feel any energy s t reaming from t h e m . On 
the con t ra ry y o u will feel as if they are sucking you. R a t h e r then over­
f lowing w i t h energy, they have b e c o m e black holes: T h e y suck you, they 
exploit your energy. Be ing w i t h t h e m you wil l b e c o m e poorer . That ' s w h y 
when you go in to a c rowd and c o m e back you feel tired, weary, y o u feel 
exhausted, you need rest. W h y ? W h y after be ing in a c rowd do you feel as 
if you have lost something? You certainly lose something , because the 
crowd consists of black holes. A n d the m o r e uninte l l igent the c rowd is, the 
more of a m o b it is, the m o r e you will feel exhausted. 
That ' s w h y w h e n y o u are a lone, si t t ing silently, n o t w i t h a n y b o d y — 
in a t r emendous celibate state, j u s t a l o n e — o n e b e c o m e s replenished, re ju ­
venated. Tha t ' s w h y med i t a t i on makes y o u younger , makes y o u livelier. 
You start shar ing s o m e t h i n g w i t h existence. Your energy is f rozen no 
more; it starts flowing. You are in a k i n d of dance, as stars are. A s o n g 
arises in you . 
But in the c rowd you always lose. In med i t a t ion y o u always gain, 
why? W h a t happens in med i t a t ion? In med i t a t i on y o u b e c o m e s imple: 
The future is y o u r c o n c e r n no m o r e . Tha t ' s w h a t med i t a t i on is all about :

c o m m u n i n g , or obse rv ing a bird on the 
w i n g — w h e n e v e r y o u forget all ab o u t past 
and future and the present m o m e n t takes 
possession of you , w h e n you are ut terly 
possessed by this m o m e n t , you wi l l feel r e ­
j uvena t ed . W h y ? T h e split disappears, the 
split created by the ideals. You are o n e in 
that m o m e n t , in tegra ted ; you are all t o ­
gether . 
Simpl ic i ty is n o t an ideal; you cannot 
impose simplici ty on yourself. Tha t ' s w h y 
I never say that p e o p l e like M a h a t m a 
G a n d h i are s imple. T h e y are no t , they can­
n o t be . Simpl ic i ty is the i r ideal, they are 
t r y ing to at tain it. Simpl ic i ty is a goal far 
away in t he future , distant, and they are 
str iving, they are s training, t h e y are in great 
effort. H o w can y o u create simplici ty out 
of effort? Simpl ic i ty s imply means that 
w h i c h is. O u t of effort y o u are t ry ing to 
improve u p o n existence. 
Exis tence is perfect as it is, it needs no 
i m p r o v e m e n t . T h e so-cal led saints go on 
constant ly i m p r o v i n g u p o n themselves— 
drop this, d rop that , repress this, impose that , this is n o t good , that is 
good . . . C o n t i n u o u s effort, and in this ve ry effort they are lost. 
Simpl ic i ty is a state of effortlessness; it is h u m b l e n e s s — n o t t he h u m ­
bleness crea ted against arrogance, n o t h u m b l e n e s s crea ted against the 
ego, n o t humblenes s oppos i te to the p r o u d m i n d . N o , humbleness i s not 
oppos i te to p r ide . H u m b l e n e s s is s imply absence of p r ide . T r y to see the 
132 
po in t . I f y o u r humbleness is against y o u r p r ide , i f y o u have strived to 
d rop y o u r p r ide , y o u r ego, y o u r arrogance, t h e n w h a t y o u have d o n e i s 
only repression. N o w y o u wil l b e c o m e p r o u d abou t y o u r humbleness ; 
n o w y o u wi l l start b ragging , h o w h u m b l e you are. T h i s i s w h a t happens . 
Just see the so-cal led h u m b l e p e o p l e — t h e y are constant ly broadcas t ing 
that they are h u m b l e . 
T h e really h u m b l e peop le wi l l n o t k n o w that they are h u m b l e ; h o w 
can they t h e n b rag abou t it? H o w can the h u m b l e pe r son k n o w that he i s 
-humble? T h e h u m b l e p e r s o n i s a p e r s o n no m o r e . T h e h u m b l e pe r son i s 
in a state of fana: T h e h u m b l e pe r son has dissolved. N o w he is on ly a 
presence. H u m b l e n e s s is a presence, n o t a characterist ic of personality, n o t 
a trait, bu t jus t a presence. O t h e r s wi l l feel it, b u t you wi l l n o t be able to 
feel it yourself. So is the case w i t h simplicity. 
Simplici ty s imply means l iv ing m o m e n t t o m o m e n t spontaneously, 
no t acco rd ing to some phi losophy, n o t accord ing to Ja inism, B u d d h i s m , 
H i n d u i s m , n o t accord ing to any phi losophy. W h e n e v e r y o u live acco rd ­
ing to a ph i losophy y o u have bet rayed yourself, you are an e n e m y to 
yourself. Simplici ty means to be in a deep fr iendship w i t h oneself, to live 
your life w i t h no idea in te r fe r ing . 
I t needs guts, certainly, because y o u wil l be l iving constant ly in in se ­
curity. T h e m a n w h o lives w i t h ideals is secure. He is predic table ; that is 
his security. He k n o w s w h a t he i s g o i n g to do t o m o r r o w . He k n o w s , i f a 
certain s i tuat ion arises, this is the w a y he wil l react to it. He is always ce r ­
tain. T h e m a n w h o i s s imple k n o w s n o t h i n g abou t t o m o r r o w , k n o w s 
no th ing abou t the nex t m o m e n t , because he i s n o t g o i n g to act ou t of his 
past. He wil l r e spond ou t of his present awareness. 
T h e s imple p e r s o n has no "charac ter , " on ly the c o m p l e x pe r son has 
character. G o o d or bad, that i s n o t the po in t . T h e r e are good characters 
and bad characters , b u t b o t h are c o m p l e x . T h e simple p e r s o n i s cha rac ­
terless, he i s ne i the r good n o r bad , b u t he has a beau ty w h i c h no g o o d 
people, no bad peop le can ever have. A n d the good and the bad are n o t 
very different; they are aspects of t he same co in . T h e good p e r s o n is b a d 
behind i t and the bad pe r son is g o o d b e h i n d it.

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
134 
You wil l be surpr ised to k n o w that saints always d r e a m that they are 
c o m m i t t i n g sins. I f you l ook in to the dreams of y o u r so-cal led saints you 
wil l be ve ry m u c h surpr ised. W h a t kinds o f dreams do they go on see­
ing? T h a t is their suppressed m i n d that bubbles up , surfaces i n to their 
dreams. Sinners always d r e a m that they have b e c o m e saints. Sinners have 
the m o s t beaut i ful dreams, because they have b e e n c o m m i t t i n g sins their 
w h o l e life. T h e y are t i red of all those th ings . N o w the den ied par t starts 
speaking to t h e m in their dreams. 
In dreams the den ied par t speaks to you , y o u r unconsc ious speaks to 
you: T h e unconsc ious i s t he d e n i e d par t . R e m e m b e r , i f y o u are good in 
y o u r consc ious , i f you have cult ivated good characterist ics in y o u r c o n ­
scious, y o u wi l l be bad: All that y o u have d e n i e d wi l l b e c o m e y o u r u n ­
conscious , and vice versa. 
T h e s imple pe r son has no conscious , no unconsc ious ; he has no divi­
sion. He is s imply aware. His w h o l e house is full of l ight. His w h o l e be ­
i n g k n o w s on ly o n e th ing : awareness. He has n o t den ied any th ing , hence 
he has n o t created the unconsc ious . T h i s i s s o m e t h i n g to be unders tood . 
S i g m u n d F reud and Car l Gustav J u n g and Alfred Adle r and others 
t h i n k that the conscious and unconsc ious are s o m e t h i n g natural . T h e y are 
no t . T h e unconsc ious is a b y - p r o d u c t of civilization. T h e m o r e a person 
is civilized, t he b igger an unconsc ious he has, because civilization means 
repression. Rep re s s ion means y o u are d e n y i n g a few parts of y o u r being 
f rom c o m i n g in to l ight, y o u are push ing t h e m in to darkness, you are 
t h r o w i n g t h e m in to y o u r basemen t so that y o u never c o m e across them. 
Peop le have t h r o w n their sex, the i r anger, their v iolence, i n to the 
basemen t and they have locked the doors . B u t v io lence , sex, a n d anger 
and th ings like that c a n n o t be locked up . T h e y are like ghosts. T h e y can 
pass t h r o u g h the walls, there is no way to p reven t t h e m . I f y o u succeed in 
p reven t ing t h e m in y o u r dayt ime, they wi l l c o m e in the n i g h t — t h e y will 
h a u n t y o u i n y o u r dreams. 
I t i s because of the unconsc ious that p e o p l e d ream. T h e m o r e civi­
l ized a pe r son , the m o r e he dreams. Go to the aboriginals , the natural 
p e o p l e — a few are still in ex i s t ence—and y o u wil l be again surpr ised to 
135 
k n o w that they d o n ' t d r e a m m u c h , ve ry rarely, once in a whi le . Years pass 
and they never r epor t any d reaming . T h e y simply sleep, w i t h o u t dreams, 
because they have n o t repressed any th ing . T h e y have b e e n l iving n a t u ­
rally. 
T h e s imple pe r son wi l l n o t have the unconsc ious , t he s imple pe r son 
will n o t have dreams, b u t the c o m p l e x pe r son wil l have dreams. 
Tha t ' s w h a t happens to you . If y o u have a fast o n e day, in the n igh t 
you wil l have a feast in y o u r dreams. T h e fast creates the feast in the 
dream. A n d the p e o p l e w h o are feasting in the day m a y start t h i n k i n g o f 
fasting; they always t h i n k abou t it. I t i s on ly r i ch coun t r i e s w h i c h b e c o m e 
interested in fasting. A m e r i c a is in teres ted in fasting, d ie t ing , and all 
things like that. A p o o r c o u n t r y c a n n o t t h i n k of fasting. A p o o r c o u n t r y 
is always fasting, always d ie t ing , always u n d e r n o u r i s h e d . O n l y r i ch peop le 
th ink of fasting. In India, Jainas are the 
richest c o m m u n i t y ; the i r re l ig ion consists 
of fasting. M o h a m m e d a n s are the poorest , 
their re l ig ion consists o f feasting. W h e n 
a p o o r m a n celebrates a rel igious day he 
gives a feast. W h e n a r i ch m a n celebrates 
his rel igious day he fasts. 
You can see t he logic in it. We go on 
compensa t ing . T h e d r e a m i s c o m p e n s a ­
tory, i t compensa tes y o u r w a k i n g life. T h e 
simple m a n wil l n o t d ream, t he s imple 
man wi l l n o t have any unconsc ious . 
T h e s imple m a n wil l b e s imple. H e 
will live m o m e n t t o m o m e n t w i t h no idea 
h o w to live; he wi l l n o t have any p h i l o s o ­
phy of life. He wi l l t rust in his intel l igence. 
W h a t is the n e e d of hav ing a phi losophy? 
W h y should o n e have a phi losophy? So 
that i t can gu ide you . I t means i f y o u are s tupid y o u n e e d a ph i losophy of 
l i fe so that i t can gu ide you . I f y o u are in te l l igent y o u d o n ' t n e e d any 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
136 
phi losophy of life. Inte l l igence is e n o u g h u n t o itself, a l ight u n t o itself. 
A b l ind m a n asks for guidance: " W h e r e is the door? In w h a t d i rec ­
t i on shou ld I move? W h e r e i s the t u r n ? " O n l y the b l ind m a n prepares 
himself before he takes any move . T h e m a n w h o has eyes s imply moves 
because he can see. W h e n the d o o r comes he wi l l k n o w and w h e n the 
t u r n comes he wil l know. He can trust in his eyes. 
A n d that i s the case w i t h the i nne r wor ld , too . Trus t in y o u r intel l i ­
gence, d o n ' t t rust in phi losophies of life; o therwise y o u wi l l r e m a i n stu­
pid. T h e majo r par t o f h u m a n i t y has r e m a i n e d un in te l l igen t because i t 
has t rus ted in phi losophies o f l i fe—Chr is t i an , H i n d u , M o h a m m e d a n . 
Aga in , s o m e t h i n g of ve ry great i m p o r t a n c e to be r e m e m b e r e d : Each 
chi ld is b o r n intel l igent . Inte l l igence is n o t s o m e t h i n g that a few have 
and a few d o n ' t have. Inte l l igence is t he fragrance of life itself. Life has 
i t — i f y o u are alive y o u are intel l igent . B u t t h e n i f y o u never trust in it, i t 
starts slowly, slowly d isappear ing f rom y o u r life. If y o u d o n ' t use y o u r legs 
y o u wi l l lose the capacity to r u n . I f you d o n ' t use y o u r eyes for three 
years and y o u r e m a i n w i t h a bl indfold y o u wil l b e c o m e bl ind. You can 
keep y o u r senses alive on ly i f y o u go on con t inuous ly us ing t h e m . 
Inte l l igence is a natural p h e n o m e n o n ; every chi ld is b o r n intelligent. 
Very few p e o p l e live intelligently, and ve ry few p e o p l e die intelligently. 
N i n e t y - n i n e p o i n t n i n e pe rcen t o f p e o p l e r e m a i n s tupid their whole 
l i f e—and they w e r e n o t un in te l l igen t in t he b e g i n n i n g . So w h a t hap­
pens? T h e y never use the i r intel l igence. W h e n they are small children 
they trust the i r parents and the i r guidance . 
In a be t t e r w o r l d the parents , if they really love the i r chi ldren, will 
teach t h e m to t rust the i r o w n intel l igence. In a be t t e r w o r l d the parents 
wi l l he lp the ch i ld ren to be i n d e p e n d e n t as soon as possible, to be on their 
o w n . 
T h e n , they have to t rust the teachers in the school ; t h e n the profes­
sors in the col lege and in the university. By the t i m e o n e - t h i r d of their 
hfe is gone , they c o m e o u t of the univers i ty u t te r ly stupid. O n e - t h i r d of 
the i r life they have b e e n t augh t to trust s o m e b o d y else: that 's h o w their 
in te l l igence has b e e n p reven ted f rom func t ion ing . 
Look a t small chi ldren, h o w intel l igent they are, h o w alive, h o w 
fresh, h o w t remendous ly ready to learn . A n d look a t o lder people , dull , 
insipid, n o t ready to learn a th ing , c l ing ing to all that they know, c l ing ing 
to the k n o w n , never ready to go on any adventure . 
In a be t t e r w o r l d chi ldren wil l be t h r o w n u p o n themselves as soon as 
possible; the w h o l e effort of the parents should be to m a k e the child use 
his intell igence. A n d the w h o l e effort, i f educa t ion is r i g h t — i f i t is e d u c a ­
t ion and n o t m i s e d u c a t i o n — w i l l be to t h r o w the child again and again 
back to his o w n intel l igence so that he can funct ion, so that he can use it. 
He m a y n o t be so efficient in the b e g i n n i n g , that i s t r u e — t h e teacher may 
have the r igh t answer, and i f the s tuden t has to w o r k ou t his o w n answer 
the answer may n o t be so r i g h t — b u t that i s n o t the p o i n t a t all. T h e a n ­
swer m a y n o t be so r ight , i t may n o t co r re spond to the answers given in 
the books , bu t i t wi l l be intel l igent . A n d that is the real c rux of the mat ter . 
W a t c h chi ldren and you wil l be constant ly surpr ised. B u t we start 
destroying their in te l l igence because we are t oo c o n c e r n e d ab o u t t he 
right a n s w e r — n o t the in te l l igent answer, bu t the r igh t answer. T h a t is a 
w r o n g c o n c e r n . Let the answer be intel l igent , let the answer be a little bi t 
original, let the answer be t he child 's o w n . D o n ' t be b o t h e r e d ab o u t the 
. right, d o n ' t be in such a h u r r y ; the r i g h t wi l l c o m e on its o w n . Let the 
child search for it, let h i m s tumble u p o n i t on his o w n . W h y are we in 
such a h u r r y ? 
We simply d rop the child's g r o w t h o f intel l igence; we supply t he 
right answer. Just th ink : T h e w h o l e process is that the chi ld is never al­
lowed to find the answer himself. We give h i m the answer. W h e n the 
answer is g iven f rom the outs ide, in te l l igence n e e d n o t grow, because i n ­
telligence on ly grows w h e n i t has to find the answer itself. 
B u t we are so obsessed w i t h the idea o f the r ight . No w r o n g shou ld 
ever be c o m m i t t e d . W h y not? A n d the pe r son w h o never c o m m i t s any 
Wrong never grows. G r o w t h needs that you should go astray somet imes , 
that you should start p laying around, fooling a round, that you should find 
o r ig ina l things, even t h o u g h they m a y be w r o n g . You should c o m e to the 
right by y o u r o w n efforts, by y o u r o w n g rowth ; t h e n there i s intel l igence. 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
To be s imple means to be intel l igent . Simplici ty is intel l igence, l iving 
w i t h o u t ideals, w i t h o u t guides, w i t h o u t maps , j u s t l iving m o m e n t t o m o ­
m e n t w i t h o u t any security. 
O u r c o n c e r n w i t h the r igh t and our 
fear of the w r o n g is n o t h i n g bu t o u r fear 
o f the insecure . T h e r igh t makes us secure, 
the w r o n g makes us insecure, bu t life is in ­
security. T h e r e i s no secur i ty anywhere . 
You m a y have a b a n k balance, b u t the bank 
can go b a n k r u p t any day. You m a y have 
the secur i ty of hav ing a h u s b a n d or a wife, 
bu t the wife can leave y o u any m o m e n t , 
she can fall in love; or the h u s b a n d may 
die. 
Life is insecure . Secur i ty is on ly an il­
lusion that we create a r o u n d ourselves, a 
cozy i l lusion. A n d because of this cozy il­
lusion we kill o u r inte l l igence. T h e man 
w h o wants to live s imply wi l l have to live 
in insecurity, wi l l have to accept the fact 
that n o t h i n g is secure and cer ta in , that we 
are on an u n k n o w n jou rney , that nobody 
can be cer ta in w h e r e we are g o i n g and no­
b o d y can be cer ta in f rom w h e r e we are 
c o m i n g . 
In fact, excep t for the s tupid people 
n o b o d y has illusions of certainty. the 
m o r e in te l l igent y o u are, the m o r e unce r t a in y o u are. T h e m o r e intelli­
gen t y o u are, the m o r e hes i tan t—because life is vast. Life is immense, 
immeasurable , mys ter ious . H o w can y o u be certain? 
Liv ing in uncer ta inty , l iv ing in insecurity, is simplicity. Living a life 
w i t h o u t ideals, w i t h o u t character , a life n o t r o o t e d in the past, not moti 
va ted by the future ; a life u t ter ly he re and now. 
138 
A L I G H T U N T O YOURSELF 
139 
T h e last words of G a u t a m a the B u d d h a on the ear th were : Be a light unto 
yourself. Do n o t fol low others , do n o t imitate , because imi ta t ion , fo l low­
ing, creates stupidity. You are b o r n w i t h a t r e m e n d o u s possibility of i n t e l ­
l igence. You are b o r n w i t h a l ight w i t h i n you . Listen to the still, small 
voice w i t h i n , and that wil l gu ide you . N o b o d y else can gu ide you , n o ­
body else can b e c o m e a m o d e l for y o u r life, because y o u are u n i q u e . 
T h e r e has never b e e n anyone w h o was exactly like you , and n o b o d y i s 
ever again g o i n g to be exactly like you . T h i s is y o u r glory, y o u r 
g r a n d e u r — t h a t you are ut ter ly irreplaceable, tha t you are jus t yoursel f 
and n o b o d y else. 
T h e p e r s o n w h o follows o thers b e c o m e s false, he b e c o m e s pseudo , 
he becomes mechan ica l . He can be a great 
saint in the eyes of o thers , b u t deep d o w n , 
he is s imply un in te l l igen t and n o t h i n g else. 
He may have a ve ry respectable character 
but that is on ly on the surface, i t is n o t 
even sk in-deep . Scratch h i m a little a n d 
you wil l be surpr ised that inside he is a t o ­
tally different pe rson , j u s t the oppos i t e of 
his outside. 
By fo l lowing o thers you can cult ivate 
a beautiful character , b u t you c a n n o t have 
a beautiful consciousness , and unless y o u 
have a beautiful consciousness y o u can 
never be free. You can go on c h a n g i n g 
your prisons, y o u can go on c h a n g i n g y o u r 
bondages, y o u r slaveries. You can be a 
Hindu or a M o h a m m e d a n or a Chr i s t i an 
or a Ja ina—tha t i s n o t g o i n g to he lp you . 
To be a Jaina means to fol low Mahav i ra as the m o d e l . N o w , there is n o -
Body w h o is like Mahav i ra or ever can be . Fo l lowing Mahavi ra , y o u wi l l 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
140 
b e c o m e a false entity. You wil l lose all reality, y o u wil l lose all sincerity, 
y o u wi l l be u n t r u e to yourself. You wil l b e c o m e artificial, unna tura l , and 
to be artificial, to be unna tura l , i s the way of t he mediocre , the s tupid, the 
fool. 
B u d d h a defines w i s d o m as l iving in the l ight of y o u r o w n consc ious­
ness, and he defines foolishness as fo l lowing o thers , imi ta t ing o thers , b e ­
c o m i n g a shadow to somebody else. 
T h e real mas te r creates masters , n o t followers. T h e real master 
th rows you back to yourself. H i s w h o l e effort i s to m a k e you i n d e p e n ­
d e n t of h i m , because you have b e e n d e p e n d e n t for centur ies , and i t has 
n o t led y o u anywhere . You still c o n t i n u e to s tumble in the dark n igh t of 
t he soul. 
O n l y y o u r i n n e r l ight can b e c o m e the sunrise. T h e false mas ter per­
suades you to follow h i m , to imi ta te him, 
to be j u s t a c a r b o n copy of h i m . T h e real 
mas ter wil l n o t a l low you to be a carbon 
copy, he wan t s y o u to be the or iginal . He 
loves you! H o w can he m a k e you imita­
tive? He has compass ion for you , he would 
like you to be ut ter ly free—free f rom all 
o u t e r dependenc ies . 
B u t the o rd ina ry h u m a n be ing does 
n o t w a n t to be free. He wants to be de­
p e n d e n t . He wan ts s o m e b o d y else to guide 
h i m . W h y ? Because t h e n he can t h r o w the 
w h o l e responsibil i ty on the shoulders of 
s o m e b o d y else. A n d the m o r e responsibil­
i ty y o u t h r o w away o n t o s o m e b o d y else's 
shoulders , the smaller the possibility of 
y o u r ever b e c o m i n g intel l igent . It is re­
sponsibility, the chal lenge of responsibility, tha t creates w i s d o m . 
O n e has to accept life w i t h all its problems. O n e has to go through life 
unp ro t ec t ed ; o n e has to seek and search one ' s way. Life is an opportunity' 
a chal lenge, to find yourself. B u t the fool does n o t w a n t to go the ha rd

RESPONSES T O Q U E S T I O N S 
Can computers take over the work of human intelligence? 
T h e ques t ion m a y n o t appear ve ry serious, b u t i t i s o n e of the m o s t seri­
ous ques t ions possible. T h e first t h ing to r e m e m b e r is that i t is go ing to 
h a p p e n . T h e r e is no possibility to avoid it; ne i the r is there any need to 
avoid it. Perhaps I am the on ly o n e in the w o r l d w h o is in absolute sup­
p o r t o f mechan ica l brains t ak ing over the w o r k o f h u m a n intelligence. 
T h e reasons are v e r y clear, w h y I am in suppor t of such a strange thing. 
First, w h a t we call the h u m a n m i n d is itself a b i o c o m p u t e r . Just be­
cause you are b o r n w i t h i t does n o t m a k e m u c h difference. A be t t e r com­
pu te r can be i m p l a n t e d in y o u r m i n d — f a r m o r e efficient, far more 
intel l igent , far m o r e comprehens ive . 
T h e r e are always peop le w h o are afraid of every n e w th ing . Every 
n e w t h i n g has b e e n opposed by rel igions, by churches vehemently, be­
cause every n e w t h i n g changes the w h o l e s t ruc ture o f h u m a n life. fo r 
example , the c o m p u t e r can change all the s tupidi ty that m a n has shown 
t h r o u g h the w h o l e of history. I d o n ' t t h i n k that compu te r s wil l like to 
142 
143 
create war, o r c o m p u t e r s wil l explo i t people , o r c o m p u t e r s wil l d i sc r imi ­
na te b e t w e e n black and w h i t e , b e t w e e n m a n and w o m a n . 
M o r e o v e r , y o u are always the master, n o t the c o m p u t e r . You can a l ­
ways change the p r o g r a m of the compu te r . T h e c o m p u t e r i s s imply a 
t r e m e n d o u s in s t rumen t , w h i c h gives you i m m e n s e possibilities that are 
n o t available to y o u biologically. You can do th ings w h i c h m a n has never 
d reamt of. T h e c o m p u t e r can be a t housand t imes m o r e super io r t h a n A l ­
ber t Eins te in . Na tu ra l ly the c o m p u t e r can p r o d u c e a science far m o r e 
fundamenta l , far m o r e real, n o t c h a n g i n g every day because n e w discov­
eries go on h a p p e n i n g and the old discovery b e c o m e s o u t o f date. T h e 
c o m p u t e r can reach the v e r y cen te r o f reality. 
I t can reveal to you w h a t e v e r y o u wan t . I t i s an i n s t r u m e n t in y o u r 
hands . It is n o t a danger . 
A n d because i t wi l l be d o i n g all the intel lectual , m e n t a l w o r k , n o ­
b o d y has seen the possibility that I am tell ing you , that y o u wi l l be left 
ve ry s imply to relax in to med i t a t i on . T h e c o m p u t e r can be p u t t o the 
side. T h e c o m p u t e r can do all the th ink ing ; y o u need n o t go on c o n t i n ­
uously cha t t e r ing unnecessarily. A n d the c o m p u t e r i s n o t Chr i s t i an , i s n o t 
H i n d u , is n o t M o h a m m e d a n . I t is s imply a mechan ica l device created by 
h u m a n consciousness. A n d in r e t u r n i t can he lp h u m a n consciousness to 
reach its highest potent ia l . 
B u t every n e w t h i n g wi l l be opposed , because every n e w t h i n g wil l 
make old th ings ou t of date. O l d factories wi l l close, o ld indust r ies wil l 
close. T h e r e are m a n y invent ions that are never m a r k e t e d in t he w o r l d 
because the peop le w h o s e business wi l l be affected by t h e m purchase 
their patents . A n d the scientist has n o t the m o n e y to m a k e his o w n c o n ­
cept ion in to a reality. 
T h e r e are hund reds o f invent ions that can help h u m a n i t y to be m o r e 
comfortable, to be m o r e joyous , to have be t t e r clothes, be t t e r food. B u t 
they wil l n o t ever c o m e to l ight because there are p e o p l e w h o are g o i n g 
to be r u i n e d i f those n e w things c o m e o n t o the marke t . A n d n e w th ings 
naturally create fear. 
B u t today, m a n y factories are r u n by robots . T h e y never tire, they 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
never retire; they d o n ' t ask for a salary or for a raise; they d o n ' t fo rm 
un ions , they d o n ' t go on strike. T h e y are the nicest peop le you can find. 
A n d they w o r k t w e n t y - f o u r hour s , day in, 
day ou t . T h e i r efficiency is perfect, a h u n ­
dred percen t . B u t it is a dange r because 
p e o p l e are b e c o m i n g u n e m p l o y e d . N o w 
these u n e m p l o y e d p e o p l e are go ing to c re ­
ate t rouble ; they d o n ' t w a n t robots . B u t I 
am all in favor of robots . E v e r y b o d y 
shou ld be u n e m p l o y e d and p a i d — p a i d for 
b e i n g u n e m p l o y e d . R o b o t s are d o i n g the 
w o r k , y o u get t he pay. A n d life becomes 
sheer joy. 
T h e n you can meditate , you can dance, 
you can sing, you can go for wor ld trips. 
T h e p rob lem arises because we cannot 
th ink of the solution. T h e solut ion is sim­
ple. You were paid because you were pro­
duc ing . N o w the robo t i s p roduc ing more, 
m u c h m o r e efficiently, and he is n o t being 
paid. T h e r e is no need for you to remain 
unemployed , hungry , poor . It is such simple 
ar i thmetic: You should be pa id—paid more 
because n o w you have vacated the place for a robo t that produces a hun­
dred times m o r e . So if your salary is doub led there is no loss. 
A n d i f the w h o l e wor ld i s u n e m p l o y e d and has e n o u g h m o n e y to en­
joy, do you th ink anybody is go ing to j o i n the army? People wil l j o i n car­
nivals, c i rcuses . . . All k inds of celebrat ions wil l happen , b u t there is no 
need for war. A n d even if war is an absolute necessity, robots are there, just 
let t h e m fight. N o b o d y is go ing to w i n . B o t h sides are robots; nobody is 
g o i n g to be killed. Eve ry day they c o m e back w i t h a few parts missing; repair t h e m and send t h e m back. E v e n w a r can b e c o m e a great joy—there 
wil l be no ques t ion of defeat or victory. 
144

B u t peop le are afraid because they canno t conceive of a wor ld in 
w h i c h peop le d o n ' t suffer. Your conce rn is that these compu te r s are go ing 
to take the place of intel l igence. T h e y wil l be far super ior in intel l igence, 
bu t r e m e m b e r o n e th ing: T h o s e compu te r s are in y o u r hands . You are n o t 
in their hands , so there is no p rob lem. 
Up to n o w y o u have lived accord ing t o m e m o r y , w h i c h i s an u n n e c ­
essary bu rden , c a r r y i n g i t in y o u r head. Twenty-f ive years of t each ing in 
the schools, colleges, universit ies; Ph.D.s , D .L i t t . s . . . W h a t are y o u d o ­
ing? You are crea t ing a c o m p u t e r , bu t w i t h an old, o u t - o f - d a t e m e t h o d — 
forcing small ch i ldren to m e m o r i z e . T h e r e i s no need . T h e c o m p u t e r can 
do every th ing , i t j u s t has to be g iven in fo rma t ion . 
You can b u y a c o m p u t e r that k n o w s every th ing abou t medica l sci­
ence. You need n o t go to a medica l college; you simply ask the c o m p u t e r 
and immedia te ly the answer is there. Your m e m o r y is n o t so reliable. A n d 
the c o m p u t e r can always be fed w i t h n e w m e m o r y , because n e w discover­
ies are be ing m a d e every day. T h e c o m p u t e r can be p lugged in to the m a i n 
compu te r o f the university, so w i t h o u t y o u r even b o t h e r i n g , every n e w 
discovery c o n c e r n i n g y o u r subject is immedia te ly fed in to y o u r compute r . 
I t waits there, you m a k e an inquiry , and the c o m p u t e r tells you . 
You can have a mul t id imens iona l c o m p u t e r w h i c h has all k inds of 
memory , or a one -d imens iona l c o m p u t e r w h i c h has on ly history, the 
whole h i s to ry o f m a n k i n d . N o w , you c a n n o t have the w h o l e h i s to ry o f 
mankind . Do you k n o w on w h a t date Socrates was m a r r i e d t o Xan th ippe? 
The c o m p u t e r can tell y o u immediately. T h a t unfo r tuna te date . . . I have 
always suspected that Socrates accepted the po i son so easily because of his 
wife, because life was so t o r t u r o u s — d e a t h canno t be worse t h a n that . 
H o w m u c h can y o u m e m o r i z e ? Your m e m o r y has a l imi ta t ion . B u t 
the c o m p u t e r can m e m o r i z e a lmost un l imi t ed a m o u n t s o f th ings . A n d 
there are m a n y m o r e possibilities: O n e c o m p u t e r can j o i n t oge the r w i t h 
another c o m p u t e r and m a n a g e t o figure o u t n e w invent ions , n e w m e d i ­
cines, n e w ways of hea l th , n e w ways of l iving. 
C o m p u t e r s shou ld n o t be taken as mons te r s . T h e y are a great bless­
ing. A n d w h a t man ' s in te l lect has d o n e i s ve ry small. O n c e the c o m p u t e r 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
146 
takes over, so m u c h can be d o n e that there wi l l be no need for anybody 
to be hung ry , no n e e d for anybody to be poor , no n e e d for a n y b o d y to be 
a thief, no n e e d for a n y b o d y to be a j u d g e , because these all b e l o n g to the 
same profess ion—judges and thieves, cr iminals and l awmakers . T h e r e is 
no n e e d for a n y b o d y to be p o o r and no n e e d for anybody to be r ich . 
E v e r y b o d y can be affluent. 
B u t perhaps n o g o v e r n m e n t wil l a l low this t o h a p p e n . N o r ehg ion 
wil l a l low this to h a p p e n , because i t wi l l go against the i r scriptures, i t will 
go against the i r doct r ines . H i n d u s believe that y o u have to suffer because 
in y o u r past life y o u c o m m i t t e d evil acts. N o b o d y k n o w s ab o u t past lives. 
T h e y c a n n o t accept an inven t ion w h i c h can r e m o v e misery, poverty, sick­
ness, because t h e n w h a t wi l l h a p p e n to the t h e o r y o f re incarna t ion , and 
rewards and pun i shmen t s o f g o o d and b a d deeds? T h e w h o l e doc t r ine o f 
H i n d u i s m wil l be s imply meaningless . 
A y o u n g m a n came f rom the universi ty w i t h t he degree o f M . D . 
H i s old father was wa i t ing for h i m , because he was tired, w o r k ­
i n g his w h o l e life. T h r e e of his sons w e r e s tudy ing a t medica l 
co l l ege—if at least o n e comes back, he can take his place and 
suppor t the o t h e r two . A n d the y o u n g m a n immedia te ly said, 
"You n e e d n o t be w o r r i e d . You rest and relax, I wil l take care." 
A n d the th i rd day he approached his father and said, "Dad , 
the w o m a n y o u have b e e n t rea t ing for th i r ty years I have cured ." 
T h e father said, "You idiot! T h a t i s the w o m a n w h o has

b ro the r s . I was keep ing he r in this cond i t i on . She was so r i ch she 
cou ld afford to be sick. She was n o t poor . " 
To be r i ch and to be sick is v e r y dangerous . To be p o o r and to be 
sick is n o t v e r y dangerous . You wil l be cu red ve ry soon, because you can­
n o t pay m u c h . On the contrary, y o u m a y ask t he doctor , " W h a t about the 
med ic ine , w h a t abou t the food y o u have prescr ibed? I d o n ' t have any

h i m , you d o n ' t get that money . 
Bu t i f c o m p u t e r s can manage , then 
many professions will be affected. A n d 
these will be the professions that will p r e ­
vent it; they will m a k e a t housand and o n e

compu te r s are dangerous because they will 
take all intel l igence away from you . 
W h a t are you d o i n g w i t h y o u r intel l i ­

not be miserable. W h a t are you d o i n g w i t h

C o m p u t e r s can give y o u a c o m p l e t e hol iday for y o u r w h o l e life. You 
can relax. You wil l have to l ea rn h o w to relax, because y o u have all b e ­

W h a t m a n has d r e a m t o f f i nd ing in paradise, life can really b e c o m e

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
148 
no paradise in exis tence . I t has to c o m e o u t o f m a n ' s awareness , c o n ­

T h e c o m p u t e r i s also par t o f man ' s creativity. T h e r e i s no n e e d to b e ­

cult because t he m i n d is inside y o u r head a n d y o u r consciousness is so

E v e r y b o d y has his o w n c o m p u t e r in his p o c k e t and k n o w s that i t i s

y o u can be for t he first t ime w h a t the b u d d h a s have b e e n ta lking a b o u t —

A c o m p u t e r c a n n o t be aware. A c o m p u t e r can be intel lectual , a c o m ­

T h e c o m p u t e r can be o n e o f the greatest p h e n o m e n a that has ever

Why does humanity seem so willing to walk the path toward global 
suicide? 
T h e reason is clear. Peop le have realized that their life has no m e a n i n g , 
that excep t for misery, n o t h i n g happens ; except for anxiety, anguish , life 
has n o t h i n g to offer. 
Individuals have always c o m m i t t e d suicide. A n d y o u wi l l be sur­
prised: T h e p e o p l e w h o have c o m m i t t e d suicide have always b e e n a l i tde 
m o r e in te l l igent t h a n the n o r m a l people . Psychologists c o m m i t suicide 
twice as m u c h as any o t h e r profession. Painters , poets , ph i losophers e i ther 
go m a d o r c o m m i t suicide. Idiots have never b e e n k n o w n to c o m m i t sui-
i l e i d e , n o r d o they g o mad . 
T h e idiots have never c o m m i t t e d suicide because they c a n n o t even 
th ink abou t m e a n i n g , significance, purpose . T h e y d o n ' t t h i n k a t all; t hey 
simply live, they vegetate . T h e h i g h e r the intel l igence, t he m o r e d a n g e r ­
ous, because i t makes y o u aware that the life that y o u are l iv ing is j u s t h o l ­
low, ut ter ly empty. T h e r e i s n o t h i n g to h o l d on to . You k n o w t o m o r r o w 
will be a repe t i t ion of today, so w h a t is the p o i n t of con t inu ing? 
Individuals have c o m m i t t e d suicide because on ly individuals have 
come to a cer ta in stage of intel l igence, of unde r s t and ing w h e t h e r life has 
any m e a n i n g or no t . N o w , for the first t ime, mil l ions of p e o p l e a r o u n d 
the ear th have reached that m a t u r i t y w h e r e they feel life is meaningless . 
That 's w h y h u m a n i t y is m o v i n g toward a global suicide. T h e r e seems to 
he no reason to c o n t i n u e — f o r wha t ? You have lived y o u r life, and y o u 
have found n o t h i n g . N o w y o u r ch i ldren wil l live and they wi l l f ind 
149 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
150 
n o t h i n g : gene ra t ion after genera t ion , on ly empt iness in y o u r h a n d s — n o 
fulfillment, n o c o n t e n t m e n t . 
Bu t to me , this gives m a n a t r e m e n ­
dous oppor tun i ty . O n l y v e r y h ighly in te l ­
l igent p e o p l e have c o m m i t t e d suicide or 
have b e c o m e m a d , because they co u l d no t 
live w i t h this insane wor ld . T h e y cou ld no t 
adapt themselves to all k inds of insanities 
that are g o i n g a round . T h e y felt themselves 
fallen apa r t—tha t was the i r madness . But 
on ly the same k ind of peop le have also be ­
c o m e en l igh tened . 
So these are the three possibilities for 
intel l igence. E i t h e r t he in te l l igent person 
goes m a d because he c a n n o t figure out 
w h a t is h a p p e n i n g , w h y i t is happening, 
w h y he i s supposed to do this or that. Or, 
seeing the s i tuat ion, that i t is d r iv ing him 
mad , he c o m m i t s suicide, he puts an end to 
life. T h i s has b e e n mos t ly the case in the 
West. 
In the East the same k ind of people 
have t r ied some th ing e l se—not madness, bu t medi ta t ion . T h e West is poor 
in that way. I t does n o t k n o w the richness of medi ta t ion . I t does no t know 
that medi ta t ion can t ransform y o u r w h o l e vision of life; i t can give you 
t r emendous meaningfulness, beauty, benedic t ion . T h e n life is something sa­
cred, you canno t destroy it. 
You m u s t l ook at it, that in the East the rate of suicide is very low 
c o m p a r e d to the West , t he rate of p e o p l e g o i n g m a d i s v e r y low com­
pared to the West . A n d o n e t h i n g m o r e : In t he East, t he peop le who go 
m a d are really n o t v e r y in te l l igent people . T h e y are psychologically sick' 
I t is n o t the i r in te l l igence that has led t h e m to madness , i t is something 
miss ing in the i r m i n d s . Perhaps their food is n o t r igh t , i t is n o t enough to 
help their m i n d b e c o m e ma tu re . T h e i r vegetar ian ism i s lacking cer ta in 
prote ins w h i c h are absolutely n e e d e d for intel l igence to grow. 
So the madness in the West and in the East i s totally different. T h e 
madness in the East is s o m e t h i n g psychological : T h e y are miss ing cer ta in 
things, their g r o w t h is re tarded, the i r minds c a n n o t g r o w the way they 
w o u l d have g r o w n . 
T h e peop le w h o c o m m i t suicide in the East are also different f rom 
the p e o p l e w h o c o m m i t suicide in the West. In the East p e o p l e c o m m i t 
suicide because of hunge r , because of starvation, because they c a n n o t 
manage to l i v e — a n d life b e c o m e s such a 
tor ture . So there is a qualitative difference. 
B u t the intel l igent peop le in the East 
have always t u rned toward medi ta t ion . 
W h e n e v e r they have felt that life has no 
meaning, they have t r ied to find the m e a n ­
ing w i t h i n themselves; that 's the way of 
meditat ion. T h e y have t r ied to find o u t the 
very source of life, love, and they have 
found it. A n y b o d y w h o looks i nward is 
bound to find it. It is n o t far away, it is jus t 
within you. You are ca r ry ing it all the t ime! 
T h e W e s t e r n intel l igentsia i s l o o k i n g 
for m e a n i n g outside, and there is no m e a n ­
ing outside. T h e y are l o o k i n g for blissful-
ness outside. R e m e m b e r , the beau ty is in 
the eyes of the on looke r ; it is n o t there 
outside. A n d the same is t r u e abou t m e a n 
ingfulness, blissfulness, bened ic t i on . It is 
Within y o u r vision, i t is w i t h i n you . W h e n 
you have it, you can project i t over the 
hole of existence. B u t first y o u have to find i t w i t h i n yourself. 
I f J ean -Pau l Sartre, Marce l Prous t , M a r t i n He idegger , L u d w i g 
Wittgenstein, Be r t r and Russel l , peop le l ike these, h a d b e e n b o r n in the 
151 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
152 
East, they w o u l d all have b e c o m e en l igh tened beings . B u t in the West , 
t hey all b e c a m e t r emendous ly b u r d e n e d w i t h anguish, anxiety. T h e y 
found that i t is all accidental and meaningless , that there is no pu rpose in 
life, and j o y is ju s t a d ream, jus t a h o p e ; it does n o t exist in reality. 
T h e West needs med i t a t ion . T h e East needs med ic ine ; i t i s sick in the 
body. T h e West i s sick in the soul. O n c e we unde r s t and the p rob lem 
clearly . . . N o w it is n o t the East w h i c h is a dange r to the wor ld ; at the 
m o s t they can starve and die as they are dy ing in E th iop ia . B u t i t is n o t a 
danger to the wor ld . In fact, in a w a y the s tarving East is he lp ing the 
w o r l d by dy ing . I t is r educ ing the popu l a t i on of the wor ld . I t is mak ing 
eve rybody r icher , w i t h o u t y o u r k n o w i n g it. O n e thousand Ethiopians 
dy ing every d a y — y o u may n o t see that s o m e h o w they are he lp ing your 
comfor t , b u t they are, because i f the popu l a t i on of the w o r l d is reduced, 
peop le can live m o r e comfortably, m o r e easily, m o r e joyously. 
T h e p r o b l e m is n o t c o m i n g f rom the East; the p r o b l e m is coming 
f rom the West . T h e p r o b l e m is that the W e s t e r n intell igentsia is fed up 
w i t h life, so the re is no real resistance f rom the intell igentsia against nu­
clear w e a p o n s , against a th i rd wor ld war. In fact, i t seems deep d o w n the 
Wes t e rn m i n d is s o m e h o w h o p i n g that i t happens soon, because life is 
meaningless . 
R a t h e r t h a n tak ing the risk of c o m m i t t i n g suicide yourself, i f politi­
cians can m a n a g e to destroy the w h o l e wor ld , tha t wi l l be far easier. You 
wil l n o t be in the d i l e m m a of to be or n o t to be . You wil l n o t have to 
t h ink w h e t h e r to destroy yourself o r no t , to w o n d e r i f perhaps tomorrow 
things m a y be different. 
It is an individual responsibil i ty to c o m m i t suicide, b u t a global war, 
a nuc lear w a r — a l l y o u r personal responsibil i ty disappears. It is no t your 
do ing , i t is j u s t h a p p e n i n g . 
W h y is the W e s t e r n intell igentsia n o t really f ight ing against nuclear 
weapons? W h y are the sc ien t i s t s—who are par t o f t he intelligentsia s t i l l 
serving government s? T h e simplest w a y w o u l d be for all the scientists 
w h o are crea t ing nuc lear w e a p o n s to resign. T h e y shou ld say, "Enough is 
e n o u g h . We c a n n o t create these w e a p o n s w h i c h are go ing to destroy l i f e 
on the ear th . " A n d the poe t s , the phi losophers , the p a i n t e r s — t h e y d o n ' t 
seem to protest . T h e y have j u s t b e c o m e spectators. T h e r e i s a reason b e ­
h i n d it. W e s t e r n h u m a n i t y has b e e n t u r n e d by and by in to spec ta to r s— 
abou t every th ing . 
You d o n ' t play football, b u t t w e n t y - t w o persons w h o are profess ion­
als, this is the i r business, to play football . A n d mil l ions of peop le are jus t 
spectators, and they are so exc i ted . . . j u m p i n g in their seats, sc reaming, 
shout ing . I f they are n o t in the s tad ium, t h e n they are si t t ing in the i r 
homes before the television screen and they are d o i n g the same gestures 
there. S o m e b o d y else is playing; y o u are jus t a spectator. 
T h e average A m e r i c a n is l o o k i n g at the television five to six h o u r s a 
day: six h o u r s of ju s t b e i n g a spectator, n o t a par t ic ipant . T h e n there are 
movies w h e r e you are spectators, and there are b o x i n g matches w h e r e 
you are spectators . I t seems y o u have lost con tac t w i t h life. You s imply 
see others l iving; y o u r life is j u s t to wa tch . S o m e b o d y is in a c o m p e t i t i o n 
for a w o r l d c h a m p i o n s h i p in chess, and you are wa tch ing . C a n ' t y o u play 
chess yourself? C a n ' t y o u play football yourself? 
It is n o t far away, it is already h a p p e n i n g . . . y o u wi l l n o t be m a k i n g 
love to y o u r wife, to y o u r g i r l f r i end—somebody else wi l l be d o i n g i t and 
you wil l be wa tch ing , j u m p i n g : "Aha! Great! Go o n ! " 
You have left the w h o l e of life for o thers to live on y o u r behalf, and 
then y o u ask w h e r e t he m e a n i n g has g o n e , w h y y o u d o n ' t feel alive, 
why the re i s n o t s o m e significance in y o u r life. Specta tors c a n n o t have 
s ignif icance—only par t ic ipants , total ly involved, intensely involved in 
every act ion. 
So perhaps the W e s t e r n intel l igentsia i s j u s t in the s i tuat ion of spec­
tators, w a t c h i n g w h e n i t i s a n n o u n c e d on the television that the th i rd 
World w a r has b e g u n . Lis ten ing to t he radio, r ead ing the newspaper . . . 
But are you g o i n g to do s o m e t h i n g or no t? 
It is doing tha t keeps y o u r ju ices r u n n i n g . If you are s imply wa tch ing , 
your o w n ju ices d r y up . You b e c o m e jus t a skeleton. 
I am surpr ised that the Wes t has a great, educated , intel l igent majori ty in the wor ld , bu t they do n o t h i n g , they d o n ' t take any act ion. A I D S is 
153 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
sp read ing—you are s imply wa tch ing . Your g o v e r n m e n t s are pi l ing up 
nuclear weapons , p repa r ing y o u r funeral p y r e — a n d you are jus t watching. 
You have to be taken ou t of this h y p n o t i c state of b e i n g a m e r e spec­
tator. T h e r e are n o t m a n y p e o p l e w h o are m a k i n g nuclear weapons . 
T h e r e are on ly a few scientists w h o k n o w how. C a n ' t they s imply say, 
" N o , we are n o t g o i n g t o be servants o f dea th"? 
A n d all the poe t s and all the painters 
and all the great N o b e l pr izewinners , 
novelists, actors, musicians , dancers—what 
are they doing? T h e r e shou ld be a great 
pro tes t—al l the nuc lear w e a p o n s should be 
d r o w n e d in the Pacific. W h o e v e r n a m e d i t 
the "Pacif ic" mus t have h a d a great insight 
i n to the future . N o w let that n a m e be­
c o m e a reality. 
B u t the t rouble is, unless y o u start feel­
ing some m e a n i n g in life, some j o y arising 
in you , some fragrance s u r r o u n d i n g you, 
y o u c a n n o t fight for life. A n d life needs, for 
the first t ime in the h i s to ry of m a n , to be 
fought for. 
M e d i t a t i o n wi l l create the necessary 
a tmosphere . I t wi l l b r i n g y o u back to ac­

then , naturally, you will see that it is time 
for s o m e t h i n g to be done . T h i s beautiful ea r th shou ld n o t die. 
Th i s is a u n i q u e planet , v e r y small. In this i m m e n s e universe, which 
k n o w s no limits, this small ea r th is u n i q u e — u n i q u e because birds sing 
here , flowers b lossom here , life has reached a n e w level: consciousness. 
A n d in a few p e o p l e consciousness has t o u c h e d its o m e g a po in t : enlight­
e n m e n t . 
C o m p a r e d to this ear th , the w h o l e universe is dead. It is big, vast, 
b u t even a s ingle rose flower is far m o r e valuable t h a n the b igges t stars-
154 
A n y b o d y w h o wants to destroy this ear th wants to destroy s o m e t h i n g 
u n i q u e that is evolving. A n d i t has t aken mi l lenn ia to c o m e to this state 
of consciousness. E v e n if on ly a few peop le have a t ta ined to u l t imate 
bliss and ecstasy, that is e n o u g h to m a k e this ear th the greatest treasure. 
T h e r e are mil l ions of solar systems, b u t no solar system can c la im a

some th ing immense ly great, i t has m a d e the w h o l e universe r i ch . I t c a n ­
no t be destroyed. 
War should be s t o p p e d — a n d i t i s w i t h i n o u r hands to do so. D o n ' t 
be on ly a spectator. R a t h e r t h a n jus t r e m a i n i n g in y o u r misery, start f ind­
ing sources of life and mys t e ry w i t h i n yourself. T h a t is the on ly possibi l­
ity for saving the w h o l e wor ld . 
I cannot cope with many social situations I find myself in. Do I need the 
help of a psychiatrist? 
Your m i n d is perfectly okay. In fact, this s i tuat ion happens to eve rybody 
w h o has a cer ta in inte l l igence. I t is n o t that y o u are l ack ing some th ing , i t 
i s that you have m o r e t h a n average intel l igence. T h i s p r o b l e m is n o t b e ­
cause of lack, this p r o b l e m is because of s o m e t h i n g plus: You have m o r e 
intel l igence t h a n average. 
W h e n the m i n d is a little m o r e in te l l igent i t is never satisfied because 
i t can always i m a g i n e be t t e r si tuations; that is t he p rob l em. If y o u have 
one thousand rupees and y o u are s tupid y o u can he satisfied! B u t h o w can 
an in te l l igent m a n be satisfied? He th inks o f t w o thousand , three t h o u ­
sand, f ive thousand ; wha t soeve r he has he can always imag ine m o r e . 
You have a beaut i ful w o m a n ; a in te l l igent pe r son starts t h i n k i n g of 
m o r e beautiful w o m e n , he goes on fantasizing. An id io t i s satisfied b e ­
cause he c a n n o t imag ine . . . he c a n n o t even i m a g i n e a be t t e r s i tuat ion, 
so w h y be unsatisfied, h o w to be unsatisfied? 
So psychiatrists c a n n o t he lp because you d o n ' t have any th ing w r o n g ! 
T h e y c a n n o t p u t any th ing r igh t because there i s n o t h i n g w r o n g . You 
155 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
156 
have m o r e t h a n average intel l igence. N o w , y o u wi l l have to apply this in ­
tel l igence to y o u r p rob lems m o r e deeply. R a t h e r than asking somebody 
else's help, y o u wi l l have to apply y o u r o w n inte l l igence to y o u r p r o b ­
lems. 
For example , w h e n you are unsatisfied w i t h a cer ta in th ing , b e c o m e 
v e r y aware of w h y y o u are unsatisf ied—see the w h o l e dissatisfaction, go 
i n t o i t deeply. Layer by layer, o p e n all t he doors , examine every situation, 
every m o o d . Awareness i s g o i n g to help y o u because y o u have intel l i­
gence and inte l l igence can be conve r t ed in to awareness. 
S e r m o n s w o n ' t h e l p — s o m e b o d y saying, "Just be satisfied," i s n o t g o ­
ing to help you; that you c a n n o t do . You wil l have to go in to deep analy­
sis of y o u r o w n m o o d s . So w h e n e v e r y o u are feeling unsatisfied, n o t h i n g 
is w r o n g — t h e first t h i n g to be u n d e r s t o o d is that n o t h i n g is w r o n g ! You 
shou ld feel for tunate because y o u cou ld have b e e n s tup id—stup id people 
never have this p rob lem, idiots d o n ' t have any p rob lems . A p r o b l e m is a 
good ind ica t ion . 
A n d w h e n y o u t h i n k abou t life, w h e n y o u b e c o m e aware of life . . . 
life is meaningless , so h o w to be satisfied w i t h it? If you go deeply into 
this, by and by y o u wi l l start feehng that in life there is no possibility of 
any satisfaction. T h e n you have s tumbled u p o n the first basic t r u th—tha t 
life i s meaningless . T h e n o n e can t u r n w i t h i n ; t h e n there i s no need to go 
outs ide, because outs ide there is no m e a n i n g possible. T h e r e is on ly anx­
iety and anguish . 
A n d peop le l ike you c o m m i t suicide. W h e n l i fe b e c o m e s t o o heavy 
and e v e r y t h i n g is unsatisfactory and n o t h i n g br ings happiness , o n e starts 
feeling, " W h a t i s t he p o i n t o f g o i n g on living? T h e n destroy yourself!" 
Peop le o f y o u r type e i ther c o m m i t suicide or they b e c o m e great seekers; 
b o t h are possibilities. I f they d o n ' t destroy themselves they start turn ing 
i n w a r d and they create a n e w life. T h e life that is available t h r o u g h the 
senses is meaningless , b u t that is n o t the on ly life. T h e r e is o n e m o r e life, 
far greater, far m o r e g lor ious , and that is the life of an i n w a r d conscious­
ness. 
So n o w y o u are b e c o m i n g a seeker, y o u are at the d o o r of it, so please 
d o n ' t t h ink that y o u are ill. I f y o u th ink in those t e rms y o u wil l start feel­
i n g ill, you wil l hypno t i z e yourself in to bel ieving that y o u are ill. You are 
n o t ill at all. C o m p l e t e l y d r o p that idea! N e v e r go to a psychiatrist , b e ­
cause i f you go they wi l l find s o m e t h i n g w r o n g w i t h y o u even i f i t i s n o t 
there. T h e y have to find i t — t h e y also have to live, so w h e n s o m e b o d y 
comes they have to find s o m e t h i n g w r o n g and treat h i m . 
I can see deeply i n to y o u that there is n o t h i n g w r o n g . I t is j u s t that 
you are un fo r tuna te in o n e w a y that y o u have m o r e t h a n average in te l l i ­
gence. So y o u can m a k e a mi se ry ou t of i t or y o u can m a k e a blessing ou t 
o f i t—i t depends on you . 
I feel fed up with myself, feel no connection between my inner world and 
the outer one. I used to have many interests but no longer feel in touch 
with them. 
This is h o w any inte l l igent pe r son will feel. B o r e d o m is the pr ice o n e 
pays for intel l igence. I t shou ld n o t be t aken negatively. T h i s is good , b e ­
cause in u n d e r s t a n d i n g this the re is a possibility to t ranscend. If y o u are 
no t fed up , y o u can never t ranscend yourself. Blessed are those w h o are 
really fed up because they can t ranscend. Of course, to t ranscend is a dif­
ficult and a rduous j o b ; it is n o t easy. It is like c l imb ing Everes t—i t is a 
difficult t h i n g — b u t once y o u are really fed up , t h e n even in the difficulty 
there is a chal lenge. 
So the first t h i n g is, d o n ' t be w o r r i e d abou t i t—i t is g o o d that i t is so. 
A n d d o n ' t take i t negat ive ly—it is par t of intel l igence, a n d y o u are an i n ­
tell igent pe rson , so natural ly y o u are b o u n d to c o m e to this state of b o r e ­
d o m . 
T h e second t h i n g . . . 
W h e n y o u start b e i n g fed up, natural ly y o u wi l l start w o n d e r i n g h o w 
to go inward because y o u are fed up w i t h the outs ide, y o u k n o w all that 
is outside. I was j u s t r ead ing today a very anc ien t s to ry of a k i n g — h i s 
name was Bhar t i rha r i . 
157 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
158 
W h e n he b e c a m e the k ing , he called all his minis ters and to ld them, 
" T h i s wi l l be my rule a n d this i s my o r d e r to you : I w a n t to exper ience 
eve ry th ing once bu t never twice . So the same food has n o t to be served 
to me again, t he same w o m a n has n o t t o be b r o u g h t t o me again—• 
eve ry th ing jus t o n c e ! " 
By the e n d of the year they came and said, " N o m o r e i s possible. All 
tha t we cou ld do , we have done . N o w we are d r iv ing ourselves c razy— 
w e c a n n o t f i n d n e w th ings!" 
T h e k i n g said, " I t i s o k a y — I wil l r e n o u n c e i t all!" A n d he b e c a m e a 
sannyasin. He said, " N o w finished! I have tasted eve ry th ing once , w h a t is 
the p o i n t of tast ing i t twice? I am n o t so stupid! O n c e is o k a y — n o w I 
k n o w the taste of i t — b u t w h a t i s the p o i n t o f repea t ing t he taste of i t?" 
I loved the s tory . . . i t i s t r emendous ly beaut i ful . 
Th i s i s h o w any inte l l igent pe r son wi l l be! So there i s n o t h i n g to be w o r ­
r ied a b o u t — d o n ' t b e c o m e serious abou t it. I t is good , i t is perfectly okay 
to feel fed up . Peop le w h o d o n ' t feel fed up w i t h themselves are in a 
w r o n g si tuat ion; they are in danger , they 
wil l never change . T h e r e is no n e e d for 
t h e m to change . T h e y wil l go on revolving 
in the w h e e l — t h e y are mechan ica l people. 
Th i s is t he first ray of consciousness in 
y o u — t h a t y o u feel fed up . 
W h o is this o n e w h o feels fed up? 
Th i s awareness is y o u — t h i s is the first ray 
of consciousness. So the way that you have 
lived up to n o w and all the things that you 
have d o n e up to n o w are meaningless . 
N o w , the second t h i n g . . . T h e p rob­
lem arises that n o w the outs ide is almost 
f i n i s h e d — h o w to go inward? I f y o u start s t ruggl ing to go in, i t wi l l not 
be in . I f y o u t r y and m a k e an effort to go in, i t wi l l n o t be in , because 
whatsoever we do w i t h effort leads outside, takes us outs ide; any th ing 
d o n e by effort moves ou tward . 
To go in means to relax, to let g o — t h e r e i s no o the r way. W h e n you 
relax y o u go in , w h e n y o u start d o i n g s o m e t h i n g y o u go ou t . D o i n g 
means go ing out , n o n d o i n g means g o i n g in . Tha t ' s w h y i t i s a rduous . I f 
there w e r e s o m e t h i n g to do I w o u l d have to ld you , " D o this a n d you will 
be in ." I t is n o t a ques t ion of do ing . You wil l have to l ea rn pat ience, you 
will have to learn infini te pat ience . 
A n d jus t start si t t ing. W h e n e v e r you have t ime jus t sit silently w i t h 
closed eyes n o t d o i n g any th ing . You are fed up w i t h the outside? By and 
by the dreams of the outs ide wi l l disappear because the re i s no n e e d for 
the dreams to c o n t i n u e . 
You wil l n o t t h ink of food—if you th ink of food, t h e n k n o w well you 
are no t fed up. I f y o u th ink of w o m e n , k n o w well you are n o t yet fed up. 
Your dreams will show you w h e t h e r you are really fed up or if there is still 
some l inger ing interest. If a l inger ing interest is there, t h e n finish that, too; 
there is no h a r m in it. If you are really fed up, by and by you will start feel­
ing that the energy is m o v i n g inward on its o w n accord. You are no t do ing 
anything, you are simply sitting there and it is go ing in, it is falling in. 
A n d t h r o u g h that inwardness y o u r c e n t e r i n g wi l l arise. T h r o u g h that 
inwardness n e w interests, n e w enthus iasm, n e w style, a n e w way to live

a repe t i t ion of the o ld . . . m a y b e a little modi f i ed he r e and there , bu t it 
w o n ' t m a k e m u c h difference. So start si t t ing passively and do m o r e pas ­
sive medi ta t ions . 
In my work I am always afraid of losing confidence in myself. 
In fact, we d o n ' t n e e d as m u c h conf idence as we t h i n k we need . 
Conf idence can e i ther be a great qual i ty or i t can be a h ind rance to 
some. For example , foolish peop le are always m o r e conf iden t t h a n in te l ­
l igent people . S tupid i ty has a cer ta in conf idence to it. Foolish peop le are 
159 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
m o r e s t u b b o r n , and because they are bl ind, because they can ' t see, they 
rush a n y w h e r e — e v e n w h e r e angels fear to tread. 
A p e r s o n w h o is in te l l igent is b o u n d 
to have a little hesitancy. Inte l l igence is 
hesi tant . T h a t s imply shows that there are 
mil l ions of oppor tun i t i e s , mil l ions of al­
ternat ives, a n d o n e has to choose. Eve ry 
cho ice is arbitrary, so a cer ta in lack of c o n ­
fidence i s b o u n d to be there . T h e m o r e i n ­
tel l igent y o u are, t he m o r e y o u wi l l feel it. 
So n o t all conf idence is good. N i n e t y -
n ine pe rcen t of conf idence is foolish. O n l y 
o n e percen t is good , a n d that o n e percen t is 
never absolute. T h a t o n e percen t is always 
hesi tant because the re are really so many 
alternatives. You are always s tanding at the 
crossroads, n o t k n o w i n g w h i c h road will 
really be the r igh t one . H o w can y o u be 
conf ident? W h y d o y o u expec t t o b e con ­
fident? 
All roads l ook a lmost the same b u t one 
has to choose. It is a gambler ' s choice . But 
that 's h o w life i s — a n d it is good that it is 
that way. If e v e r y t h i n g was c lear-cut , p rep lanned , prefabricated, and you 
w e r e jus t g iven i n s t r u c t i o n s — " M o v e r igh t and left and do this and 
t h a t " — t h e r e w o u l d be conf idence bu t o f w h a t use w o u l d i t be? The 
thri l l w o u l d be lost. T h e r e w o u l d be no l ight in life then . I t w o u l d be a 
dead rou t ine . 
Life is always thr i l l ing because each step b r ings y o u to ano the r cross­
roads . . . again so m a n y roads, again y o u have to choose . You start trem­
bl ing. W i l l the cho ice be r igh t o r not? H o w to be r ight ly conf ident then? 
To be r ight ly conf iden t is to t h ink abou t all the alternatives and whatso­
ever y o u feel is a little be t t e r t h a n the o thers . . . 
160 
161 
D o n ' t ask for absolute g o o d and absolute w r o n g . In life there is 
n o t h i n g like that. It is on ly a percentage ; o n e is only a little be t t e r than 
the o ther , that 's all. Life is n o t d iv ided like 
t w o polari t ies i n to good and bad. T h e r e 
are a t h o u s a n d and o n e si tuations b e t w e e n 
g o o d and bad. So jus t look a r o u n d o b j e c ­
tively, silently, feelingly, see every possibi l­
ity, u n w o r r i e d , and wha t soeve r feels a little 
b i t be t t e r than o thers , m o v e on it. O n c e 
you dec ide to move , forget abou t o t h e r a l ­
ternatives, because they d o n ' t m a t t e r now. 
T h e n m o v e confidently. 
T h i s is really in te l l igent conf idence . It 
does n o t destroy hesi ta t ion completely . I t 
uses hesi ta t ion. I t does n o t destroy a l t e rna­
tives. Alternat ives are there . It consciously 
broods and con templa tes over all t he al ter­
natives as silently as h u m a n l y possible. 
Intel l igence never d e m a n d s a n y t h i n g i n -
T h e s e are the paths . M a n y are m o v i n g 
to the r ight ; they t h i n k i t is bet ter . You still 
feel that to m o v e to the left is bet ter , so of 
course there i s g o i n g to be hes i ta t ion b e ­
cause y o u k n o w that m a n y in te l l igent p e o ­

H o w can y o u be conf ident? You are n o t a lone here . M a n y in te l l igent 
people are g o i n g that way and still y o u feel that this is r i gh t for you . 
S tand on the crossroads, th ink , medi ta te , b u t once y o u dec ide t h e n 
fo rge t all o the r a l te rna t ives—move. O n c e you dec ide to move , y o u r 
w h o l e energy i s n e e d e d there . D o n ' t be split and d o n ' t let half o f y o u r 
mind t h i n k abou t alternatives. T h i s i s h o w o n e has to use hesi ta t ion. 
A n d there i s no cer ta in ty that y o u are b o u n d to be r igh t . T h a t I am 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
162 
n o t saying. T h e r e i s no way to be cer ta in . You m a y be w r o n g , bu t there i s 
no way to k n o w i t unless y o u fol low the road to t he v e r y end, all t he way. 
B u t my u n d e r s t a n d i n g i s that o n e shou ld t h i n k r ighdy. T h e ve ry 
t h i n k i n g gives y o u g rowth . You m o v e on the r o a d — r i g h t o r w r o n g i s i r ­
relevant. T h e v e r y m o v e m e n t gives y o u g rowth . To me i t i s n o t a q u e s ­
t ion o f w h e r e y o u go. To me the m o s t i m p o r t a n t t h i n g i s that y o u are n o t 
s tuck, b u t go ing . 
E v e n i f this road comes to a dead e n d and i t leads n o w h e r e and you 
have to c o m e back , n o t h i n g to w o r r y about . I t i s g o o d that y o u w e n t . 
T h e v e r y m o v e m e n t has g iven y o u m u c h exper ience . You have k n o w n a 
w r o n g road. You are acqua in ted w i t h w r o n g n o w m o r e t h a n before. 
N o w y o u k n o w w h a t is false; i t wi l l he lp y o u to find ou t the truth.To k n o w the false as false is a great expe r i ence because that is the 
on ly w a y that o n e comes by and by to k n o w w h a t t r u t h is. To k n o w t ru th 
as t rue , the path moves f rom the expe r i ­
ence of k n o w i n g false as false. A n d o n e has 
t o m o v e on m a n y w r o n g roads before one 
comes to the r igh t one . 
So to m e , even i f y o u are go ing toward 
hell , I bless you because there is no o ther 
way to k n o w hell . A n d i f you d o n ' t k n o w 
hell you wi l l never be able to k n o w wha t 
heaven is. Go in to t he dark because that is 
the way t o k n o w light . G o in to dea th be ­
cause that is the way to k n o w life. 
T h e on ly t h i n g that i s i m p o r t a n t i s not 
to be s tuck s o m e w h e r e . D o n ' t j u s t stand 
on the crossroads, hesi tat ing, n o t going 
anywhere . D o n ' t m a k e hesi tat ion your 
habit . 
U s e i t—i t is a g o o d device. T h i n k abou t all t he alternatives. I ' m not 
saying d o n ' t t h ink , d o n ' t hesitate a t all. D o n ' t m o v e like a s tupid m a n and 
r u n w i t h closed eyes, b l indfolded, so there i s no p r o b l e m and y o u don ' t 
k n o w that o the r roads exist. Tha t ' s w h y s tupid peop le are m o r e conf i ­
den t , b u t they have d o n e m u c h h a r m i n the wor ld . T h e w o r l d w o u l d b e 
be t t e r i f there were fewer conf iden t people . 
L o o k a t the A d o l f H i t l e r s — t h e y are v e r y conf ident . T h e y t h i n k G o d 
has given t h e m great w o r k to c h a n g e the w h o l e wor ld . T h e y are s tupid 
peop le bu t v e r y conf ident . E v e n B u d d h a is n o t as conf iden t as A d o l f 
Hit ler , because B u d d h a i s n o t s tupid. He unders tands the c o m p l e x i t y o f 
life. I t is n o t so s imple as H i t l e r th inks , b u t he jus t rushes and p e o p l e fol­
l o w h i m . 
W h y do so m a n y p e o p l e fol low such stupid leaders? W h y do so 
m a n y peop le go on fo l lowing politicians? W h a t happens? R a r e l y i t 
happens that a pol i t ic ian is in te l l igen t—because if he is in te l l igent he 
wil l n o t be a pol i t ic ian. In te l l igence never 
chooses such a s tupid th ing . B u t w h y do so 
m a n y peop le fol low t h e m ? 
T h e reason i s that p e o p l e are n o t ve ry 
conf ident . T h e y d o n ' t k n o w w h e r e t o go, 
so they are jus t wa i t i ng for some messiah, 
s o m e b o d y to tell t h e m that this is t he r igh t 
pa th and to tell t h e m w i t h such certainty, 
w i t h such obsessive certainty, tha t the i r 
fears are dissipated. So they say, "Yes, here 
i s t he leader. N o w we wil l fol low h i m . 
H e r e comes the r igh t m a n — s o conf i ­
d e n t ! " 
T h a t conf idence o f the l e a d e r — w h i c h 
is because of s tup id i ty—helps h i m to 
gather a great fol lowing, because peop le are 
lacking in courage , in conf idence . T h e y 
are s tuck. T h e y are afraid to m o v e . T h e y 
are a lmost paralyzed because of the i r hes i ­
tat ions. T h e y n e e d s o m e b o d y w h o can b e c o m e a to rch and w h o i s so 
conf ident that their o w n fear and lack of conf idence does n o t t roub le 
163 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
164 
t h e m . N o w they can m o v e w i t h this m a n . T h e y can say, "Yes, we are n o t 
conf ident , y o u are. Your conf idence b e c o m e s a subst i tute for us ." 
So conf idence is n o t always a v i r tue . 
In te l l igence is always a v i r tue . So insist on intel l igence. Somet imes it 
wil l m a k e y o u v e r y hesitant , ne rvous . It has to be so . . . it is natural . Life 
i s so c o m p l e x and o n e i s m o v i n g in the u n k n o w n cont inuously . H o w can 
o n e be conf ident? T h e ve ry d e m a n d i s absurd. 
So m a k e in te l l igence y o u r goal and t h e n hesi tat ion, nervousness, 
eve ry th ing , can be used in a creative way. 
J can see that my mind is still childish. Wliat can I do? 
T h e r e are things w h i c h o n e has jus t to be aware of. T h e very awareness 
b r ings t he t ransformat ion; i t i s n o t that after b e i n g aware you have to do 
s o m e t h i n g t o m a k e the change . 
See ing y o u r m i n d as childish, y o u can also see that y o u are n o t the 
m i n d — o t h e r w i s e , w h o is seeing the m i n d as childish? T h e r e is some th ing 
b e y o n d the m i n d — t h e w a t c h e r on t he hills. 
You are on ly l o o k i n g a t the m i n d . You have comple t e ly forgot ten 
w h o i s l o o k i n g a t it. W a t c h the m i n d , b u t d o n ' t forget the w a t c h e r — 
because y o u r reality i s cen te red in the watcher , n o t in the m i n d . A n d the 
w a t c h e r is always a fully g r o w n - u p , ma tu re , cen te red consciousness. It 
needs no g r o w t h . 
A n d o n c e y o u b e c o m e aware that the m i n d i s on ly an i n s t rumen t in 
the hands of y o u r wi tness ing soul, t h e n the re i s no p rob lem; the m i n d can 
be used in the r igh t way. N o w the mas ter i s awake, and the servant can be 
o rde r ed to do w h a t e v e r i s needed . 
Ord ina r i l y the mas ter is asleep. We have fo rgo t t en the watcher , and 
the servant has b e c o m e the master . A n d the servant is a se rvan t—it is cer­
tainly n o t ve ry intel l igent . 
You have to be r e m i n d e d of a basic fact: In te l l igence belongs to the 
w a t c h i n g consciousness; m e m o r y be longs t o t he m i n d . 
165 
M e m o r y i s o n e t h i n g — m e m o r y i s n o t intel l igence. B u t t he w h o l e 
of h u m a n i t y has b e e n deceived for centur ies and to ld indirect ly that the 
m e m o r y i s in te l l igence . Y o u r schools , y o u r col leges , y o u r univers i t ies 
are n o t t r y ing to find y o u r inte l l igence; they arc t r y ing to find ou t w h o is 
capable o f m e m o r i z i n g m o r e . 
A n d n o w we k n o w perfectly well that m e m o r y i s a mechanica l 
th ing . A c o m p u t e r can have m e m o r y , but a c o m p u t e r canno t have in te l ­
l igence. A n d a c o m p u t e r can have a be t te r m e m o r y than you have. M a n ' s 
| m e m o r y is no t so reliable. It can forget, it can get mixed up, it can get 
b locked. Somet imes you say that "I r e m e m b e r it, i t is jus t on the tip of 
my t o n g u e . " Strange, i t i s on the t ip of your t ongue , then w h y d o n ' t you 
speak? 
B u t y o u say i t is n o t c o m i n g , " I t is on 
the t ip of my t o n g u e . . . I k n o w that I 
know, and it is n o t very far—it is ve ry 
close." Bu t still s ome block, some very th in 
b lock—i t may be jus t a cu r t a in—is n o t a l ­
lowing i t to surface. A n d the m o r e you try, 
the m o r e tense you b e c o m e , the smaller 
the possibility of r e m e m b e r i n g it. Finally, 
you forget all abou t it, you start d o i n g 
s o m e t h i n g e l se—prepa r ing a c u p of tea or 
d igg ing a ho le in the g a r d e n — a n d sud­
denly it is there because you w e r e relaxed, 
you had forgot ten all abou t it, there was no 
! ' tension. It surfaced. 
A tense m i n d b e c o m e s narrow. A r e ­
laxed m i n d becomes w i d e — m a n y m o r e 
m e m o r i e s can pass t h r o u g h it. A tense 
m i n d b e c o m e s so n a r r o w that on ly very 
few m e m o r i e s can pass t h r o u g h it. 
B u t for thousands of years a mi sunde r s t and ing has c o n t i n u e d , and i t 
I cont inues still, as if m e m o r y is intel l igence. It is not . 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
166. 
In Ind ia—as in Arabia, Ch ina , Greece , R o m e , in all o ld c o u n t r i e s — 
all the old languages d e p e n d on m e m o r y , n o t on intel l igence. You can

A n d the w h o l e educa t iona l system o f t he w o r l d depends o n m e m ­

T h i s is the p rob lem, that y o u are feeling. 
I am n o t a m a n of m e m o r y . A n d my effort he re is to p rovoke a chal­

I t i s of no use h o w m u c h y o u r e m e m b e r . W h a t i s significant i s how

In front o f m e , y o u c a n n o t h ide y o u r ignorance . In every possible

is such a beaut i ful expe r i ence that the b o r r o w e d k n o w l e d g e , in compar t '

I have heard abou t the a rchb ishop of Japan . He w a n t e d to convert a 
Z e n mas te r t o Christ iani ty. N o t k n o w i n g , n o t u n d e r s t a n d i n g anything

He o p e n e d his Bible and started read ing the S e r m o n on the M o u n t . 
H e w a n t e d t o impress u p o n the Z e n master : W e fol low this m a n . W h a t

He h a d read on ly t w o sentences and the Z e n mas ter said, " T h a t wil l

N e i t h e r y o u k n o w n o r does h e know. Just g o h o m e . " 
T h e a rchb ishop was v e r y shocked. He said, "You shou ld a t least let 
me finish the w h o l e th ing . " 
T h e Z e n mas ter said, " N o nonsense here . I f y o u k n o w some th ing , 
you say it. Close t he book ! Because we are n o t believers in books . You are

then c o m e . I f y o u t h i n k these lines that y o u have repea ted to me are f rom 
Jesus Chr is t , you are w r o n g . " 
Jesus Chr i s t was s imply repea t ing the O l d Testament . He was t r y ing 
his w h o l e life to conv ince p e o p l e that " I am the last p r o p h e t of t he Jews . " 
He had never heard the w o r d Christian, he had never heard the w o r d 
Christ. He was b o r n a Jew, he lived a Jew, he d ied a Jew. A n d his w h o l e ef­
f o r t was to conv ince the Jews that " I am the awaited p rophe t , the savior 
that Moses has p romised . I have c o m e . " 
T h e Jews cou ld have forgiven h i m . . . J ews are n o t b a d peop le . A n d 
Jews are n o t v io len t peop le , ei ther. N o b o d y w h o is as in te l l igent as t he 
Jews are can be v io len t . For ty pe rcen t of N o b e l pr izes go to Jews; i t i s 
simply ou t of all p r o p o r t i o n to their popu la t ion . A lmos t half the N o b e l 
prizes go to Jews , and the o t h e r hal f to the rest of the wor ld . S u c h i n t e l ­
ligent peop le w o u l d n o t have crucif ied Jesus i f he had b e e n saying s o m e ­
thing of his o w n exper ience . B u t he was saying th ings that w e r e n o t his 
exper ience—al l b o r r o w e d . Yet he was p r e t e n d i n g they w e r e his. Jews 
could n o t forgive that dishonesty. 
O the rwi se , Jesus was n o t crea t ing any t rouble for anybody. He was 
I N T E L L I G E N C E

a l i t t le b i t of a nuisance . Jus t l ike t he Wi tnesses of J e h o v a h or t he H a r e 
K r i s h n a peop le ; they are a little bi t of a nuisance. If they catch ho ld of

save you . W h e t h e r you w a n t to be saved o r n o t does n o t m a t t e r — y o u 
have to be saved. 
I t h a p p e n e d that I was sit t ing near the Ganges in Al lahabad, and i t 
was jus t as t he sun was set t ing. A m a n started shou t ing f rom the water, 
"Save me! Save m e ! " I am n o t in teres ted in saving anybody. So I looked

A n d w i t h difficulty . . . he was a heavy m a n , fat. T h e fattest m e n in

I said, " T h i s is some th ing ! You w e r e asking for help, y o u w e r e shout ­

He said, " I t was because I was b e c o m i n g afraid of death . B u t in fact 
I was c o m m i t t i n g suicide." 
I said, "I am sorry, I h a d no idea that you w e r e c o m m i t t i n g suicide." 
I pushed the m a n back! A n d he started s h o u t i n g again, " H e l p ! " 
I said, " N o w wai t for s o m e b o d y else to c o m e . I wi l l sit here and

B u t there are peop le w h o are b e n t u p o n saving you . 
T h e Z e n mas ter said to the archbishop, "Jesus was repea t ing the old

I t i s good that y o u are b e g i n n i n g to unde r s t and that y o u r mind be­

M i n d ' s w o r k i s m e m o r y , w h i c h the m i n d can do v e r y wel l . B u t the

Always r e m e m b e r : Your eyes are for seeing, d o n ' t t r y to listen w i t h

I f y o u r w a t c h e r is clear, t h e n the b o d y takes care of its o w n funct ions, the m i n d takes care of its o w n funct ions, t he hear t takes care of its

A n d life becomes a h a r m o n y , an orchestra. 
J sometimes feel muddle-headed, as if losing my memory. 
M e m o r y o n e day has to go complete ly . If i t is d isappear ing, i t is a good 
sign. To be clean of m e m o r y means to be clean of past, and to be clean 
of past is to be absolutely o p e n and available to the future . M e m o r y is 
not of the future, m e m o r y is of the past; i t is always a graveyard. A n d the 
future belongs to life, to intel l igence, to silence, to meditat iveness . I t does 
not b e l o n g to m e m o r y . 
O n c e a m a n b e c o m e s en l igh tened he does n o t func t ion ou t o f m e m ­

a response, i t b e c o m e s a reac t ion . A n d all react ions fall shor t of t he situa­
t i o n that is ahead of you , because t he s i tuat ion is con t inuous ly c h a n g i n g 
and the answers i n y o u r m e m o r y d o n ' t change . T h e y are jus t dead c o m ­
modi t i es , they r ema in the same. 
Tha t ' s why, as a p e r s o n grows old, he finds himself ge t t ing ou t of 
t o u c h w i t h the n e w genera t ion that i s g r o w i n g . T h e fault i s n o t of the

ory, and m e m o r y be longs to the past and the past i s no l onge r there . T h e 
n e w genera t ion is m o r e responsive to the p re sen t—tha t creates the gap. 
T h e o ld genera t ion always wan t s old answers, o ld scriptures, o ld saints; 
the o lder they are the m o r e t rue this is. 
E v e r y re l ig ion tries to prove that the i r scriptures are the oldest. I t is 
s t range that they w a n t to prove that. A n d they g lory in the i r ancientness. 
In fact, the m o r e ancient they are, the m o r e useless they are, because they 
have lost t o u c h w i t h reality complete ly . T h e m a n of consciousness and 
w i s d o m , alive, actually responds to the s i tuat ion. O t h e r w i s e all answers 
fall shor t and l ife b e c o m e s m o r e and m o r e a mess. 
So there is no n e e d to be w o r r i e d abou t it, i f y o u are losing your 
m e m o r y and you see that y o u d o n ' t feel any parallel upsurge of intelli­
gence. You wil l n o t feel it. In te l l igence is so subtle that y o u wi l l n o t hear 
the s o u n d of its footsteps. B u t slowly, slowly, i t wi l l t ransform y o u r whole

I f y o u start b e c o m i n g m o r e sharp, m o r e in te l l igent , f rom w h e r e will

E d i s o n is go ing for a lec ture t o u r to a few universit ies. He is saying 
good -bye to his wife and the maidservant is also s tanding there . He kisses

t h i n k i n g that she i s the maidservant . T h e dr iver of the car w h o was t ak ­

O n c e , G e o r g e B e r n a r d S h a w was traveling in a t ra in . T h e t icket

T h e t icket checke r said, " D o n ' t be w o r r i e d , sir. I k n o w you , the w h o l e

T h e t icket checke r m u s t have b e e n taken aback—th i s was a strange 
situation. Shaw was n o t w o r r i e d abou t b e i n g caugh t w i t h o u t a t icket, his 
w o r r y was far deeper . N o w the ques t ion was, w h e r e was he going? A n d 
because he cou ld n o t find the t icket he h a d to go back h o m e on the nex t

B u t for the m o s t part , each m o m e n t inte l l igence i s needed , n o t memory 
M y o w n u n d e r s t a n d i n g i s that i f w e w a n t t o m a k e h u m a n i t y m o r e 
conscious, m o r e alert, m o r e en l igh tened , t h e n the emphasis has to be 
taken away f rom m e m o r y ; t he emphasis has to be pu t on intel l igence. 
B u t for universit ies, for professors, for pedagogues , emphasis on 
m e m o r y is simpler. You jus t ask five ques t ions and if the p e r s o n can 
m e m o r i z e the b o o k s , he can answer t h e m .

I said, " D o n ' t be w o r r i e d . " B u t he was so c o n c e r n e d that he used to 
c o m e early in the m o r n i n g to p ick me up f rom the hostel and take me to 
the examina t i on hall . He was n o t cer ta in w h e t h e r I w o u l d go or not , 
w h e t h e r I w o u l d r e m e m b e r to go o r no t . A n d he w o u l d stand there unti l 
I h a d g o n e in and he w o u l d tell every examiner , " K e e p an eye on this

because he m a y answer w i t h i n o n e h o u r and be gone . Force h im, 
w h e t h e r he has answered o r no t , to be he re for th ree hou r s . " 
I said, " T h i s is strange . . ." B u t the examiners l is tened to h i m be ­

All my professors, my vice chancel lors , eve rybody was so surprised 
w h e n I t o p p e d the universi ty and go t t he gold meda l . N o b o d y was ex­
pec t ing that . B u t a c o i n c i d e n c e — o n e of t he m o s t famous professors of 
Al lahabad Universi ty, Professor R a n a d e . . . I t was wel l k n o w n that in his

m i n i m u m . O t h e r w i s e i t was v e r y difficult even to get passing marks from 
h i m . A n d he was t h o u g h t to be n o t on ly a professor b u t a sage. He had 
w r i t t e n great b o o k s w i t h great insight; there was no d o u b t ab o u t his in­
tel lectual a c u m e n . Just by co inc idence my papers reached his hands. And 
he w r o t e a no t e , w h i c h the vice chancel lor s h o w e d to me because Profes­
sor R a n a d e had w r i t t e n , " T h i s n o t e shou ld be s h o w n to the s tudent ." He 
said, "You are the on ly pe r son in my l ife w h o has fulfilled my desire. I al­
ways ha t ed m e m o r i z e d answers; y o u r answers are so fresh and so short, to 
the po in t . You are n o t a m a n of m e m o r y . I w a n t e d to give y o u a hundred

y o u — t h a t ' s w h y I am g iv ing y o u n i n e t y - n i n e percen t . B u t i f y o u happen 
to c o m e to Al lahabad any t ime, I w o u l d love to m e e t you . In my whole 
lifelong career as a professor, I have b e e n w a i t i n g for you . I w a n t e d these 
kinds of answers. I w a n t e d this c o u r a g e — r a t h e r than answer ing the 
ques t ion , y o u ques t ioned the ques t ion and y o u demol i shed the ques t ion 
completely. You have n o t answered i t because there is n o t h i n g to answer; 
the ques t ion is absurd. A n d w h e n y o u answer a ques t ion , you answer to 
t he po in t . I d o n ' t w a n t to read l o n g answers, w h i c h are all repeti t ive. 
E v e r y b o d y else is w r i t i n g t h e m , n o b o d y is us ing his inte l l igence." 
He was aware of the fact that m e m o r y i s on ly mechan ica l ; in te l l i ­
gence is y o u r real treasure. A n d n o w i t has b e c o m e an absolute fact. In 
t he future, m e m o r y wil l n o t be used at all, because y o u can ca r ry a small 
c o m p u t e r in a p o c k e t w i t h all the answers for all the quest ions that can be 
asked. E v e n absurd quest ions . . . for example , on w h a t day Socrates was 
mar r i ed . O r , w h o was t he first m a n to use the b o w and arrow. E v e r y ­
t h i n g can be r e a d y - m a d e . You can get any answer f rom the c o m p u t e r . 
A n d c o m p u t e r s can be so small tha t y o u can keep t h e m in y o u r 
pocke t . T h e y can be so small tha t y o u can m a k e jus t a w r i s t w a t c h o u t of 
t h e m . On the surface i t wi l l l o o k like a wr i s twa tch , b u t deep d o w n i t i s 
c a r ry ing all the answers that y o u need . Just ask the ques t ion and the a n ­
swer is there . 
You d o n ' t have to be w o r r i e d abou t y o u r m e m o r y . W h a t i s essential 
i s intel l igence. A n d the w h o l e ene rgy shou ld m o v e toward intel l igence. I t

a n o t e b o o k . A n y t h i n g essential, fundamenta l , j u s t n o t e i t d o w n . T h e n 
there is no leakage. Leakage as such never happens . 
Paddy, Sean, and M i c k w e r e ou t h u n t i n g o n e day w h e n they

" N o , n o , " said Sean, " t hose are dee r tracks." 
"Hey, Mick , " they b o t h asked, " w h a t do you th ink they are?" 
B u t before he cou ld answer, all three were hit by a t rain.

I N T E L L I G E N C E 
How can lovers behave more intelligently? 
W h e n y o u have m o v e d in deep relat ionship w i t h somebody, a great need 
arises to be alone. You start feeling spent, exhausted, tired—-joyously tired, 
happi ly tired, b u t each exc i t emen t is exhaust ing. I t was t remendous ly 
beautiful to relate, bu t n o w you w o u l d like to m o v e in to aloneness, so that 
y o u can again gather yourself together , so that again y o u can b e c o m e 
overflowing, so that again you b e c o m e roo ted in y o u r o w n be ing . 
In love y o u m o v e d i n t o the o ther ' s be ing , y o u lost contac t w i t h 
yourself. You b e c a m e d r o w n e d , d r u n k . N o w y o u wil l n e e d t o find you r ­
self again. B u t w h e n y o u are alone, y o u are again creat ing a n e e d for love. 
S o o n you wi l l be so full tha t you w o u l d like to share, y o u wi l l be so over­
f l owing that y o u w o u l d like s o m e b o d y to p o u r yoursel f in to , t o w h o m to 
give of yourself. Love arises ou t of aloneness. 
Aloneness makes y o u overfull. Love receives y o u r gifts. Love empties 
you so that y o u can b e c o m e full again. W h e n e v e r y o u are e m p t i e d by 
love, aloneness is the re to n o u r i s h you , to in tegra te you . A n d this is a 
r h y t h m . 
M a k e y o u r w o m a n o r y o u r m a n also alert t o the r h y t h m . People 
shou ld be t augh t that n o b o d y can love t w e n t y - f o u r h o u r s a day; rest pe ­
r iods are needed . A n d n o b o d y can love on order . Love is a spontaneous 
p h e n o m e n o n : W h e n e v e r i t happens , i t happens , and w h e n e v e r i t doesn ' t 
h a p p e n i t doesn ' t h a p p e n . N o t h i n g can be d o n e abo u t it. I f y o u D O any­
th ing , y o u wi l l create a p seudo p h e n o m e n o n , an act ing. 
R e a l lovers, inte l l igent lovers, wil l m a k e each o the r alert to the phe­
n o m e n o n : " W h e n I w a n t to be a lone that does n o t m e a n that I am reject­
ing you. In fact, i t is because of y o u r love that y o u have m a d e i t possible 
for me to be a lone." A n d i f your w o m a n wants to be left a lone for one 
n ight , for a few days, y o u wil l n o t feel h u r t . You wil l n o t say that you 
have b e e n rejected, that y o u r love has n o t b e e n received and welcomed. 
You wil l respect her decis ion to be a lone for a few days. In fact, you will 
be happy! Your love was so m u c h that she is feeling emp ty ; n o w she needs 
rest to b e c o m e full again. 
174 
T h i s is intel l igence. 
Ordinar i ly , you t h i n k y o u are rejected. You go to y o u r w o m a n , and 
i f she i s n o t wi l l ing to be w i t h you , or n o t v e r y lov ing to you , y o u feel 
great re ject ion. Your ego is h u r t . T h i s ego is n o t a v e r y in te l l igent th ing . 
All egos are idiot ic . In te l l igence k n o w s no ego ; in te l l igence s imply sees 
t he p h e n o m e n o n , tries t o unde r s t and w h y 
the w o m a n does n o t w a n t t o b e w i t h you . 
N o t that she i s re ject ing y o u — y o u k n o w 
she has loved y o u so m u c h , she loves y o u 
so m u c h — b u t this is a m o m e n t she wants 
to be alone. A n d i f you love her, y o u wi l l 
leave he r a lone; you wi l l n o t t o r t u r e her, 
y o u wi l l n o t force he r t o m a k e love to y o u . 
A n d i f the m a n wants t o be a lone, the 
w o m a n wil l n o t th ink , " H e i s n o l o n g e r 
in te res ted in m e — m a y b e he has b e c o m e 
in te res ted i n some o t h e r w o m a n . " A n i n ­
tel l igent w o m a n wil l leave the m a n alone, 
so he can again ga ther t oge the r his be ing , 
so that again he has ene rgy to share. A n d 
this r h y t h m is like day and night , s u m m e r 
and w i n t e r ; i t goes on chang ing . 
A n d i f t w o persons are really 
respectful—-and love is always respectful, it 
reveres the other , it is a ve ry worshipful , 
prayerful s ta te—then slowly you wil l u n d e r ­
stand each o ther m o r e and m o r e . A n d you will b e c o m e aware of the other 's 
r h y t h m and your rhy thm. A n d soon you will find that out of love, ou t of 
respect, your rhy thms are c o m i n g closer and closer: W h e n you feel loving, 
she feels loving. This settles. Th i s settles on its o w n . It is a synchronicity. 
H a v e y o u w a t c h e d ever? I f y o u c o m e across t w o real lovers, y o u wi l l 
see m a n y things similar in t h e m . R e a l lovers b e c o m e as i f they are b r o t h ­
ers and sisters. You wil l be s u r p r i s e d — e v e n bro thers and sisters are n o t so 
175 
I N T E L L I G E N C E

alike. T h e i r expressions, their ways of wa lk ing , the i r ways of talking, their 
ge s tu r e s—two lovers b e c o m e alike, a n d yet so different. T h i s naturally 
starts h a p p e n i n g . Just be ing together , slowly they b e c o m e a t tuned to each 
o ther . R e a l lovers need n o t say a n y t h i n g to t he o t h e r — t h e o t h e r i m m e ­
diately unders tands , intui t ively unders tands . 
If the w o m a n is sad, she m a y n o t say i t is so, b u t the m a n unders tands 
and leaves he r a lone. I f the m a n is sad, the w o m a n unders tands and leaves 
h i m a lone—finds some excuse to leave h i m alone. S tupid p e o p l e do jus t 
the oppos i t e : T h e y never leave each o t h e r a l o n e — t h e y are constant ly 
w i t h each o ther , t i r ing and b o r i n g each o ther ; never leaving any space for 
the o t h e r to be . 
Love gives f r eedom and love helps the o t h e r to be himself or herself. 
Love is a v e r y paradoxical p h e n o m e n o n . In o n e w a y i t makes you one 
soul in t w o bodies ; in a n o t h e r way i t gives y o u individuality, uniqueness . 
I t helps y o u to d rop y o u r small selves, bu t i t also helps y o u to at tain to the 
sup reme self. T h e n there i s no p r o b l e m : Love a n d med i t a t i on are two 
wings , and they balance each other . A n d b e t w e e n the t w o y o u grow. 
Sometimes I have doubts about my intelligence. 
D o n ' t start t h i n k i n g that i f y o u are n o t in te l l igent , t h e n what? Everybody 
is b o r n intel l igent . Intel l igence is an intr insic qual i ty—just as everybody is 
b o r n b rea th ing , eve rybody i s b o r n inte l l igent . 
T h e idea that a few people are intel l igent and a few are n o t is utterly 
w r o n g — a n d has been dehuman iz ing many, m a n y people . I t is very insult­
ing, degrading. All are b o r n intelligent, a l though their intelligences may 
differ in their expressions. O n e is intel l igent in music, ano ther is intelligent 
in mathemat ics , bu t i f you m a k e mathemat ics the c r i te r ion then the musi­
cian looks unintel l igent . I f you put t h e m b o t h i n to o n e examinat ion where 
m a t h e m a t i c s i s t he c r i t e r i o n , t he m u s i c i a n fails. C h a n g e the criterion, 
let music be the cr i te r ion , and put t h e m b o t h i n to the examinat ion where 
music wil l decide, t h e n the mathemat ic ian looks stupid. 
We have chosen cer ta in cri teria; that 's w h y m a n y peop le have been 
c o n d e m n e d as s tup id—they are no t . I have never c o m e across a single pe r ­
son w h o i s s tup id—it does n o t h a p p e n — 
b u t his intel l igence may be a different k ind 
of intell igence. P o e t r y needs a different 
k ind of intel l igence than be ing in business. 
A p o e t canno t be a businessman, and the 
businessman wil l find i t ve ry difficult to be 
a poe t . O n e k ind of intel l igence is needed 
in be ing a poli t ician, ano the r k ind of in te l ­
l igence is n e e d e d in be ing a painter . A n d 
there are mil l ions of possibilities. 
R e m e m b e r : E v e r y o n e i s b o r n intel l i ­
gent , so that is n o t e x c l u d i n g anybody. You 
jus t have to f ind y o u r i n t e l l i g e n c e — w h e r e 
i t is. A n d once y o u have f o u n d y o u r in te l ­
l igence y o u wi l l be clear. 
Peop le are l iving w i t h unclar i ty because they are l iving w i t h w r o n g 
ideas abou t themselves. S o m e b o d y has told y o u — a teacher, a professor, an 
employe r—tha t y o u are n o t intel l igent . B u t their c r i t e r ion is on ly a c h o -
1 sen cr i te r ion; their c r i t e r ion is n o t applicable to all. T h e universities are 
n o t yet universal. T h e y d o n ' t a l low every k i n d o f intel l igence, they d o n ' t 
accept all manifestations of intel l igence. 
O n c e y o u have accep ted y o u r inte l l igence and y o u start respec t ing it, 
you wil l b e c o m e clear; there wi l l be no p rob l em. 
T h e poe t feels stupid because he canno t be a good businessman. N o w 
this creates confusion. He becomes inferior in his o w n eyes, disrespectful, 
c o n d e m n i n g . He tries to succeed in business bu t he cannot . This creates 
great smoke a round h im . If he simply understands that he is a poe t and he 
is n o t mean t to be a businessman, and to succeed as a businessman wil l be a 
suicide to h i m , he has to succeed as a p o e t . . . T h a t is his intelligence, and 
his intell igence has to f lower in his o w n way. He has n o t to imitate anybody 
else. M a y b e the society will n o t pay for it, because p o e t r y is n o t needed as 
I N T E L L I G E N C E 
178 
m u c h as b o m b s are needed . Love is no t needed as m u c h as hatred is needed. 
Tha t ' s w h y in the films, on the radio, on the television, m u r d e r i s al­
lowed; i t is n o t called obscene. B u t lovemaking is called obscene. Th i s s o ­
ciety lives t h r o u g h ha te n o t t h r o u g h love. If s o m e b o d y is m u r d e r i n g , i t is 
perfectly okay. If s o m e b o d y puts a dagger i n to y o u r hear t and the b lood 
rushes like a founta in , it is perfectly okay. B u t if s o m e b o d y hugs you , kisses 
you , loves you , the society is afraid. 
T h i s is strange, that love is obscene and m u r d e r is no t , tha t lovers are 
c o n d e m n e d and soldiers rewarded , that w a r is r i gh t and love is w r o n g . 
I f y o u accept y o u r intel l igence, i f you accept yourself, y o u wi l l b e ­
c o m e clear, absolutely clear; all c louds will disappear. 
How can I support my own growth of intelligence? 
First b e c o m e m o r e and m o r e alert in small things. Walking along the road, 
b e c o m e m o r e alert, t ry to be m o r e alert. For such a simple process as walk­
ing a long the road you need n o t have any alertness. You can remain stupid 
and walk well . That ' s w h a t everyone is do ing . T h e stupidity does n o t h in­
der you at all. Start f rom small things. Taking your bath, be alert; standing 
u n d e r the shower, b e c o m e very alert. T h a t cold water falling on you, the 
body enjoying i t . . . b e c o m e alert, b e c o m e conscious of w h a t is happening, 
be relaxed yet conscious. 
A n d this m o m e n t of consciousness has to be b r o u g h t in again and 
again, in a t h o u s a n d and o n e ways: eat ing, ta lking, m e e t i n g a fr iend, lis­
t e n i n g to m e , medi ta t ing , m a k i n g love. In all s i tuations t ry to become 
m o r e and m o r e alert . I t is hard, i t is cer tainly difficult, b u t i t is n o t im­
possible. Slowly, slowly, the dust wi l l disappear and y o u r mi r ror l ike con­
sciousness wi l l reveal itself; you wi l l b e c o m e m o r e in te l l igent . 
T h e n live intelligently. You live in such a confused way, in such a stu­
pid way, that i f y o u saw somebody else l iving that way you w o u l d immedi­
ately say that he is stupid. B u t you are d o i n g the same, a l though somehow 
o n e manages n o t to look a t one 's o w n life. 
A m a n c a m e to me and he said, " W h a t to do , O s h o ? I have fallen in 
love w i t h t w o w o m e n . " N o w o n e i s e n o u g h , o n e wi l l d o e n o u g h h a r m , 
b u t he has fallen in love w i t h t w o w o m e n . So b o t h are s t ruggl ing a n d he 
i s c rushed . A n d he says, " I am in misery. B o t h are f igh t ing over m e . " 
A n d natural ly f rom b o t h sides he is b e i n g hit! A n d i f I say to h i m , 
" C h o o s e o n e , " he says that i t is difficult. T h i s means tha t o n e p e r s o n is 
r i d i n g on t w o horses . He says i t i s difficult to choose one . T h e n le t i t be , 
have i t y o u r o w n way. You wil l destroy y o u r life. C h o o s i n g t w o w o m e n 
or t w o m e n as y o u r love objects i s b o u n d to split y o u . You wil l start 
fall ing apart . 
Th i s is s tupid. I t is so s imple to l ook in to the p h e n o m e n o n . M a y b e 
somet imes i t is difficult—it is d i f f icul t—but t h e n too o n e has to choose . 
You c a n n o t go in all t he di rect ions simultaneously. 
I f y o u look, i n to y o u r life y o u wi l l f ind h o w un in te l l igen t ly y o u 
have b e e n behav ing . You read a b o o k and y o u accumula t e k n o w l ­
edge and y o u start t h i n k i n g that y o u know. You have l ea rned the w o r d 
God and y o u t h i n k y o u have k n o w n G o d . You are ready to a r g u e — n o t 
on ly argue, y o u are ready t o kill and b e ki l led. H o w m a n y M o ­
h a m m e d a n s , h o w m a n y H i n d u s , h o w m a n y Chr i s t ians , have b e e n ki l led 
for s o m e t h i n g they have read on ly in a book ! T r e m e n d o u s l y s tupid p e o ­
ple. O n e is f ight ing for t he K o r a n , a n o t h e r i s f ight ing for the Gita , a n ­
o t h e r i s f ight ing for the B i b l e — f o r b o o k s y o u are f ight ing and ki l l ing 
l iving p e o p l e and sacrif icing y o u r t r e m e n d o u s l y valuable life! W h a t are 
you do ing? 
Bu t m a n has behaved in stupid ways. Just because everybody else is b e ­
having in the same way does no t m a k e it intelligent. If all are fools it does 
no t m a k e you intelligent because you are following them. 
I have heard. 
A flock of birds was flying i n t o the sky and o n e b i rd asked 
another , " W h y do we always fol low this s tupid l eader?" 
A n d the o t h e r said, " I d o n ' t know. I have heard that on ly he 
has the map . " 
179 
T h e m a p ! N o b o d y has the map . B u t y o u g o o n fo l lowing the pope , 
the Shankaracharya , t he pund i t , the pol i t ic ian, and y o u t h i n k they have 
t he map , y o u t h i n k they know. Just l ook 
in to their l ives—what do they k n o w ? T h e y 
m a y even be far m o r e s tupid t h a n you are. 
Just l ook at the un in te l l igen t way they are 
living. W a t c h the i r life. Are they happy? Is 
there a dance in the i r life? Is there fra­
grance in their life? Just l o o k i n g at t h e m do 
y o u feel a silence s h o w e r i n g on you? 
N o t h i n g of the sort . Just because they have 
a b o o k and they have read i t and s tudied i t 
for years, i t does n o t m a k e any sense to fol­
l ow t h e m . 
B e c o m e a p e r s o n of k n o w i n g , n o t a 
pe r son o f k n o w l e d g e . T h e n y o u live in te l -
l igendy. 
To me inte l l igence is the basic m o r a l ­
ity, t he basic v i r tue . If y o u are intel l igent 
y o u wi l l n o t h a r m a n y b o d y because that i s 
foolish. I f you are in te l l igent y o u wi l l no t 
h a r m yourself because that is foolish. Life 
is so prec ious , it is n o t to be wasted; it has 
to be lived in deep celebrat ion, in deep 
gra t i tude. 
A n d o n e has to be v e r y careful and 
watchful because a m o m e n t g o n e is g o n e forever. I t wil l never re tu rn . So 
if y o u waste i t in s tupidi ty y o u are wast ing a great oppor tun i ty . Live each 
m o m e n t so totally, so fully aware, that you never r epen t later on that you 
d idn ' t live, tha t y o u cou ld have lived m o r e , that y o u cou ld have enjoyed 
m o r e . Tha t ' s w h a t in te l l igence is: to live life so totally that the re is no re ­
pentance , ever. O n e is always c o n t e n t e d . O n e k n o w s that o n e has lived to

There is a swi tch in t he m i n d . T h e n a m e of the swi tch is wa t ch fu l ­

W h a t is medi ta t ion? Is it a t e c h n i q u e that can be pract iced? Is it an effort 
tha t y o u have to do? Is i t s o m e t h i n g w h i c h the m i n d can achieve? I t 
is n o t . 
All that t he m i n d can do c a n n o t be m e d i t a t i o n — i t i s s o m e t h i n g b e ­
y o n d the m i n d , t he m i n d i s absolutely helpless there . T h e m i n d c a n n o t 
penet ra te med i t a t ion ; w h e r e m i n d ends, 
med i t a t i on begins . Th i s has to be r e m e m ­

do, w e d o t h r o u g h the m i n d ; wha tsoever

A n d then , w h e n w e t u r n inward , w e again

life's exper ience shows us that every th ing

med i t a t ion , eve ry th ing can be d o n e by the 
m i n d ; eve ry th ing i s d o n e by the m i n d ex ­
cept med i ta t ion . Because med i t a t i on is no t 
an ach i evemen t—i t is already the case, it is 
y o u r nature . I t has n o t to be achieved; i t 
has on ly to be recognized , i t has only to be

jus t a t u r n i n g in, and it is available. You 
have b e e n ca r ry ing i t always and always. 
M e d i t a t i o n is y o u r in t r ins ic na ture—it 
is you , it is y o u r be ing , it has n o t h i n g to do 
w i t h y o u r doings . You c a n n o t have it, you 
canno t n o t have it, i t c a n n o t be possessed. I t

O n c e y o u unde r s t and w h a t med i t a t i on i s th ings b e c o m e ve ry clear.

M e d i t a t i o n is a state of clarity, n o t a state of m i n d . M i n d is con fu ­

lost. W h e n though t s disappear, w h e n there are n o m o r e clouds a r o u n d 
y o u , w h e n y o u are i n y o u r s imple beingness , clarity happens . T h e n y o u

gaze b e c o m e s p e n e t r a t i n g — t o the v e r y core o f be ing . 
M e d i t a t i o n is clarity, absolute clarity, of vision. You c a n n o t t h i n k 
a bou t it. You have to d rop th ink ing . W h e n I say, "You have to d rop 
t h i n k i n g , " d o n ' t conc lude in a hur ry , because I have to use language. So 
I say, " D r o p th ink ing , " b u t if you start dropping y o u wil l miss, because 
again y o u wi l l r educe i t to a do ing . 
" D r o p t h i n k i n g " s imply means : D o n ' t do any th ing . Sit. Le t t h o u g h t s 
settle themselves. Let m i n d d r o p of its o w n accord. You jus t sit gazing at 
the wall , in a silent corner , n o t d o i n g any th ing at all. R e l a x e d . Loose. 
W i t h no effort. N o t g o i n g anywhere . As i f you are falling asleep a w a k e — 
y o u are awake and y o u are re laxing b u t the w h o l e b o d y is falling in to 
sleep. You r e m a i n alert ins ide b u t the w h o l e b o d y moves i n t o deep r e ­

T h o u g h t s settle o f their o w n accord, y o u n e e d n o t j u m p a m o n g

After a whi le , suddenly y o u wi l l b e c o m e a w a r e — t h e s t ream is c rys ­

W h e n e v e r a desire passes t h r o u g h y o u r m i n d the s t ream b e c o m e s 
w i d e l y . So jus t sit. D o n ' t t r y to do any th ing . In J apan this "just s i t t ing" i s 
183 
called Zazen; j u s t si t t ing and d o i n g n o t h i n g . A n d o n e day, med i t a t ion 
happens . N o t that y o u b r i n g i t t o you; i t comes to y o u . A n d w h e n i t

y o u w e r e occup ied s o m e w h e r e else: in t hough t s , in desires, in a t housand 
and o n e th ings . You w e r e riot in teres ted in the on ly o n e t h i n g . . . and 
that was y o u r o w n be ing . 
R e m e m b e r , med i t a t i on wi l l b r i n g y o u m o r e and m o r e intel l igence, 
infinite intel l igence, a radiant intel l igence. M e d i t a t i o n wil l m a k e you 
m o r e alive and sensitive; y o u r l i fe wi l l b e c o m e r icher . 
You can go in to med i t a t i on jus t by sitt ing, b u t t h e n be jus t sitting; do no t 
do any th ing else. I f y o u can be jus t sitt ing, i t b e c o m e s med i t a t ion . Be 
comple t e ly in the sit t ing; n o n m o v e m e n t shou ld be y o u r on ly movemen t . 
In fact, the w o r d Zen com.es f rom the w o r d Zazen, w h i c h means , jus t sit­
t ing, d o i n g n o t h i n g . I f y o u can jus t sit, d o i n g n o t h i n g w i t h y o u r body 
and n o t h i n g w i t h y o u r m i n d , i t b e c o m e s med i t a t ion ; b u t i t i s difficult. 
You can sit v e r y easily w h e n y o u are d o i n g s o m e t h i n g else, b u t the 
m o m e n t y o u are jus t s i t t ing a n d d o i n g n o t h i n g , i t b e c o m e s a p rob lem. 
E v e r y fiber o f t he b o d y beg ins to m o v e inside; every ve in , every muscle, 
beg ins to m o v e . You wi l l b e g i n to feel a subt le t r emb l ing ; y o u wil l be

before. A n d the m o r e y o u t r y t o jus t sit, t h e m o r e m o v e m e n t y o u will 
feel ins ide you . So s i t t ing can be used on ly i f y o u have d o n e o t h e r things 
first. 
You can jus t walk , that is easier. You can jus t dance, that is even eas­
ier. A n d after y o u have b e e n d o i n g o the r th ings that are easier, t hen you 
can sit. Si t t ing in a b u d d h a pos tu re is the last t h i n g to do , really; i t should 
never be d o n e in the b e g i n n i n g . O n l y after y o u have b e g u n to feel iden­
tified total ly w i t h m o v e m e n t can y o u b e g i n to feel total ly identif ied with 
n o n m o v e m e n t . 
So I neve r tel l p e o p l e to b e g i n w i t h j u s t s i t t ing. B e g i n f rom where 
184 
b e g i n n i n g i s easy, o t h e r w i s e y o u wi l l b e g i n to feel m a n y th ings 
u n n e c e s s a r i l y — t h i n g s tha t are n o t t he re . 
I f you beg in w i t h sitting, you wil l feel m u c h dis turbance inside. T h e 
m o r e you t ry to jus t sit, the m o r e dis turbance will be felt; you wil l b e c o m e 
aware only of your insane m i n d and n o t h i n g else. I t wil l create depression, 
you wil l feel frustrated. You wil l n o t feel blissful; rather, you will b e g i n to 
feel that you are insane. A n d somet imes you may really go insane. 
If you m a k e a sincere effort to "just sit," y o u m a y really go insane. 
O n l y because peop le do n o t really t r y sincerely does insani ty n o t h a p p e n 
m o r e often. W i t h a si t t ing pos tu re y o u b e g i n to k n o w so m u c h madness 
ins ide y o u that i f you are sincere and c o n t i n u e it, y o u m a y really go i n ­
sane. It has h a p p e n e d before, so m a n y t imes; so I never suggest any th ing 
that can create frustrat ion, depression, sadness—anyth ing that wil l a l low 
y o u to be too aware o f y o u r insanity. You m a y n o t be ready to be aware 
of all t he insanity that i s inside you ; y o u mus t be al lowed to get to k n o w 
cer ta in things gradually. K n o w l e d g e is n o t always good; i t mus t unfold i t ­
self slowly as y o u r capacity to absorb it grows. 
I b e g i n w i t h y o u r insanity, n o t w i t h a sit t ing pos ture ; I a l low y o u r i n ­
sanity. I f y o u dance madly, the oppos i t e happens w i t h i n you . W i t h a m a d 
dance, y o u b e g i n to be aware of a silent p o i n t w i t h i n you; w i t h si t t ing 
silently, y o u b e g i n to be aware of madness . T h e oppos i t e i s always the 
p o i n t o f awareness. W i t h y o u r danc ing madly, chaotically, w i t h c ry ing , 
w i t h chaot ic b rea th ing , I a l low y o u r madness . T h e n y o u b e g i n to be 
aware of a subtle po in t , a deep p o i n t inside y o u w h i c h is silent and still, 
in contras t to t he madness on the per iphery . You wil l feel v e r y blissful; a t 
y o u r cen te r there i s an i n n e r silence. B u t i f y o u are jus t sitt ing, t h e n the 
i nne r o n e i s the m a d one ; y o u are silent on the outs ide, b u t inside y o u are 
mad . 
I f you b e g i n w i t h s o m e t h i n g a c t i v e — s o m e t h i n g positive, alive, 
m o v i n g — i t wi l l be be t te r ; t h e n y o u wi l l b e g i n to feel an i n n e r stillness 
[growing. T h e m o r e i t grows, the m o r e i t wi l l be possible for y o u to use a 
sitting pos tu re or a ly ing p o s t u r e — t h e m o r e silent med i t a t i on wi l l be

A med i t a t i on t e c h n i q u e that begins w i t h m o v e m e n t , act ion, helps 
y o u in o t h e r ways, also. I t b e c o m e s a catharsis. W h e n y o u are jus t sitting, 
you are frustrated; your m i n d wants to m o v e and you are jus t sitting. Every 
musc le tu rns , every ne rve tu rns . You are t r y ing to force s o m e t h i n g u p o n 
yourself that is n o t natural for you; t h e n you have d iv ided yourself into 
the o n e w h o i s forcing and the o n e w h o i s b e i n g forced. A n d really, the 
par t that is b e i n g forced and suppressed is the m o r e au then t ic part ; it is a 
m o r e ma jo r par t of y o u r m i n d than the par t tha t i s suppressing, and the 
major par t i s b o u n d to w i n . 
T h a t w h i c h y o u are suppressing i s really to be t h r o w n , n o t sup­
pressed. I t has b e c o m e an accumula t ion w i t h i n y o u because y o u have 
b e e n constant ly suppressing it. T h e w h o l e u p b r i n g i n g , the civilization, 
the educa t ion , i s suppressive. You have b e e n suppressing m u c h that could 
have b e e n t h r o w n ve ry easily w i t h a different educa t ion , w i t h a more 
conscious educa t ion , w i t h a m o r e aware p a r e n t h o o d . W i t h a better 
awareness of t he i n n e r m e c h a n i s m of the m i n d , t he cu l ture cou ld have al­
l o w e d y o u t o t h r o w m a n y things . 
For example , w h e n a child is ang ry we tell h i m , " D o no t be angry." 
He begins to suppress anger. By and by, w h a t was a m o m e n t a r y happening 
becomes p e r m a n e n t . N o w he wil l n o t act angry, bu t he will r emain angry. 
We have accumula ted so m u c h anger f rom w h a t were jus t m o m e n t a r y 
things; no o n e can be angry cont inuously unless anger has been suppressed. 
A n g e r is a m o m e n t a r y th ing that comes and goes: If it is expressed, then 
you are no longer angry. So w i t h me, I w o u l d allow the child to be angry 
m o r e authentically. Be angry, bu t be deep in it; do n o t suppress it. 
Of course , the re wil l be p rob lems . I f we say, " B e angry ," t h e n you 
are go ing to be a n g r y at s o m e o n e . B u t a chi ld can be m o l d e d ; he can be 
given a p i l low and told, " B e ang ry w i t h the pillow. Be v io len t w i t h the 
pillow." F r o m the v e r y b e g i n n i n g , a chi ld can be b r o u g h t up in a way in 
w h i c h the anger i s j u s t devia ted . S o m e objec t can be given to h i m : He 
can go on t h r o w i n g the object un t i l his ange r goes. W i t h i n minutes , 
w i t h i n seconds, he wi l l have dissipated his anger and there wi l l be no ac­
cumula t i on of it. 
186 
You have accumula t ed anger, sex, v io lence , greed, every th ing! N o w 
this accumula t ion is a madness w i t h i n you . It is there , inside you . If y o u 
b e g i n w i t h any suppressive m e d i t a t i o n — f o r example , w i t h jus t s i t t ing— 
y o u are suppressing all of this , y o u are n o t a l lowing i t to be released. So 
I b e g i n w i t h a catharsis. First, le t t he suppress ions be t h r o w n i n t o t h e 
air; and w h e n y o u can t h r o w y o u r anger i n to the air, y o u have b e c o m e 
ma tu re . 
If I c a n n o t be lov ing a lone, if I can be lov ing on ly w i t h s o m e o n e I 
love, then , really, I am n o t m a t u r e yet . T h e n I am d e p e n d i n g on s o m e o n e 
even to be loving; s o m e o n e m u s t be there , t h e n I can be loving. T h e n that 
lov ing can on ly be a v e r y superficial th ing ; i t is n o t my nature . If I am 
alone in the r o o m I am n o t lov ing at all, so the loving qual i ty has n o t 
g o n e deep; i t has n o t b e c o m e a par t of my be ing . 
You b e c o m e m o r e and m o r e m a t u r e w h e n y o u are less and less d e ­
p e n d e n t . I f y o u can be a n g r y a lone, y o u are m o r e ma tu re . You do n o t 
n e e d any object to be angry. So I m a k e a catharsis in the b e g i n n i n g a 
mus t . You mus t t h r o w eve ry th ing in to the sky, i n to the o p e n space, w i t h ­
ou t b e i n g conscious o f any object . 
B e a n g r y w i t h o u t the p e r s o n w i t h w h o m y o u w o u l d like t o b e a n ­
gry. W e e p w i t h o u t f inding any cause; laugh, ju s t laugh, w i t h o u t any th ing 
t o l augh at. T h e n y o u can jus t t h r o w the w h o l e accumula t ed t h i n g — y o u 
can jus t t h r o w it. A n d once y o u k n o w the way, y o u are u n b u r d e n e d o f 
the w h o l e past. 
W i t h i n m o m e n t s y o u can be u n b u r d e n e d o f the w h o l e l i f e—of lives 
even. I f y o u are ready to t h r o w eve ry th ing , i f you can al low y o u r m a d ­
ness to c o m e out , w i t h i n m o m e n t s there i s a deep cleansing. N o w you are 
cleansed: fresh, i n n o c e n t — y o u are a chi ld again. N o w , in y o u r innocence , 
si t t ing med i t a t i on can be d o n e — j u s t sitt ing, o r jus t lying, o r a n y t h i n g — 
because n o w there i s no m a d o n e inside to dis turb t he sit t ing. 
C leans ing mus t be the first t h i n g — a ca thars i s—otherwise , w i t h 
b rea th ing exercises, w i t h jus t si t t ing, w i t h prac t ic ing yoga asanas, postures , 
y o u are jus t suppressing some th ing . 
W h e n silence comes to you , w h e n i t descends on you , i t i s n o t a false 
187 
t h ing . You have n o t b e e n cult ivat ing it; i t c o m e s to you ; i t happens to 
you . You b e g i n to feel i t g r o w i n g inside you jus t like a m o t h e r begins to 
feel a chi ld g r o w i n g . A deep silence is g r o w i n g inside you; you b e c o m e 
p regnan t w i t h it. O n l y t h e n is there t ransformat ion ; o therwise i t is jus t 
se l f -decept ion . A n d o n e can deceive oneself for lives and l ives—the ca­
pacity to do so is infinite. 
Inte l l igence can be rediscovered. T h e on ly m e t h o d to rediscover i t i s 
med i t a t ion . M e d i t a t i o n on ly does o n e th ing : I t destroys all the barr iers 
that the society has created to prevent y o u f rom b e i n g intel l igent . I t s im­
ply removes t he b locks . Its func t ion is negative: I t removes the rocks that 
are p reven t ing y o u r waters f rom f lowing , y o u r springs f rom b e c o m i n g 
alive. E v e r y b o d y is ca r ry ing the great po ten t ia l , b u t society has pu t great 
rocks to prevent it. I t has created C h i n a Walls a r o u n d you ; i t has i m p r i s ­
o n e d you . 
If you are a Chr i s t i an you are i m p r i s o n e d by the Chr i s t i an priests. If 
y o u are a H i n d u y o u are i m p r i s o n e d by H i n d u priests . Your pr isons are 
different; m a y b e the i r archi tec ture is different, the r oo ms are m a d e differ­
ently, w i t h different mater ia l . A n d m a y b e a few pr isons are m o r e c o m ­
fortable t h a n o thers , m o r e sophist icated t h a n o thers . Of course the 
A m e r i c a n p r i son i s be t t e r t h a n the Ind ian p r i son , far bet ter , m o r e c o m ­
fortable: the radio is available, t he TV is available to the pr isoner . T h e 
Indian p r i son i s b o u n d to be Indian . Indians are l iv ing in such an u n ­
comfor tab le way, h o w can they provide television and radio and comfor t 
to the pr isoners? Impossible . T h e y are there to be pun ished ; they canno t 
be al lowed to enjoy. 
Chr i s t i an i ty m a y be a little be t t e r p r i son than M o h a m m e d a n i s m , but 
a p r i son is a p r i son . A n d in fact a be t t e r p r i son is far m o r e dangerous b e ­
cause y o u may start c l ing ing to it, y o u m a y n o t like to get ou t of it; you 
m a y start lov ing it as if i t is y o u r h o m e . B u t these are all pr isons . 
A n d somet imes peop le get fed up w i t h o n e p r i son and they change 
their pr isons . T h e H i n d u b e c o m e s the Chr i s t i an , t he Chr i s t i an becomes 
188 
t he H i n d u . N o w there are m a n y foolish Chr is t ians w h o have b e c o m e 
H a r e Kr i shna p e o p l e — t h e same s tupidi ty bu t masque rad ing in a n e w 
fo rm. T h e r e are m a n y H i n d u s w h o have b e c o m e Chr is t ians , b u t the same 
supersti t iousness persists; there is no difference at all. I have seen those 
H i n d u s w h o have b e c o m e Chr i s t i ans—no change. I have seen those C h r i s ­
tians w h o have b e c o m e H i n d u s — n o change . T h e y have jus t c h a n g e d the

To c o m e ou t of all pr i sons i s i n t e l l i gence—and never to get i n to a n ­
o the r again. Inte l l igence can be discovered t h r o u g h med i t a t i on because 
all those pr isons exist in y o u r m i n d . T h e y c a n n o t reach y o u r be ing , for­

A n d w h e n y o u are o u t o f t he m i n d , w a t c h i n g it, b e i n g aware o f it,
