MASTER,
DAIO	ONCE	SAID	TO	A	MONK:	THE	PEAK	EXPERIENCE,	THE	FINAL
ACT	--	AS
SOON	AS	YOU	TRY	TO	PURSUE	IT	IN	THOUGHT,	THERE	ARE	WHITE
CLOUDS
FOR	A	THOUSAND	MILES.	BUT	EVEN	IF	YOU	GO	BACK	UPON	SEEING
THE
MONASTERY	 FLAGPOLE	 AT	 A	 DISTANCE,	 OR	 HEAD	 OFF	 FREELY
UPON	SEEING
A	 BECKONING	 HAND,	 THIS	 IS	 STILL	 ONLY	 HALF	 THE	 ISSUE;	 IT	 IS
NOT	YET	THE
STRATEGIC	ACTION	OF	THE	WHOLE	CAPABILITY.
YOU	HAVE	TRAVELED	AND	STUDIED	VARIOUS	PLACES	AND	SPENT
A	LONG
TIME	IN	MONASTERIES.	DON'T	STICK	TO	THE	RUTS	IN	THE	ROAD	OF
THE
ANCIENTS	--	YOU	MUST	TRAVEL	A	LIVING	ROAD	ON	YOUR	OWN.
EAST,	 WEST,	 FOOT	 UP,	 FOOT	 DOWN,	 USING	 IT	 DIRECTLY	 --	 ONLY
THEN	WILL
YOU	KNOW	THAT	THE	PEAK	EXPERIENCE	ILLUMINES	THE	HEAVENS
AND
COVERS	THE	EARTH,	ILLUMINES	THE	PAST	AND	FLASHES	THROUGH
THE
PRESENT.	THIS	IS	YOUR	OWN	PLACE	TO	SETTLE	AND	LIVE.	WHEN	I
SAY	 THIS,	 I	 AM	 ONLY	 USING	WATER	 TO	 OFFER	 FLOWERS,	 NEVER
ADDING	ANYTHING
EXTRA.
ON	ANOTHER	OCCASION	DAIO	SAID	TO	A	ZEN	NUN,	"AT	THE	TOP	OF
THE
HUNDRED-FOOT	POLE,	GO	FORWARD."
THE	 NUN	 REPLIED,	 "AT	 THE	 TOP	 OF	 THE	 HUNDRED-FOOT	 POLE,
THERE	IS	NO
PLACE	TO	GO."
DAIO	SAID,	"WHERE	THERE	IS	NO	PLACE	TO	STEP,	GO	A	HUNDRED
THOUSAND	STEPS	FARTHER	 --	ONLY	THEN	WILL	YOU	BE	ABLE	TO
WALK
ALONE	 IN	 THE	 RED	 SKIES,	 PERVADING	 THE	 UNIVERSE	 AS	 YOUR
WHOLE
BODY."
THE	NUN	AGREED	AND	DAIO	CONTINUED:	"THAT'S	ALL.	NOW	YOU
WANT
TO	 RETURN	 TO	 YOUR	 OLD	 CAPITAL	 AND	 HAVE	 COME	 WITH
INCENSE	IN	YOUR
SLEEVE	TO	ASK	FOR	A	SAYING.	 I	ONCE	MADE	A	VERSE	OF	PRAISE
ON	THE
MASTER	OF	IKUSAN,	SO	I	WILL	WRITE	THAT:
"'ATOP	THE	POLE,	WALK	ON	BY	THE	ORDINARY	ROUTE.	IT	IS	MOST
PAINFUL,	 WHEN	 TAKING	 A	 TUMBLE	 IN	 A	 VALLEY.	 EARTH,
MOUNTAINS,	AND
RIVERS	 CANNOT	 HOLD	 YOU	 UP,	 AND	 SPACE	 SUPPRESSES
LAUGHTER,	FILLING
A	DONKEY'S	CHEEKS.'
"I	ASK	YOU,	ZEN	NUN,"	CONTINUED	DAIO,	"TO	BRING	THIS	UP	AND
LOOK	AT
IT	TIME	AND	AGAIN:	HOW	TO	GO	FORWARD	FROM	ATOP	THE	POLE?
SUDDENLY,	 WHEN	 THE	 TIME	 COMES,	 YOU	 CAN	 GO	 FORWARD	 A
STEP,	AND
SPACE	WILL	SURELY	SWALLOW	A	LAUGH.	REMEMBER,	REMEMBER."

Chapter	1	-	Remember,	remember!
Maneesha,	 before	 I	 discuss	 these	 very	 significant	 statements,	 I	 have	 to
inaugurate	Avirbhava's	Museum	of	Gods.	She	has	brought	a	few	great	gods,	but
before	she	brings	her	gods	before	you	I	have	to	say	something	about	them.
"Octopus:	 On	 the	 island	 of	 Corfu	 in	 the	 Greek	 archipelago,	 the	 octopus	 was
worshipped	as	an	incarnation	of	one	of	the	Greek	gods.
Known	as	 the	most	 evil	 of	 the	 sea	 animals,	 the	 innocent	 octopus	 acquired	 the
name
'devil-fish'	by	fearful	ancient	fishermen."
The	second	is,	"Crocodile:	Among	the	southern	Bantus	of	Africa,	the	crocodile
is	considered	sacrosanct.
The	 Egyptian	 god	 Sebek	 was	 believed	 to	 take	 the	 shape	 of	 a	 crocodile;
sometimes	 he	 was	 represented	 as	 wholly	 animal,	 sometimes	 only	 with	 a
crocodile	 head.	 Offerings	 of	 cake,	 meat,	 and	 honey	 wine	 were	 made	 to	 the
sacred	crocodiles,	some	of	which	were	tamed	by	priests.
Oracles	were	drawn	from	the	crocodiles'	behavior,	and	 they	were	embalmed	at
death."
And	 the	 third	 is,	"Lobster:	The	 lobster	was	generally	considered	sacred	among
the	ancient	Greeks.
In	New	Caledonia,	the	crab	goddess,	or	demon,	is	known	to	have	a	sacred	grove.
On	the	trees	in	her	grove	are	hung	little	packets	of	food	for	her.	She	is	the	enemy
of	married	people,	and	is	known	to	cause	elephantiasis.
Even	today,	the	lobster	is	worshipped	in	the	Isa	district	fishing	villages	of	Japan.
Huge	replicas	are	paraded	through	the	towns	during	their	festivals."
Before	 I	 ask	Avirbhava	 to	bring	her	newly	acquired	gods,	 I	 have	heard	a	 joke
about	an	octopus:
Klopski	is	overjoyed	with	his	new	pet	octopus,	Clyde.	The	magnificent	creature
drinks	vodka	like	a	fish,	but	also	can	play	any	musical	instrument	in	the	world.
One	 evening,	 after	 polishing	 off	 a	 few	 bottles	 of	 vodka	 together,	 Clyde	 and
Klopski	go	out	to	the	Jumpin'	Jellyfish	Jazz	Club.
Klopski	 shouts,	 "Hey,	 everybody!	 I	will	 bet	 anyone	 here	 that	my	 octopus	 can
play	anything	anyone	gives	him."
Laughter	fills	the	bar.	Then	Benny	the	banjo	player	says,	"Okay,	I	bet	you	fifty
dollars	he	can't	play	my	banjo."
Klopski	nods	enthusiastically,	 swallows	back	a	shot	of	vodka	and	gives	one	 to
Clyde.	The	octopus	swallows	his	drink	and	crawls	onto	the	stage,	grabbing	not
one	but	two	banjos	on	the	way.
As	he	plays	"God	Save	The	Queen,"	he	sneaks	out	a	free	tentacle	and	snatches
another	glass	of	vodka.
"Hey,	 man,"	 yells	 Pete	 the	 piano	 player,	 "that	 is	 cool.	 But	 I	 will	 bet	 you	 a
hundred	bucks	he	can't	play	my	grand	piano."
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence

Chapter	1	-	Remember,	remember!
"Right!"	yells	Klopski,	swallowing	his	vodka,	and	pouring	one	for	the	octopus.
Clyde	knocks	back	the	vodka	and	jumps	on	the	piano.	Waving	all	his	arms	about
wildly,	Clyde	plays	the	Polish	national	anthem	stylishly.
"That	 is	fine,"	comes	a	shout	from	the	corner,	"but	I	will	bet	you	five	hundred
dollars	he	will	never	be	able	to	play	this!"	It	is	Hamish	MacTavish,	and	be	brings
a	big,	old	Scottish	bagpipe	up	to	Klopski.
"Okay,"	 says	 Klopski.	 But	 before	 Klopski	 can	 touch	 it,	 Clyde	 leaps	 on	 the
bagpipe,	 squeezing	and	 tangling	his	arms	all	over	 it.	Then	 the	octopus	and	 the
bagpipe	 fall	 onto	 the	 floor	 in	 a	 knotted	 heap,	 making	 only	 a	 pitiful	 gasping
sound.
Losing	the	bet,	an	enraged	Klopski	grabs	the	octopus,	holds	him	up	in	the	air	and
cries,
"What	the	hell	went	wrong	with	you?"
"Well,"	grins	the	octopus,	drunkenly,	"she	looked	so	beautiful,	but	I	just	couldn't
get	her	cotton	panties	off!"
Now,	Avirbhava,	come	on.
(A	GREY	VELVETY	OCTOPUS	APPEARS	 IN	 FRONT	OF	 THE	 PODIUM,
HOLDING
BETWEEN	HIS	 TENTACLES	A	 FLUTE,	 PLAYING	THE	BEATLES	 TUNE
"IN	AN
OCTOPUS'	 GARDEN",	 AND	 DANCING	 UP	 AND	 DOWN	 IN	 FRONT	 OF
THE	MASTER.)	So	let	him	settle	on	the	Stonehead,	now	...
(BUT	 THE	 OCTOPUS	 LANDS	 ON	 NIRVANO'S	 HEAD	 INSTEAD.
MEANWHILE,	 A	 LARGE	 CROCODILE	 IS	 INCHING	 ALONG	 THE
PODIUM,	WHILE	A	RED,	CUDDLY
LOBSTER	IS	DANCING	IN	THE	AIR.	FINALLY,	THE	OCTOPUS	GETS	TO
HIS
DESTINATION	 --	 STONEHEAD'S	HEAD.	THE	MASTER	 IS	CHUCKLING
AND
ENJOYING	 THE	 SHOW	 TREMENDOUSLY,	 AS	 WELL	 AS	 THE
ASSEMBLY,	WHICH	IS
SIMPLY	DROWNING	IN	AN	OCEAN	OF	LAUGHTER.)
Great,	Avirbhava!	Take	your	gods	away.
DAIO	ONCE	SAID	TO	A	MONK:

WHOLE	CAPABILITY.
YOU	HAVE	TRAVELED	AND	STUDIED	VARIOUS	PLACES	AND	SPENT
A	LONG
TIME	IN	MONASTERIES.	DON'T	STICK	TO	THE	RUTS	IN	THE	ROAD	OF
THE
ANCIENTS	--	YOU	MUST	TRAVEL	A	LIVING	ROAD	ON	YOUR	OWN.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence

Chapter	1	-	Remember,	remember!
THIS	CAN	BE	CALLED	ONE	OF	THE	VERY	FUNDAMENTALS	OF	ZEN:
DON'T
STICK	TO	THE	RUTS	IN	THE	ROADS	OF	THE	ANCIENTS	--	YOU	MUST
TRAVEL	A	LIVING	ROAD	ON	YOUR	OWN.
The	 fact	 is,	 you	 cannot	 travel	 on	 anybody's	 road	 because	 that	 road	will	 never
lead	you	to	yourself.	It	will	lead	you	to	somebody	else,	whose	road	it	is.	Never
be	a	follower;	always	be	a	path	finder.	And	the	path	 in	 the	unknown	reality	of
your	 inner	 world	 is	 made	 by	 walking	 into	 the	 unknown,	 without	 any	 road
prepared	by	others	for	you.
All	the	religions	are	doing	that:	they	are	preparing	roads	for	millions	of	people	--
highways,	super	highways.	There	are	six	hundred	million	Catholics	walking	on
one	road.
They	are	not	going	to	reach	anywhere;	not	a	single	one	of	them	has	reached	even
to	 the	 state	 of	 Jesus	 Christ.	 And	 nobody	 even	 thinks	 about	 it.	 Six	 hundred
million	 Catholics	 for	 eighteen	 hundred	 years	 following	 a	 certain	 road
persistently,	and	they	have	not	produced	a	single	Jesus	worth	the	name.	It	is	not
their	 fault,	 it	 is	our	whole	mental	makeup.	We	have	been	 told	 that	we	have	 to
walk	on	paths	which	are	prepared.	But	this	is	a	different	path.
All	paths	that	go	outwards	are	prepared	beforehand.	You	can	go	to	the	north,	you
can	go	to	the	south;	you	can	go	anywhere,	the	road	is	ready.	But	to	go	inside,	no
road	 is	 ready,	 you	will	 have	 to	 create	 it	 by	walking.	 It	will	 remain	 always	 an
individual	 pathway.	Nobody	 else	will	 ever	walk	 on	 it	 and	 nobody	 else	 should
ever	walk	 on	 it,	 because	 that	will	 lead	 him	 into	 a	 hypocrisy.	He	will	 become
someone	else	that	he	is	not.	It	is	a	very	important	message:	DON'T	STICK	TO
THE	RUTS	IN	THE	ROAD	OF	THE	ANCIENTS.
All	the	religions	emphasize	the	opposite;	all	the	religions	try	to	prove	that	they
are	the	most	ancient	--	to	be	an	ancient	religion	is	a	great	value.	The	reality	is,
the	 more	 ancient	 a	 religion	 is,	 the	 more	 rotten	 it	 is	 bound	 to	 be.	 The	 more
ancient,	the	farther	away	from	you.
There	is	no	question	of	following	any	ancient	way.	You	should	not	follow	even	a
modern	way,	because	all	ways	that	are	created	by	others	may	only	be	suitable	for
them.
This	is	a	great	challenge	of	existence,	that	you	have	to	create	your	own	path	to
your	 own	 temple.	 No	 help	 is	 possible,	 and	 it	 is	 the	 grandeur	 of	 humanity,	 a
tremendous	dignity,	that	you	can	follow	only	your	own	path.
All	 religions	 are	 leading	 people	 wrongly;	 they	 are	 destroying	 people,	 making
them	into	sheep.	An	authentic	 religion	will	make	a	man	 into	a	 lion	who	walks
alone,	who	never	walks	in	a	crowd.	The	crowd	never	suits	him,	because	with	the
crowd	you	have	always	to	compromise.
With	 the	 crowd	 you	 have	 always	 to	 listen	 to	 others:	 their	 criticism,	 their
appraisal,	their	conceptions	of	right	and	wrong,	their	values	of	good	and	bad.
In	 the	 crowd	 you	 cannot	 remain	 natural.	 The	 crowd	 is	 a	 very	 unnatural
environment.
Unless	 you	 are	 very	 aware,	 the	 crowd	 is	 going	 to	 crush	 you	 into	 dust.	 It	 is
because	of	this	that	you	don't	find	many	buddhas	in	the	world.	A	buddha	has	to
fight	 inch	 by	 inch	 for	 his	 individuality.	He	 has	 not	 to	 give	way	 to	 the	 crowd,
whatever	 the	cost.	Unless	such	an	uncompromising	attitude	 remains	constantly
in	you,	you	cannot	remain	unaffected	by	the	crowd	in	which	you	live.
And	unfortunately	everybody	is	born	in	a	crowd	--	the	parents,	the	teachers,	the
neighbors.
Nobody	is	fortunate	enough	to	be	born	alone,	so	that	is	out	of	the	question.	You
are	born	in	the	society,	in	the	crowd.	Unless	you	can	keep	your	intelligence	clean
of	the	pollution	that	will	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence

Chapter	1	-	Remember,	remember!
be	surrounding	you	from	every	side,	sooner	or	later	you	will	become	somebody
else,	somebody	who	nature	had	never	intended	you	to	be.
Remember	constantly	that	you	have	your	own	destiny,	just	as	everybody	else	has
his	 own	 destiny.	Unless	 you	 become	 the	 flower,	 the	 seeds	 of	which	 you	 have
been	carrying	within	you,	you	will	not	feel	blissfulness,	fulfillment,	contentment,
you	will	not	be	able	to	dance	in	the	wind,	in	the	rain,	in	the	sun.	You	can	be	in
paradise	only	as	an	individual,	if	you	have	followed	the	path	that	you	create	by
walking	in.	There	are	no	ready-made	pathways.
When	you	enter	 in,	you	enter	 into	pure	space	 --	not	a	 road;	 there	are	not	even
footprints.
Buddha	used	to	say	that	the	inner	world	is	just	like	the	sky.	The	birds	fly	but	they
don't	 leave	 their	 footprints.	Nobody	 can	 follow	 their	 footprints	 because	 in	 the
sky	 their	 footprints	 are	 not;	 as	 they	 have	 flown	 away,	 their	 footprints	 have
dissolved.
The	inner	sky	remains	always	pure,	just	waiting	for	you,	because	nobody	can	get
inside	you.	He	is	saying:
YOU	MUST	 TRAVEL	 A	 LIVING	 ROAD	 ON	 YOUR	 OWN.	 EAST,	WEST,
FOOT	UP,	FOOT	DOWN,	USING	IT	DIRECTLY	--	ONLY	THEN	WILL	YOU
KNOW	THAT	THE
PEAK	 EXPERIENCE	 ILLUMINES	 THE	 HEAVENS	 AND	 COVERS	 THE
EARTH,	 ILLUMINES	 THE	 PAST	 AND	 FLASHES	 THROUGH	 THE
PRESENT.	THIS	IS	YOUR
OWN	PLACE	TO	SETTLE	AND	LIVE.
Following	 your	 own	 path,	 not	 imitating	 anybody,	 you	 are	 bound	 to	 reach	 the
space	where	you	will	feel	you	have	arrived	at	the	home,	where	you	can	settle	for
eternity.
WHEN	 I	 SAY	 THIS	 I	 AM	 ONLY	 USING	WATER	 TO	 OFFER	 FLOWERS,
NEVER
ADDING	ANYTHING	EXTRA.
He	is	perfectly	aware	that	people	may	start	following	him.	Such	is	the	stupidity
of	 humanity.	 To	 the	 man	 who	 is	 saying,	 "Never	 follow	 anybody,"	 they	 say,
"Okay."	But	 their	 okay	means,	 "Now	we	 are	 going	 to	 follow	 you."	When	 the
person	 is	 saying,	 "Never	 follow	 anybody,"	 he	 is	 included	 in	 that	 "anybody."
Then	why	is	he	speaking,	what	is	he	doing?	He	says:
I	 AM	 ONLY	 USING	 WATER	 TO	 OFFER	 FLOWERS,	 NEVER	 ADDING
ANYTHING
EXTRA.
I	 am	 saying	 the	 very	 essential,	 not	 adding	 anything	 extra,	 just	 like	 watering
flowers.
Such	 a	 simple	 thing	 ...	 following	 yourself	 is	 such	 a	 simple	 thing.	The	 flowers
will	start	blossoming,	you	just	go	on	watering	them,	nourishing	them	with	your
attention,	 with	 your	 love,	 with	 your	 silence,	 with	 your	 celebration,	 with	 your
laughter.	Just	don't	add	anything	extra	from	other	sources,	from	scriptures,	from
great	teachers,	from	buddhas.	Nobody	is	to	be	included	on	your	path.	Your	path
has	to	be	absolutely	pure	and	virgin.
ON	ANOTHER	OCCASION	DAIO	SAID	TO	A	ZEN	NUN,	"AT	THE	TOP	OF
THE
HUNDRED-FOOT	POLE,	GO	FORWARD."
It	will	look	a	very	absurd	statement.
AT	THE	TOP	OF	THE	HUNDRED-FOOT	POLE,	GO	FORWARD.
You	will	think	that	man	is	mad.	There	is	no	way	to	go	anywhere,	you	will	cling
to	the	pole.	But	going	inside	is	just	like	this,	as	if	you	are	standing	on	a	hundred-
foot-long	pole.	And	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
6
Chapter	1	-	Remember,	remember!
when	 you	 go	 in	 there	 is	 no	 road,	 just	 pure	 inner	 sky.	 It	 is	 a	 jump	 into	 the
unknown,	but	a	jump	of	tremendous	beauty.
You	 may	 have	 heard,	 or	 you	 may	 not	 have	 heard	 ...	 On	 the	 China	Wall	 that
surrounds	the	whole	of	China	--	it	is	the	biggest	wall	in	the	world	...	It	took	one
thousand	years	to	build;	it	is	almost	a	mountain.	And	it	is	so	wide	that	you	can
drive	 a	 car	 on	 it,	 and	 as	 high	 as	 sixty	 feet,	 seventy	 feet,	 eighty	 feet	 --	 as	 the
terrain	allows.	 It	was	built	against	 the	Mongol	attackers,	 to	prevent	 them	from
entering	 China.	 And	 of	 course	 they	 were	 absolutely	 unable	 --	 a	 hundred-foot
wall	standing	between	Mongolia	and	China.
China	had	suffered	so	much	from	the	Mongols	 that	 it	 took	on	 this	 tremendous
task	--
almost	 inhuman.	 It	 took	one	 thousand	years	 to	make	 the	wall,	 and	millions	of
people	were	engaged	in	the	work.	But	it	had	to	be	done	because	great	Mongols
like	Genghis	Khan	...	he	alone	killed	forty	million	people.	Killing	was	their	joy.
His	 son	 killed	 thirty	million	 people;	 another	Mongol,	 Tamerlane,	 again	 killed
forty	million	people.	The	successor	of	Tamerlane,	Nadir	Shah,	is	thought	to	have
killed	more	 than	any	of	his	 forefathers,	but	 there	are	no	records	available.	The
whole	of	China	must	have	become	so	threatened	by	these	monsters	--
murderers	 for	no	 reason,	 just	 for	 the	 simple	 joy	 they	would	burn	 a	whole	 city
alive	--	that	they	made	this	China	Wall.
A	fictitious	story	is	connected	with	the	China	Wall.	There	is	a	place	in	the	China
Wall	where	it	is	said	that	if	you	stand	there	and	look	at	the	other	side,	you	simply
give	 a	 good	 laughter	 and	 jump,	 you	 never	 return.	Many	 people	 tried	 but	 they
simply	laughed	and	jumped.
And	 it	 is	one	hundred	 feet	high,	a	mountainous	 terrain.	The	 fiction	became	so
much	of	a	reality	that	the	government	had	to	put	soldiers	there	to	prevent	people
from	looking	from	that	place.	Nobody	could	explain	it.	What	happens?	Why	do
they	simply	laugh?	What	do	they	see?
And	then	without	saying	anything	to	anybody,	they	simply	jump.
I	don't	think	it	is	a	historical	fact	but	I	understand	it	as	mythological,	and	a	very
beautiful	 phenomenon.	When	 you	 look	 in,	 you	 are	 looking	 into	 a	 tremendous
nothingness.	And	all	that	the	mystics	have	done	is,	they	have	given	a	laugh	and
jumped.	They	have	simply	said	goodbye	and	jumped.
It	is	so	enchanting,	so	magnetically	pulling;	the	gravitation	is	so	much	that	once
you	 look	 in,	you	cannot	 resist	 taking	 the	 jump.	 It	 is	 risky,	 it	 is	dangerous,	you
may	be	lost.	But	on	the	contrary,	you	find	yourself	for	the	first	time.	You	were
lost	before;	hence	the	laughter.	And	now	you	have	come	home,	which	was	just
looking	 inwards,	 and	 everything	 that	 you	 ever	 wanted	 is	 fulfilled.	 You	 have
entered	the	lotus	paradise.
This	 statement	 --	 AT	 THE	 TOP	 OF	 THE	 HUNDRED-FOOT	 POLE,	 GO
FORWARD	 --	 is	 not	 concerned	with	 an	 actual	 pole.	 It	 is	 concerned	with	your
hundred-foot-long	ego.	That	is	your	pole,	where	you	are	standing.
Look	within	and	take	a	jump!
Then	go	forward.
THE	 NUN	 REPLIED,	 "AT	 THE	 TOP	 OF	 THE	 HUNDRED-FOOT	 POLE,
THERE	IS	NO
PLACE	TO	GO."
DAIO	SAID,	"WHERE	THERE	IS	NO	PLACE	TO	STEP,	GO	A	HUNDRED
THOUSAND	STEPS	FARTHER	 --	ONLY	THEN	WILL	YOU	BE	ABLE	TO
WALK
ALONE	 IN	 THE	 RED	 SKIES,	 PERVADING	 THE	 UNIVERSE	 AS	 YOUR
WHOLE
BODY."

Chapter	1	-	Remember,	remember!
Zen	has	a	language	of	its	own.	It	is	simple,	but	because	we	are	complicated	we
cannot	understand	the	simple	language.	A	hundred-foot-long	pole	...	you	would
never	have	thought	that	it	could	be	representative	of	the	ego.
Once	you	see	the	metaphor,	it	becomes	very	clear	that	everybody	is	standing	on
a	very	long	pole.	And	people	are	trying	to	get	on	longer	poles.	When	Henry	Ford
was	dying,	before	his	death	he	was	asked,	"What	have	you	learned	in	your	whole
life?	 Because	 you	 became	 the	 world's	 greatest	 rich	 man	 --	 from	 poverty	 to
riches."
Henry	 Ford	 said,	 "Don't	 remind	me.	 I	 have	 learned	 only	 one	 thing:	 climbing
poles.	And	when	you	have	climbed	 the	pole,	you	 look	 so	awkward,	 so	 stupid.
Fortunately	 you	 are	 alone	 there	 sitting	 on	 your	 pole.	 I	 have	 learned	 the	 art	 of
climbing	poles,	 that	has	been	my	whole	 life.	I	have	not	 learned	anything.	I	am
dying	without	having	learned	anything	from	life."
But	Daio's	interpretation:
WHERE	THERE	IS	NO	PLACE	TO	STEP	...
'Place'	 is	always	outside.	Inside	there	is	no	place,	 there	is	only	space.	And	you
should	understand	the	difference	between	place	and	space.
You	are	sitting	here.	The	place	you	are	sitting	in	is	one	thing	and	the	space	that
you	are	within	is	another.	It	is	nothing	material,	so	there	is	no	question	of	falling.
There	is	no	fear	of	falling	into	a	ditch.	There	is	no	place	of	any	kind,	just	pure
silence	and	spaciousness.	Where	 there	 is	no	place	to	step,	 that	 is	 the	real	place
from	where	to	begin	the	journey.
Howsoever	absurd,	he	has	said	a	great	truth.
GO	A	HUNDRED	THOUSAND	STEPS	FURTHER	--
ONLY	THEN	WILL	YOU	BE	ABLE	TO	WALK	ALONE
IN	THE	RED	SKIES,	PERVADING	THE	UNIVERSE
AS	YOUR	WHOLE	BODY.
THE	NUN	AGREED	AND	DAIO	CONTINUED:	"THAT'S	ALL.	NOW	YOU
WANT
TO	 RETURN	 TO	 YOUR	 OLD	 CAPITAL	 AND	 HAVE	 COME	 WITH
INCENSE	IN	YOUR
SLEEVE	TO	ASK	FOR	A	SAYING.	 I	ONCE	MADE	A	VERSE	OF	PRAISE
ON	THE
MASTER	OF	IKUSAN,	SO	I	WILL	WRITE	THAT:
'ATOP	THE	POLE,	WALK	ON	BY	THE	ORDINARY	ROUTE.	 IT	 IS	MOST
PAINFUL,	 WHEN	 TAKING	 A	 TUMBLE	 IN	 A	 VALLEY.	 EARTH,
MOUNTAINS,	AND	RIVERS
CANNOT	 HOLD	 YOU	 UP,	 AND	 SPACE	 SUPPRESSES	 LAUGHTER,
FILLING	A	DONKEY'S	CHEEKS.'"
Once	you	have	 taken	 the	 jump	 into	 the	 inner	space,	everything	 is	easy.	Before
taking	 the	 jump	 everything	 is	 difficult.	You	 have	 never	 thought	 that	 you	 have
any	interiority,	you	have	never	thought	that	there	is	any	space	inside.
When	I	say	"your	interiority"	I	don't	mean	your	bones	and	your	heart	and	your
brain.	 These	 are	 all	 outside	 coverings	 of	 your	 inside	 nothingness.	 When	 you
detach	 yourself	 from	your	 body	 and	mind	 and	 heart,	 you	 find	 that	 place	 from
where	the	journey	begins.	That	is	the	true	pilgrimage,	the	only	pilgrimage	that	is
of	any	worth.	All	others	are	unnecessarily	running	here	and	there,	not	knowing
where	they	are	going.

Chapter	1	-	Remember,	remember!
I	have	heard	...	Once	George	Bernard	Shaw	was	caught	in	a	railway	train	without
a	ticket.
He	had	purchased	a	ticket,	but	where	had	he	put	 it?	He	had	much	luggage.	He
must	have	been	like	Avirbhava	--	she	travels	with	twelve	suitcases!	So	he	looked
into	this	suitcase,	into	that	suitcase.	The	whole	compartment	was	filled	with	his
clothes	and	things	and	books,	and	the	ticket	collector	finally	said	in	desperation,
"I	 know	 you,	 everybody	 knows	 you.	 I	 cannot	 conceive	 that	 you	 are	 traveling
without	 a	 ticket.	 It	must	 have	got	 lost	 --	 you	have	 so	much	 luggage.	Don't	 be
worried,	 I	will	not	 come	again,	 and	 I	will	give	 the	message	 to	 the	other	 ticket
collectors	on	the	train	not	to	bother	you."
George	Bernard	Shaw	shouted	at	him,	"You	idiot!	You	think	I	am	taking	all	this
trouble	 for	you?	The	problem	 is	not	 the	 ticket,	 the	problem	 is	 that	without	 the
ticket	I	don't	know	where	I	am	going.	The	train	is	going	so	fast	and	I	don't	know
which	station	I	am	to	get	out	at.
And	why	are	you	standing	here	like	an	idiot?	Just	do	your	work	and	let	me	find
my	 ticket!"	He	was	 a	world	 famous	man,	 but	 he	was	 a	man	with	 a	 very	 bad
memory.
A	 similar	 story	 is	 told	 about	Mulla	Nasruddin,	 but	 juicier.	The	 ticket	 collector
comes,	and	Mulla	Nasruddin	looks	into	everything	--	his	bags,	his	pockets.	The
ticket	collector	is	standing	there	and	he	says,	"You	have	looked	in	every	pocket,
but	you	don't	look	in	the	left-side	pocket	of	your	coat."
Mulla	Nasruddin	said,	"Don't	interfere	in	my	work.	Never	mention	that	pocket!"
He	said,	"You	are	strange.	I	am	simply	helping	you	because	you	cannot	find	the
ticket.
Perhaps	...	why	are	you	leaving	out	that	pocket?"
Mulla	 Nasruddin	 said,	 "That	 is	 my	 only	 hope.	 If	 the	 ticket	 is	 not	 in	 the	 left
pocket,	 I	am	finished.	So	first	 I	will	 look	into	everything	else.	Only	as	 the	 last
resort	may	I	touch	that	pocket.	That	is	my	last	hope,	don't	destroy	it."
"I	ASK	YOU,	ZEN	NUN,"	CONTINUED	DAIO,	"TO	BRING	THIS	UP	AND
LOOK	AT
IT	TIME	AND	AGAIN:	HOW	TO	GO	FORWARD	FROM	ATOP	THE	POLE?"
I	give	you	this	poem.	Remember,	that	this	is	my	message:	that	you	have	to	leave
the	place	and	enter	into	space.
"SUDDENLY,	 WHEN	 THE	 TIME	 COMES,	 YOU	 CAN	 GO	 FORWARD	 A
STEP,	AND
SPACE	WILL	SURELY	SWALLOW	A	LAUGH.	REMEMBER,	REMEMBER."
Don't	be	afraid	of	laughing.	Just	take	a	step	from	place	into	space,	have	a	good
laugh	 and	 just	 go	 on.	We	 are	 doing	 that	 every	 day	 --	 not	 one	 laugh	but	many
laughs.

A	haiku	by	Sodo:
AFTER	THE	MOON-VIEWING,
MY	SHADOW	WALKING	HOME
ALONG	WITH	ME.
AFTER	THE	MOON-VIEWING	...	A	full	moon	--	that	has	become	traditional	in
Zen.	 On	 the	 full-moon	 night	 the	 Zen	 seekers	 don't	 sleep,	 they	 walk	 into	 the
mountains	where	the	moon	has	made	waterfalls	look	as	if	silver	is	falling,	where
the	moon	has	made	the	whole	surroundings	a	dream.
Sodo	says,	AFTER	THE	MOON-VIEWING	...	This	is	called	moon-viewing;	it
is	a	tremendously	aesthetic	experience.
MY	SHADOW	WALKING	HOME
ALONG	WITH	ME.
Such	silence.	Nobody	is	with	me,	just	my	shadow	walking	along	with	me.	After
seeing	this	whole	beautiful	world,	when	you	enter	into	your	home	nobody	will
be	with	you,	not	even	your	shadow.	Your	aloneness	will	be	total.
Every	meditation	is	a	preparation	for	enjoying	the	aloneness	which	is	our	nature.
Issa	wrote:
NOT	YET	HAVING	BECOME	A	BUDDHA,
THIS	ANCIENT	PINE	TREE,
IDLY	DREAMING.
According	 to	 those	 who	 have	 awakened,	 everything	 is	 full	 of	 buddhahood.

HAVING	BECOME	A	BUDDHA,
THIS	ANCIENT	PINE	TREE,
Although	it	is	ancient,	it	has	not	yet	become	a	buddha.
IDLY	DREAMING.
It	is	still	dreaming.	Someday	it	may	wake	up.	This	can	be	said	about	everybody.
We	are	all	unconscious	of	our	ultimate	reality,	and	we	go	on	dreaming,	we	go	on
sleeping,	we	go	on	desiring,	we	go	on	longing	for	this	and	that,	not	knowing	that

Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
WHAT	WOULD	YOU	SAY	IS	THE	ONE,	MOST	SIGNIFICANT	ATTRIBUTE
A	SANNYASIN	OF	YOURS	NEEDS?
My	sannyasins	don't	need,	Maneesha,	any	attribute.	My	perception	of	sannyas	is
to	 be	 just	 yourself.	 If	 I	 say	 any	 attribute,	 I	 am	 imposing	 that	 attribute	 on	my
sannyasins.	My	 sannyas	 is	 absolute	 freedom.	With	 freedom	 of	 course	 a	 great
responsibility	comes,	but	that	is	not	my	business.
There	is	a	special	event	happening	in	the	streets	of	Jerusalem,	and	there	is	great
excitement	 throughout	 the	 city.	 Pontius	 and	 Mrs.	 Pilate	 are	 standing	 on	 the
balcony	of	the	palace,	waving	to	the	crowds	below.	They	are	watching	as	Jesus
and	 the	 procession	 following	 him	 slowly	 make	 their	 way	 through	 the	 streets
towards	Crucifix	Hill.
Suddenly,	 Jesus	 stumbles	 and	 he	 and	 his	 cross	 crash	 to	 the	 ground.	 The
procession	grinds	to	a	standstill.	Slowly,	Jesus	gets	back	on	his	feet,	picks	up	the
cross,	and	carries	on.
"Pontius,	did	you	see	that?"	remarks	Mrs.	Pilate,	out	of	the	corner	of	her	mouth,
as	she	continues	waving	with	a	smile	plastered	on	her	face.
"Yes,	dear,"	replies	Pontius,	"I'm	afraid	he	did	it	again."
"Well,	I	really	don't	care	who	he	is,"	remarks	Mrs.	Pilate.	"If	he	drops	his	cross
one	more	time,	he	is	out	of	the	parade!"
In	 the	 small	 hours	 of	 the	 morning,	 Paddy	 is	 crawling	 along	 the	 street	 on	 his

looking	up,	he	sees	the	outline	of	Police	Officer	O'Leary.
"What	is	going	on	here?"	asks	the	cop.
"I'm	just	looking	for	a	ten-dollar	bill,"	mumbles	Paddy.
"Oh!"	says	O'Leary,	"are	you	sure	you	lost	it	here?"

Relax,	but	go	on	entering
deeper	and	deeper	into	yourself.
The	body	remains	far	away,	miles	away,
the	mind	remains	miles	away.
You	are	just	a	silent	watchfulness,
a	peace	that	passeth	understanding,
a	bliss	that	no	word	can	express.
An	experience	of	eternity	and	immortality

Even	your	silence	will	become	a	song
and	your	no-movement	will	become	a	dance.
Those	who	have	known	this	source
have	become	pure	love,	compassion,	consciousness,	purity.
This	is	your	ultimate	nature.
Life	 is	 only	 a	 school	 to	 bring	 you	 to	 this	 ultimate	 nature.	 Those	 who	 remain
unfortunately	 unaware	 of	 this	 grandeur	 of	 your	 being,	 this	 Everest	 of	 your
consciousness,	are	really	pitiable.
Feel	 this	moment	 and	 the	 silence	 of	 it	 because	 you	 have	 to	 carry	 it	 with	 you
twenty-four	hours.
On	 this	 path	 there	 is	 no	 specific	 period	 for	meditation.	 The	whole	 life	 has	 to
become	 meditation.	 Sitting,	 standing,	 walking;	 waking,	 sleeping,	 meditation
continues	just	like	a	thread	in	a	garland	of	flowers.	It	does	not	show	up	but	it	is
there,	the	connecting	link	of	each	flower.
All	your	actions,	gestures,	are	just	like	flowers,	but	a	consciousness	should	run
through	all	of	them.	Only	then	the	garland	is	a	garland;	otherwise	it	is	just	a	heap
of	flowers.
Let	your	 life	be	a	garland	with	a	consciousness	connecting	every	action,	every

THE
MOMENT	HE	DIPS	THE	TIP	OF	ONE	FINGER	INTO	THE	SEA	AND	LICKS

WILL	 INSTANTLY	 KNOW	 THE	 TASTE	 OF	 THE	 WATERS	 OF	 THE

AND	 THE	 NEARBY	 SEAS,	 OF	 THE	 SOUTHERN	 BEACHES	 AND	 THE
NORTHERN
SHORES,	IN	FACT	OF	ALL	THE	SEA	WATER	IN	THE	WORLD.
Maneesha,	 Hakuin	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most	 respected	 Zen	 masters.	 His	 respect	 is
because	 of	 his	 ability	 to	 express	 the	 inexpressible,	 to	 create	 devices	 that
somehow	 can	manage	 to	 give	 you	 a	 glimpse	 of	 the	 unknown.	He	 is	 basically
concerned	with	the	method.	If	a	right	method	is	used	in	the	right	time	and	ripe
time,	it	is	not	going	to	fail.	If	you	are	on	the	right	way,	it	may	take	some	time	to
reach,	but	you	will	 reach.	The	whole	question	before	Hakuin	 is:	 the	 right	way,
the	right	method,	the	right	beginning.
It	was	Gautam	Buddha's	habitual	way	of	expression.	All	the	great	qualities	that
he	has	called	 for	 in	an	experienced,	 self-realized	man,	all	begin	with	 the	word
'right'.	 For	 example,	 he	 will	 not	 say	 simply	 samadhi.	 He	 will	 say	 samma
samadhi.	 Samadhi	 can	 go	 wrong,	 people	 can	 mistake	 similar	 experiences	 for
samadhi	and	get	lost.
That's	what	happened	 to	Aldous	Huxley	when	he	 took	LSD.	He	was	a	man	of
tremendous	 knowledge,	 particularly	 of	 the	 East,	 and	most	 of	 the	 saints	 of	 the
East	 he	 knew	 well.	 He	 immediately	 said	 that,	 "The	 experience	 of	 LSD	 is
samadhi,	 the	 same	 experience	 that	 Patanjali	 has	 described,	 the	 ultimate
phenomenon."
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
15
Chapter	2	-	Go	like	an	arrow
This	gives	a	clear	illustration	that	Buddha	was	right	not	to	use	simply	the	word
samadhi.	 It	 is	dangerous.	You	can	 find	something	else	and	 think	 it	 is	 samadhi;
there	 are	 similar	 phenomena.	 There	 are	 people	 who	 have	 become	 addicted	 to
opium,	or	hashish,	or	marijuana.
And	these	drugs	have	been	used	for	centuries,	from	the	very	beginning	of	man.	It
is	nothing	new.
The	reason	why	they	became	addicted	is	because	the	drugs	gave	them	a	glimpse
of	 something	 ...	how	 things	 should	be.	They	are	 temporary	glimpses,	 and	 they
are	produced	by	chemicals	so	 they	don't	go	beyond	 the	mind.	But	mind	gets	a
glimpse,	 just	 as	 the	 lake	 reflects	 the	 faraway	moon.	And	 the	 experience	 is	 so
beautiful	that	not	to	repeat	it	again	and	again	becomes	impossible.
All	 the	 societies	 have	 been	 fighting	 against	 drugs	 but	 the	 fight	 has	 not	 been
successful.	 It	will	 never	 succeed	 the	way	 the	 society	 is.	 It	 can	 succeed	only	 if
you	 give	 people	 the	 right	 experience	 of	 samma	 samadhi	 --	 'samma	 samadhi'
means	right	samadhi	--	so	that	they	can	make	a	differentiation,	a	discrimination
between	what	is	right	and	what	is	wrong.	Those	who	have	known	their	buddha-
nature	are	not	addicted	 to	drugs,	do	not	need	drugs	 for	 their	 experience.	Their
experience	is	not	caused	by	any	chemicals;	their	experience	is	caused	by	turning
their	whole	energy	in	towards	the	center	of	 their	being.	That	has	nothing	to	do
with	chemicals.	But	chemicals	can	give	you	an	illusion,	something	very	similar.
Hakuin	has	adopted	Buddha's	habit.	Buddha	never	spoke	about	anything	without
adding	the	word	'right'	first,	because	his	understanding	was	--	and	he	is	correct	--
that	everything	can	go	wrong	if	you	get	caught	up	with	something	similar	which
is	illusory.	And	you	cannot	make	the	distinction	because	you	don't	know	the	real.
Unless	you	know	the	real,	how	can	you	expect	to	make	a	discrimination	between
the	unreal	and	the	real?
It	was	a	great	contribution	of	Gautam	Buddha	 that	he	would	 talk	about	all	 the
qualities	using	the	word	'right'	first.	Samma	means	right.	Because	everything	can
be	 taken	 for	 granted	 as	 right	 if	 you	don't	 have	 any	 experience	of	 it.	Then	 any
illusion,	any	hallucination	...	and	these	hallucinations	will	drag	you	through	life
after	life.
A	man	like	Aldous	Huxley,	one	of	the	most	intelligent	men	of	this	century,	got
caught	 into	 it.	He	became	 addicted	 to	LSD	and	he	preached	 that	what	 he	was
experiencing	was	the	same	as	what	Buddha	experienced	and	Kabir	experienced.
This	 is	 definitely	 going	 beyond	 the	 limitations.	Aldous	Huxley	 has	 no	way	 to
know	 what	 Kabir	 experienced,	 he	 has	 no	 way	 to	 know	 what	 Buddha
experienced.	 Buddha's	 experience	 was	 not	 dependent	 on	 any	 LSD,	 it	 was	 an
inner	experience	dependent	only	on	his	own	consciousness.
LSD	gives	you	unconsciousness,	not	consciousness.	If	you	are	in	a	good	mood
LSD	can	give	you	paradise;	LSD	is	simply	a	magnifying	glass.	 If	you	are	 in	a
good	mood,	a	loving	mood,	and	you	take	LSD,	you	feel	the	whole	world	is	filled
with	 love.	 You	 will	 even	 touch	 your	 chair	 with	 a	 loving	 hand.	 All	 around
everything	will	be	beautiful,	nothing	will	be	wrong.
But	 it	 lasts	only	for	a	few	hours	and	when	you	wake	up,	you	wake	up	in	a	far
worse	world	than	the	one	you	had	been	in	before	you	took	the	LSD,	because	you
have	seen	something	beautiful	and	now	you	see	an	ordinary	world	which	has	lost
its	luster.	You	have	seen	in	LSD
rainbows	all	around;	suddenly	they	have	all	disappeared.	You	have	seen	people
having	auras	and	now	 they	are	 just	 so	ordinary.	But	even	 to	 imagine	 that	 they
had	an	aura	looks	stupid.
But	Buddha	or	Kabir,	once	they	become	enlightened	...	this	enlightenment	is	not
something	 that	 has	 to	 be	 renewed	 every	 year	 like	 a	 license.	 Once	 it	 has
happened,	it	has	happened.	It	may	become	bigger	and	more	mature,	but	there	is
no	way	of	going	back.	That	is	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence

Chapter	2	-	Go	like	an	arrow
the	 criterion	 of	 whether	 you	 are	 hallucinating	 through	 drugs	 or	 you	 are
authentically	meditating.
The	word	 'right'	 has	 to	 be	 understood.	Many	 people	 have	 been	worried	 about
why	Buddha	continually	uses	 the	word	 right	about	every	quality.	They	are	not
aware	 that	 for	every	 real	quality	 there	 is	a	phony	quality	available	 --	"made	 in
U.S.A."	That	phony	quality	is	cheap,	but	it	serves	only	for	a	few	hours,	and	then
you	are	caught	 in	 it	because	 it	 is	 so	beautiful	 --	 again	and	again	 ...	And	every
time	you	take	it,	you	have	to	take	it	in	a	bigger	dose	because	your	body	becomes
immune.	A	moment	comes	when	no	LSD	can	make	any	difference;	your	body
has	become	completely	immune.
India	is	far	more	experienced	with	drugs	because	for	ten	thousand	years	at	least
it	 has	 been	 trying	 to	 use	 all	 kinds	 of	 drugs	 and	 poisons	 to	 create	 a	 cheap
imitation	of	 the	ultimate	experience.	They	have	gone	even	 to	 the	point	 ...	even
today	there	are	monasteries	in	Ladakh	where	they	keep	cobra	snakes.
When	 a	 person	 becomes	 so	 accustomed	 to	 all	 the	 drugs	 that	 no	 drug	 helps
anymore,	then	the	last	thing	is	a	cobra	bite.	The	cobra	bites	on	his	tongue,	then
he	feels	a	little	samadhi.
Otherwise	a	cobra	bite	usually	means	the	end.	And	you	will	be	surprised:	there
are	cases	of	the	cobra	dying,	because	the	man	is	so	full	of	poison.
It	has	been	used	in	India	for	centuries.	Each	great	king	used	to	raise	a	beautiful
girl,	and	from	her	very	childhood	she	was	given	poison	--	from	smaller	doses	to
bigger	 doses.	 It	made	her	 so	 immune	 that	 she	was	 able	 to	 absorb	 any	dose	 of
poison	without	falling	unconscious.
And	the	final	stage	was,	when	she	became	a	young	girl,	blossomed	in	her	youth,
she	could	be	sent	to	the	enemy	king.	There	was	no	difficulty	in	it,	she	had	just	to
move	to	the	other	capital	and	the	king	himself	would	become	interested	in	her.
Those	 girls	 were	 chosen	 from	 thousands	 of	 beautiful	 girls;	 they	 were	 unique
specimens.	Immediately	the	king	would	become	aware	that	there	was	a	beautiful
girl	he	had	never	seen	before,	and	just	a	kiss	from	that	girl	was	enough	to	kill	the
man.
It	is	good	that	nowadays	you	don't	find	such	trained	and	disciplined	girls.	They
were	available	at	the	time	of	Gautam	Buddha.	And	it	was	not	something	that	you
use	one	 time	 and	 then	 throw	away,	 in	 the	American	way.	They	would	kill	 the
king	 and	 they	 would	 come	 home	 ready	 to	 be	 sent	 somewhere	 else,	 because
nobody	could	think	that	the	kiss	of	the	girl	had	killed	the	king.
Aldous	Huxley	and	his	colleagues	are	not	aware	of	the	whole	history	of	drugs.
And	why	was	the	girl	ready	to	take	it?	It	gave	such	a	good	feeling,	such	a	joyful
feeling.	She	was	not	thinking	about	what	she	was	being	prepared	for,	but	she	was
floating	in	a	euphoria.
Buddha	 is	 right	 when	 he	 says	 samma	 samadhi.	 He	 will	 not	 accept	 Aldous
Huxley's	samadhi	as	a	right	samadhi.	It	is	an	illusion.
But	I	wonder	that	nobody	has	criticized	Aldous	Huxley.	All	the	governments	are
against	drugs;	obviously	they	should	criticize	Aldous	Huxley	first.	But	they	don't
have	 either	 the	 intelligence	 or	 the	 experience.	 That	 man	 at	 least	 had	 the
experience	of	the	illusory	--	the	governments	don't	have	the	experience	even	of
the	 illusory.	 But	 down	 the	 ages,	 although	 every	 government	 has	 been	 against
drugs,	this	has	not	made	any	change.	No	prohibition	ever	makes	any	change;	on
the	contrary	it	increases	your	interest	in	the	things	prohibited.
I	am	against	all	prohibition.	My	own	understanding	is	that	if	LSD	can	give	some
glimpse	of	samadhi,	then	all	its	bad	aftereffects	should	be	removed,	because	it	is
a	chemical	and	it	is	in	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
17
Chapter	2	-	Go	like	an	arrow
our	hands.	Those	bad	aftereffects	are	the	problem.	They	should	be	removed	and
an	LSD
number	 two	 should	 be	 made	 --	 clean,	 taken	 in	 complete	 awareness	 that	 it	 is
going	to	give	you	only	a	glimpse.	Its	addictiveness	can	be	taken	out,	and	when
you	know	it	 is	going	 to	give	you	only	a	glimpse	 there	 is	no	harm.	It	may	lead
you	to	the	search	for	the	real.
Rather	than	prohibiting	the	drugs,	what	is	needed	is	to	produce	drugs	which	lead
people	 to	samadhi,	which	give	an	 indication:	 if	a	chemical	drug	can	be	such	a
blessing,	what	will	the	real	thing	be?	It	is	just	a	dewdrop	in	comparison	with	the
real	oceanic	feeling,	the	oceanic	ecstasy.
But	nobody	listens	to	any	right	approach.	Thousands	of	people	are	unnecessarily
in	 the	 jails.	The	number	may	be	millions,	not	 thousands,	and	most	of	 them	are
underage;	 even	 six-year-olds	 have	 been	 found	 taking	 drugs.	 Nobody	 has
suggested	any	solution	for	it.
And	once	a	boy	or	girl,	whatever	their	age,	takes	the	drug,	they	cannot	forget	the
experience.	Everything	else	becomes	just	rotten;	the	mind	continuously	hankers
for	the	drug.
It	is	the	duty	of	the	governments	of	the	whole	world,	through	their	chemical	drug
research,	to	produce	drugs	which	are	not	harmful,	which	are	not	addictive.	Any
bad	 aftereffects	 have	 been	 removed,	 and	 only	 that	 part	 which	 gives	 a	 joyous
feeling,	a	desire	to	dance	and	a	desire	to	find	something	real	is	left,	because	that
feeling	will	disappear	within	hours.
These	drugs	can	be	used	in	a	right	way.	Everything	can	be	used	in	a	right	way
and	everything	can	be	used	in	a	wrong	way,	but	it	is	still	the	same	thing.
Hakuin	said	to	his	disciples:
THE	STUDY	OF	ZEN	IS	LIKE	DRILLING	WOOD	TO	GET	FIRE.
An	old,	ancient	method.
THE	 WISEST	 COURSE	 IS	 TO	 FORGE	 STRAIGHT	 AHEAD	 WITHOUT
STOPPING.	IF
YOU	REST	AT	THE	FIRST	SIGN	OF	HEAT	AND	THEN	AGAIN	AS	SOON
AS	THE
FIRST	 WISP	 OF	 SMOKE	 ARISES,	 EVEN	 THOUGH	 YOU	 DRILL	 FOR
THREE
ASAMKHYEYE	KALPAS	...
Asamk	means	 innumerable,	 and	 kalpas	means	 yugas,	 or	 ages.	 If	 you	 drill	 for
asamk,	for	innumerable	ages,	you	will	never	find	a	spark	of	fire.
What	he	is	saying	is	that	there	are	things	which	have	to	be	done	fast.	If	you	do
them	slowly,	at	the	most	you	may	create	smoke	but	not	fire.	To	create	fire	you
have	to	drill	hard	and	without	resting.	If,	seeing	that	the	wood	is	becoming	hot,
you	say,	"Let	us	rest	a	little,"	the	wood	will	become	cool	again.	If,	seeing	that	the
wood	is	smoking,	you	say,	"Now	the	fire	is	not	far	away	we	can	rest	a	little,"	the
smoke	will	disappear,	the	wood	will	become	cool	again.
The	fire	is	hidden	in	the	wood	but	you	have	to	be	very	continuous	until	you	find
the	spark,	the	flame	jumping	up	from	the	wood.
This	is	a	very	good	example	for	meditators.	You	go	a	little	while	and	then	you
say,	"I	have	to	go	tomorrow	again,	what	 is	 the	hurry?	It	 is	enough,	now	rest	--
and	if	finally	everybody	has	to	become	a	buddha,	what	does	it	matter	whether	it
is	Sunday	or	Saturday?	There	 are	 only	 seven	days;	 some	day	 I	will	 become	a
buddha."	But	if	you	think	in	terms	of	going	slowly,	in	a	lousy	way,	taking	rests,
you	will	never	reach.
Although	the	path	is	very	short,	it	is	short	only	for	those	who	go	like	an	arrow.
The	arrow	does	not	stop	on	the	way,	there	are	no	stations	for	the	arrow.	It	does
not	rest	a	little	while	in	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
18
Chapter	2	-	Go	like	an	arrow
the	air	and	then	go	again,	it	simply	goes	straight	without	halting	on	the	way.	And
that	should	be	remembered	by	every	meditator.
I	 have	 been	 using	 the	word	 'arrow'	 purposely	 so	 that	 you	 can	 understand	 that
going	into	yourself	is	not	a	morning	walk	--	that	you	can	return	from	anywhere.
It	is	not	something	that	you	can	do	in	parts;	you	have	to	do	it	one	day	in	a	single
quantum	leap.	Whenever	you	decide,	then	don't	look	back,	just	go	ahead.
Certainly	 it	 needs	 guts	 and	 courage	 because	 you	 are	 moving	 in	 a	 dark	 and
unknown	space.
You	don't	have	with	you	even	a	lamp	--	no	companion,	you	don't	have	any	map.
And	meditation	 demands	 that	 you	 go	with	 the	 speed	 of	 light,	 so	 fast	 that	 the
journey	of	thousands	of	lives	is	completed	in	a	single	moment.
Hakuin	says:
MY	 NATIVE	 PLACE	 IS	 CLOSE	 TO	 THE	 SEASHORE,	 BARELY	 A	 FEW
HUNDRED
PACES	 FROM	 THE	 BEACH.	 SUPPOSE	 A	 MAN	 OF	 MY	 VILLAGE	 IS
CONCERNED
BECAUSE	HE	DOES	NOT	KNOW	THE	 FLAVOR	OF	 SEA,	AND	WANTS
TO	GO	AND
TASTE	IT	FOR	HIMSELF.	 IF	HE	TURNS	BACK	AFTER	HAVING	TAKEN
ONLY	A	FEW	STEPS,	OR	EVEN	IF	HE	RETURNS	AFTER	HAVING	TAKEN
A	HUNDRED
STEPS,	 IN	EITHER	CASE	WHEN	WILL	HE	EVER	KNOW	THE	OCEAN'S
BITTER,	SALTY	TASTE?
You	have	to	go	to	the	ocean;	one	hundred	feet	or	two	hundred	feet,	that	is	not	the
question.
You	have	to	go	all	the	way.
BUT,	THOUGH	A	MAN	COMES	FROM	AS	FAR	AS	THE	MOUNTAINS	OF
KOSHU
OR	 SHINSHU,	 HIDA	 OR	 MINO,	 IF	 HE	 GOES	 STRAIGHT	 AHEAD
WITHOUT
STOPPING,	WITHIN	A	FEW	DAYS	HE	WILL	REACH	THE	SHORE,	AND,
THE
MOMENT	HE	DIPS	THE	TIP	OF	ONE	FINGER	INTO	THE	SEA	AND	LICKS
IT,	HE
WILL	 INSTANTLY	 KNOW	 THE	 TASTE	 OF	 THE	 WATERS	 OF	 THE
DISTANT	OCEANS
AND	 THE	 NEARBY	 SEAS,	 AND	 OF	 THE	 SOUTHERN	 BEACHES	 AND
THE
NORTHERN	 SHORES,	 IN	 FACT	 OF	 ALL	 THE	 SEA	 WATER	 IN	 THE
WORLD.
But	the	question	is	of	going	to	the	sea,	not	just	going	in	a	lukewarm	way:	"Today
a	few	steps	and	then	we	will	see	tomorrow."	But	tomorrow	you	will	have	to	take
these	few	steps	again.	And	if	this	becomes	your	habit	--	"A	few	steps	today	and
then	we	will	see	tomorrow"	--
if	this	becomes	your	pattern	then	you	will	never	reach.	Always	you	will	be	going
on	 those	 few	 steps,	 and	 then	 the	decision	 that,	 "It	 is	 enough,	now	we	will	 see
tomorrow."
For	the	meditator	there	is	no	tomorrow.
Future	is	not	the	concern	of	meditation.	Future	is	the	concern	of	the	mind;	mind
cannot	 live	without	 future.	 If	 suddenly	all	 future	disappears,	mind	will	be	at	 a
loss	 what	 to	 do.	 Future	 is	 the	 space	 in	 which	 mind	 goes	 on	 weaving
imaginations,	projects,	ideas:	what	one	is	going	to	become,	what	one	is	going	to
achieve.	All	 ambitions	 are	 laid	 out	 in	 the	 future.	 But	 if	 the	 future	 completely
disappears	 --	 suddenly	 you	 come	 to	 the	 point	 where	 you	 see	 that	 there	 is	 no
future	 --	 either	 your	 heart	will	 stop	or	 you	will	 run	 away	backwards,	 thinking
that	at	least	the	past	will	be	there.	But	the	past	is	not	there.
The	past	and	the	future	both	are	in	your	mind.
Existentially	there	is	only	this	moment.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence

Chapter	2	-	Go	like	an	arrow
So	when	you	meditate	today,	do	it	as	if	this	is	the	last	day.	You	may	not	have	any
chance	to	meditate	again,	so	go	all	the	way	to	the	seashore.	And	once	you	have
got	the	taste	of	your	being	--	the	rejoicing,	the	dancing,	the	blessing,	the	ecstasy	-
-	then	there	is	no	problem,	you	know	the	way.	It	is	not	far,	it	is	just	within	you,
just	a	few	inches	away	from	your	mind.	But	once	you	have	to	know	it.	Just	once
you	have	 to	know	it,	 then	 there	 is	no	problem.	Then	you	cannot	forget	 it,	 then
you	 cannot	 go	 away	 against	 it;	 then	 it	 becomes	 your	 very	 life.	 And	 when
meditation	 becomes	 one's	 very	 life,	 there	 is	 nothing	more	 in	 this	 existence	 to
make	you	 richer,	 to	make	you	more	of	a	 splendor.	The	secret	 is	hidden	within
you.
A	Zen	poet	wrote:
WITH	A	PIERCED	NET	--	a	net	with	holes.
WITH	A	PIERCED	NET
I'VE	CAUGHT
ALL	THE	BUTTERFLIES
OF	THE	UNIVERSE.
He	is	not	talking	about	butterflies;	neither	is	he	talking	about	a	pierced	net.	He	is
talking	about	your	mind,	which	 is	certainly	pierced	--	so	many	holes,	so	many
loopholes,	 so	 many	 stitches	 here	 and	 there,	 so	 many	 cracks.	 But	 the	 poet	 is
saying,	don't	be	worried:	WITH	A	PIERCED	NET
I'VE	CAUGHT
ALL	THE	BUTTERFLIES
OF	THE	UNIVERSE.
Just	know	the	secret.	And	the	secret	is	to	go	beyond	the	pierced	net.	Be	a	master
of	your	mind,	then	even	a	pierced	net	is	capable	of	catching	all	the	butterflies	of
the	 world.	 Right	 now	 your	 mind	 catches	 nothing.	 From	 all	 the	 holes	 and
loopholes	everything	goes	on	leaking	out.
Have	you	seen	that	you	are	leaking	continuously?	I	don't	 think	...	but	now	you
will	see.
Basho	says,	sitting	silently	...	It	is	right,	but	he	does	not	know	that	when	you	sit
silently	it	is	not	necessarily	true	that	the	grass	grows	by	itself.	What	seems	to	be
more	 likely	 is	 that	 the	 mind	 leaks	 by	 itself.	 Basho's	 experience	 is	 a	 great
experience,	but	this	is	a	very	simple	experiment	that	you	can	do.	Just	sitting	in
your	 room	with	 closed	 eyes,	 see:	 thoughts	 are	 rushing	 this	way	 and	 that	way,
everything	is	leaking.
When	I	say	go	beyond	the	mind,	I	mean	go	beyond	all	this	leaking	so	that	you
can	find	something	solid	to	stand	upon.	Before	you	take	the	jump,	you	need	to
find	a	spot	at	 least	 to	stand	on,	 from	which	 to	 jump	into	 the	darkness,	 into	 the
unknown	territory	of	your	own	being.
Buddha	 is	 reported	 to	 have	 said	 that	 everything	 that	 is	 great	 is	 bitter	 in	 the
beginning	and	very	sweet	in	the	end	--	and	vice	versa.	That	which	is	very	sweet
in	the	beginning,	for	example	a	honeymoon,	is	very	bitter	in	the	end.	Meditation
may	 be	 entering	 into	 darkness,	 unknown	 territory,	 but	 it	 ends	 up	 in	 self-
illumination,	in	a	great	explosion	of	light.	And	once	the	explosion	has	happened,
you	remain	the	buddha	forever;	you	cannot	go	back.	The	mind	has	Osho	-	The
Language	of	Existence

Chapter	2	-	Go	like	an	arrow
gone,	 just	 as	 a	 shadow	 disappears.	 You	 function	 now	 from	 no-mind,	 and	 any
action	from	no-mind	is	good,	is	a	blessing	to	the	world.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
HAKUIN	 SAID,	 "THE	 WISEST	 COURSE	 IS	 TO	 FORGE	 STRAIGHT
AHEAD
WITHOUT	STOPPING."	BUT	 IF	WE	KNEW	WHERE	STRAIGHT	AHEAD
WAS,	WOULD	WE	NEED	TO	WALK	IT?
It	is	just	a	way	of	saying	it.	There	is	no	problem	in	it	when	Hakuin	says,	THE
WISEST
COURSE	 IS	TO	FORGE	STRAIGHT	AHEAD.	He	 is	 talking	 to	 the	disciples,
not	to	the	students;	he	is	talking	to	the	meditators.
When	 I	 say	 to	you,	go	 straight	 in,	you	don't	 ask	me,	 "Where	 is	 this	 'in'?"	You
don't	 consult	 an	 encyclopedia	or	 a	map	of	 the	world	 --	where	 is	 this	 'in'?	You
understand,	you	know	perfectly	well	where	it	is,	just	you	have	not	gone	that	way
before.
So,	Maneesha,	you	know	perfectly	well	where	you	have	to	go.	Just	go	straight
ahead.
Walking	will	not	do,	not	even	running.	That's	why	I	have	used	the	word	'arrow'	-
-	with	the	speed	of	light.	I	have	used	the	words	'quantum	leap'.	One	moment	you
were	not	a	buddha	and	another	moment	you	are	a	buddha	--	so	fast.
There	 is	 no	 distance	 between	 you	 and	 your	 buddhahood,	 only	 a
misunderstanding.	It	is	something	like,	two	plus	two	is	four	but	by	some	mistake
you	have	been	calculating	that	two	plus	two	is	five,	and	I	tell	you	that	this	is	a
mistake:	 two	plus	 two	 is	not	 five,	 it	 is	 four.	Do	you	 think	you	will	have	 to	do
something?	Immediately	you	see	the	point.
It	is	said	that	psychotics	are	ones	who	think	two	plus	two	is	certainly	five.	They
are	 very	 fundamentalist.	 All	 fundamentalists	 are	 psychotics.	 They	 know
everything	--	where	God	is	...
They	know	that	the	Holy	Ghost	committed	a	crime,	and	rather	than	hanging	God
on	the	cross,	the	Jews	hung	the	poor	boy	Jesus	--	it	was	not	his	fault.
The	Holy	Ghost	and	God	are	not	separate.	The	Holy	Ghost	seems	 to	be	God's
personality,	his	mask.	Not	to	say	directly	that	God	committed	adultery,	and	with
a	poor	virgin,	Mary,	they	say	that	the	Holy	Ghost	did	it.	And	the	poor	boy	who
was	 born	 out	 of	 this	 criminal	 act,	 they	 crucified.	 They	 should	 have	 crucified
God,	 but	 the	 difficulty	 is	 ...	 In	 fact	 everybody	would	 like	 to	 crucify	God,	 but
where	 to	 find	him?	They	found	 the	only	begotten	son,	so	 they	said,	"It	 is	near
enough.	Crucify	this	fellow	at	least."
The	psychotics	cannot	be	convinced	that	two	plus	two	is	not	five;	the	neurotics
are	those	who	think	that	perhaps	two	plus	two	is	four,	but	they	are	very	uncertain
of	 it,	 very	 worried:	 why	 is	 it	 four?	Why	 is	 it	 not	 five?	With	 five	 they	 were
perfectly	at	ease.	This	is	the	way	psychologists	find	out	who	is	a	psychotic	and
who	is	a	neurotic.
You	 cannot	 remove	 the	 psychotic	 from	 his	 position,	whatever	 position	 he	 has
taken.	The	neurotic	you	can	remove,	but	he	will	 remain	always	worried:	"This
seems	 to	be	 right,	 but	who	knows?	Perhaps	 I	was	 right	before,	because	 then	 I
was	at	ease.	Here,	with	two	plus	two	making	four	it	creates	such	an	anxiety."

Chapter	2	-	Go	like	an	arrow
There	is	no	distance	between	you	and	your	ultimate	reality.	Just	an	about	turn	...
just,	 rather	 than	 looking	 outwards,	 close	 your	 eyes	 and	 look	 in.	 In	 a	 single
instance,	when	you	have	forgotten	the	outside	world	completely	--	the	past,	the
future,	everything	--	and	you	remain	only	in	this	moment,	looking	inwards,	the
happening,	the	transformation,	the	arrival	of	the	buddha	...
Question	2
Maneesha	is	also	asking:
IS	NOT	OUR	UNCERTAINTY,	OUR	GROPING,	BECAUSE	WE	HAVE	TO
DISCOVER	FOR	OURSELVES	WHAT	IS	STRAIGHT	AHEAD	AND	WHAT
IS	GOING
OFF	TRACK?
If	you	look	in	you	cannot	go	off	track,	because	there	are	no	tracks.	There	are	not
two	ways	even.	 It	 is	 the	outside	world	where	 if	you	don't	know,	naturally	you
will	have	to	grope	around.
In	the	inside	world	you	don't	even	have	hands	with	which	to	grope.	The	inside
world	is	a	pure	seeing.
In	 this	country	we	have	called	 this	seeing	darshan.	Darshan	means	 just	seeing.
And	that	does	everything,	you	don't	have	to	do	anything	else.
Before	 you	 do	 the	 seeing,	 a	 little	 laughing.	 That's	 why	 you	 have	 not	 done	 it
before.
Pope	the	Polack	is	visiting	the	optician.
"I	keep	seeing	spots	in	front	of	my	eyes,"	complains	the	Polack	pope.
"Really?"	replies	the	optician,	putting	a	new	pair	of	glasses	on	the	pope's	nose.
"There!
How's	that?"
"Wow!	That's	 great,"	 replies	Pope	 the	Polack.	 "Now	 I	 can	 see	 the	 spots	much
clearer."
Luigi	is	sitting	with	his	teenage	son,	Spagnoli.

Maneesha,	 I	 have	 to	 say	 something	 about	my	 absence	 yesterday	 before	 I	 can
enter	 into	 the	 discussion	 of	 Rinzai's	 statements.	 I	 could	 not	 come	 yesterday
because	Anando	took	all	my	clothes	to	some	dry	cleaner.	First	I	thought	the	dry
cleaner	must	be	in	Poona,	but	by	the	end	of	the	evening	it	became	clear	that	the
dry	 cleaner	was	 in	Bombay.	And	 in	 the	 night	 she	 phoned	 to	 say	 that	 she	was
going	 to	 Switzerland,	 with	 all	 the	 twelve	 suitcases	 of	 Avirbhava	 full	 of	 my
clothes	for	dry	cleaning!
Somehow	 she	 had	 to	 be	 persuaded	 to	 come	 back,	 because	without	 clothes	 the
government	 will	 have	 immediate	 reason	 to	 arrest	 me.	 Fortunately	 she	 has
returned	from	Bombay.	The	whole	credit	of	my	being	here	today	goes	to	her.
FOLLOWERS	 OF	 THE	 TAO,	 SAID	 RINZAI,	 THIS	 MOUNTAIN	 MONK'S
VIEW
DOES	NOT	DIFFER	FROM	THAT	OF	SAKYAMUNI	BUDDHA.
In	fact	he	is	saying	that	not	only	are	his	 thoughts	actually	the	same	as	Gautam
Buddha's,	all	the	buddhas,	past	and	present	and	future,	have	the	same	insight,	the
same	illumination.	But	he	can	say	only	about	himself	for	the	simple	reason	that
this	is	his	actual	experience.	Since	the	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
26
Chapter	3	-	Seek	nothing	outside
moment	when	his	buddhahood	became	known	to	him,	he	has	been	watching	that
every	action,	every	activity,	every	response	is	exactly	that	of	Sakyamuni	Gautam
Buddha.
IN	 ALL	 THE	 VARIETY	 OF	 OUR	 DAILY	 ACTIVITIES,	 IS	 THEIR
ANYTHING
LACKING?	THE	SPIRITUAL	LIGHT	MANIFESTING	THROUGH	THE	SIX
SENSES	...
The	six	senses	have	to	be	noted	down.	Ordinarily	we	talk	only	of	five	senses;	the
sixth	is	dormant.	The	moment	you	turn	in,	the	sixth	sense	starts	working.	Hence
when	the	Buddhists	talk	about	six	senses	it	amazes	people	--	where	is	the	sixth
sense?	It	is	not	visible,	it	is	when	you	close	your	eyes:	suddenly	you	see	a	new
sense	penetrating	in	your	interiority	which	you	have	never	known	before.	It	has
always	been	there,	but	you	have	never	turned	inwards.	So	Buddha	always	talks
about	six	senses.
THE	 SPIRITUAL	 LIGHT	 MANIFESTING	 THROUGH	 THE	 SIX	 SENSES
HAS	NEVER
BEEN	INTERRUPTED.
Now	 it	 should	 be	 made	 seven	 senses,	 for	 the	 simple	 reason	 ...	 Up	 until	 this
century	physiologists	were	not	aware	that	 in	your	ear	 there	are	 two	senses,	not
one.	 One	 is	 the	 sense	 of	 hearing	 and	 the	 other	 is	 the	 sense	 of	 balance.	 The
drunkard	wavers,	wobbles	 as	 he	walks,	 for	 the	 simple	 reason	 that	 the	 alcohol
affects	the	sense	of	balance.	He	wants	to	put	his	foot	in	one	place,	and	it	goes	to
another.	 This	 sense	 that	 is	 hidden	 in	 the	 ear	 has	 never	 been	mentioned	 in	 the
past,	 because	 it	 is	 not	 as	manifest	 as	 eyes,	 ears	 or	 hands.	 The	 poor	 drunkard
suffers	because	of	the	sixth	sense.
So	I	would	like	to	change	the	order.	The	seventh	sense	is	the	buddha-sense,	the
buddha-eye.	The	 sixth	you	all	have.	Somebody	hits	on	your	 ear,	 and	 suddenly
you	feel	the	whole	world	moving	--	that	is	the	sixth	sense.
A	drunkard	is	trying	hard	to	open	the	lock	of	his	door.	His	wife	had	got	tired	of
him;	he	won't	listen,	he	will	come	home	whenever	he	feels	like	it	--	in	the	middle
of	the	night	...	So	she	said,	"You	keep	the	key	and	you	silently	open	the	door,	go
into	the	room,	and	sleep.	And	don't	disturb	me!"
He	 was	 in	 great	 trouble,	 and	 a	 policeman	 on	 the	 street	 was	 watching	 the
difficulty	of	the	poor	man.	He	could	not	manage	to	enter	the	key	into	the	lock;
both	his	hands	were	wobbling.
You	need	a	little	balance	to	make	the	lock	stand	still,	and	you	need	also	balance
for	your	other	hand	which	is	holding	the	key.
The	 policeman,	 feeling	 for	 the	 old	man,	 came	 by	 and	 asked	 him,	 "Can	 I	 help
you?"	 He	 said,	 "You	 have	 to.	 Just	 hold	 my	 house	 while	 I	 open	 the	 door.
Everything	 is	 trembling,	 it	 seems	 there	 is	 an	 earthquake	 going	 on."	 The
policeman	laughed,	and	he	said,	"This	idea	never	entered	in	my	mind."
At	 that	very	moment	 the	wife,	hearing	some	noise,	opened	 the	window	on	 the
second	 story	 and	 asked,	 "What	 is	 the	matter?	 Is	 the	 key	 not	working?	 Shall	 I
throw	down	another	key?"	The	man	 said,	 "The	key	 is	perfectly	okay,	you	 just
send	another	lock	so	that	I	can	open	it."
Just,	everything	loses	its	sense	of	balance.	One	starts	not	only	walking	wobbly,
one	starts	seeing	things	which	are	not	there,	avoiding	things	which	are	not	there,
and	staggering	against	things	which	are	there.	There	is	a	confusion.	To	follow	a
drunkard	from	the	pub	to	his	house	is	a	great	experience.	How	many	great	things
happen	on	the	way,	you	cannot	believe.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence

Chapter	3	-	Seek	nothing	outside
So	I	would	like	for	you	to	remember	that	there	are	seven	senses.	The	sixth,	that
Rinzai	says	is	the	buddha-sense,	I	would	like	to	call	the	seventh.	About	the	sixth
Rinzai	 is	as	 traditional,	conventional,	as	everybody	else.	 It	was	not	his	 fault,	 it
was	 never	 thought	 that	 there	 needs	 to	 be	 a	 sense	 of	 balance.	 It	 was	 only	 the
discovery	of	the	deeper	structure	of	the	ear	that	made	it	clear	to	us	that	we	have	a
certain	sense	of	balance,	too.	From	all	these	senses,	Rinzai	is	saying,	constantly
a	certain	light	is	radiating.
HE	WHO	IS	ABLE	TO	PERCEIVE	IT,	IN	THIS	MANNER,	CAN	BE	AN
UNCONCERNED	MAN	FOR	THE	REST	OF	HIS	LIFE.
VIRTUOUS	 ONES,	 THERE	 IS	 NO	 PEACE	 IN	 THE	 THREE	 WORLDS
WHICH	ARE
LIKE	A	HOUSE	ON	FIRE.
This	 is	 the	 experience	 of	 all	 the	 buddhas.	 There	 is	 no	 peace	 anywhere.
Everything	is	as	if	it	is	on	fire,	and	all	that	you	need	to	do	is	to	jump	out	of	this
fire.	Your	jealousy	is	fire,	your	anger	is	fire,	your	fear	is	fire,	your	love	is	fire	--
all	 that	 you	 are	 living	 is	 nothing	 but	 a	 house	 on	 fire.	 Every	moment	 there	 is
anxiety,	every	moment	there	is	anguish.
VIRTUOUS	 ONES,	 THERE	 IS	 NO	 PEACE	 IN	 THE	 THREE	 WORLDS
WHICH	ARE
LIKE	 A	 HOUSE	 ON	 FIRE.	 IT	 IS	 NOT	 A	 PLACE	 FOR	 A	 LONG	 STAY
BECAUSE	THE
MURDEROUS	 DEMON	 OF	 IMPERMANENCE	 WILL,	 IN	 AN	 INSTANT,
MAKE	NO
CHOICE	BETWEEN	THE	NOBLE	AND	THE	HUMBLE,	AND	BETWEEN
THE	OLD
AND	 THE	 YOUNG.	 IF	 YOU	 DO	 NOT	 WANT	 TO	 DIFFER	 FROM	 THE
PATRIARCH
AND	THE	BUDDHA,	 IT	WILL	 SUFFICE	 FOR	YOU	TO	 SEEK	NOTHING
OUTSIDE.
That	 is	 the	 essence	 of	 the	 message:	 nothing	 to	 seek	 outside.	 Seeking	 for
something	outside	is	entering	into	a	house	which	is	on	fire.	However	much	you
try	...	You	may	even	become	comfortable	in	an	uncomfortable	situation,	just	by
saying	to	yourself,	"This	is	what	life	is."
But	this	is	not	so.	You	may	settle	with	your	sadness,	your	misery	--	everybody
has	settled	with	things	believing	that,	what	else	can	one	do?	Anger	comes,	love
comes,	hate	comes,	and	they	all	possess	you	like	demons.
The	only	way	to	avoid	 this	vicious	circle	--	 from	one	prison	 to	another	prison,
from	one	fire	to	another	fire	--	the	only	way	is	to	seek	nothing	outside	and	turn
inwards.	 There	 is	 no	 seeking	 inwards,	 you	 simply	 find.	Outside	 you	 seek	 and
you	never	find	anything;	inside	you	do	not	seek,	it	is	already	there.
IF,	IN	THE	TIME	OF	A	THOUGHT,	YOUR	PURE	AND	CLEAN	NO-MIND
SHINES,	THIS	IS	YOUR	OWN	DHARMAKAYA	BUDDHA.
Buddha	has	made	categories.	Dharmakaya	means	the	body	of	religiousness.	If	in
the	 time	 of	 a	 thought,	 your	mind	 is	 clear,	 clean,	 no-mind	 shines,	 this	 is	 your
dharmakaya	Buddha.	You	are	 entering	 into	 a	 realm	of	your	 inner	 space	which
can	be	said	to	be	the	very	body	of	religiousness.
IF,	 IN	 THE	 TIME	 OF	 A	 THOUGHT,	 YOUR	 PASSIONLESS	 NO-MIND
SHINES,	THIS
IS	YOUR	OWN	SAMBHOGAKAYA	BUDDHA.
No-mind	shining	itself	is	meditation.	That's	what	is	called	samadhi.	Buddha	has
called	it	sambhogakaya	--	the	body	of	blissfulness.
IF	 IN	THE	TIME	OF	A	THOUGHT,	YOUR	NON-DIFFERENTIATING	NO-
MIND
SHINES,	THIS	IS	YOUR	OWN	NIRMANAKAYA	BUDDHA.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
28
Chapter	3	-	Seek	nothing	outside
Perhaps	 Buddha	 is	 the	 only	 person	 in	 the	 past	 who	 has	 given	 any	 credit	 to
creativeness.
Nirmanakaya	means	the	body	of	creativeness.	Nirman	means	creativeness.
If	 no-mind	 shines	 without	 any	 differentiating,	 your	 whole	 energy	 itself
spontaneously	 starts	 creating.	 It	does	not	matter	what	 it	 creates;	you	may	be	a
potter,	or	you	may	be	a	musician,	or	you	may	be	a	poet.	Whoever	you	are	and
whatever	you	are	doing	--	you	may	be	just	a	housewife	--	your	work	will	take	the
quality	 of	 creativeness.	Your	work	will	 take	 the	 quality	 of	 love,	 of	 silence,	 of
peace.
THIS	THREEFOLD	BODY	IS	THE	ONE	WHO	IS	NOW	LISTENING	TO	MY
EXPOUNDING	OF	THE	DHARMA.
Rinzai	says,	"You	are	all	these	three	bodies,	although	you	are	not	aware	of	them.
You	are	aware	of	only	one	body,	the	skin	body,	which	is	just	a	skeleton.	Hidden
behind	 it	 are	 treasures."	 Buddha	 has	 divided	 them	 into	 three:	 Dharmakaya,
Sambhogakaya,	Nirmanakaya.
THIS	THREEFOLD	BODY	IS	THE	ONE	WHO	IS	NOW	LISTENING	TO	MY
EXPOUNDING	OF	 THE	DHARMA.	 THIS	 CAN	ONLY	BE	ACHIEVED	 IF
NOTHING	IS
SOUGHT	FROM	WITHOUT.
If	you	do	not	seek	anything	from	without,	you	are	complete,	you	are	entire,	you
are	perfect.
The	moment	you	start	desiring	something	from	outside,	trouble	starts.	You	have
already	 descended	 from	 the	 throne	 of	 an	 emperor	 and	 become	 a	 beggar.	 And
once	you	are	a	beggar,	it	will	be	very	difficult	to	find	the	throne	again.
The	 world	 is	 vast	 and	 desires	 take	 you	 far	 away.	Whole	 lives	 are	 devoted	 to
fulfill	childish	desires.
One	of	the	richest	men	of	his	time,	in	1940	...	I	was	a	small	child	and	my	father
was	 sick,	 so	 I	 was	 with	 my	 father	 in	 the	 hospital.	 This	 rich	 man,	 Sir	 Seth
Hukumchand,	had	created	a	really	great	hospital	in	Indore.	He	used	to	come,	and
by	chance	we	became	friends.	He	was	an	old	man	but	he	used	to	come	every	day
and	I	used	to	wait	for	him	at	the	gate.	I	asked	him,
"You	have	 so	much	 ..."	Almost	 three-fourths	of	 the	houses	of	 Indore	were	his
property.	And	Indore	is	the	next	most	beautiful	and	rich	place	to	Bombay.
He	said,	"You	are	asking	a	strange	question.	Nobody	ever	asked	me."
I	 had	 asked	 him,	 "Why	 are	 you	 still	 creating	 new	 industries,	 creating	 new
palaces?	And	you	are	becoming	old.	How	is	all	 this	going	to	be	of	any	help	at
the	time	of	death?"
He	 said,	 "I	 know,	 everything	 will	 remain	 here	 and	 I	 will	 be	 gone.	 But	 just	 a
desire	to	be	the	most	successful,	rich	man	in	the	country	keeps	driving	me.	For
no	other	reason,	just	that	everything	I	have	must	be	the	best."
He	has	the	only	Rolls	Royce	in	the	whole	world	made	of	solid	gold.	It	was	never
driven,	it	was	just	for	show,	standing	in	front	of	his	beautiful	palace.	He	has	the
best	horses	in	the	world	that	you	can	imagine.	I	have	never	seen	such	beautiful
horses.	 He	 had	 a	whole	 palace	 filled	with	 all	 kinds	 of	 exotic	 things.	 And	 the
reason	was	 that	 he	wanted	 to	 be	 the	 only	 owner	 of	 a	 certain	 thing.	 It	was	 his
absolute	 condition:	 whenever	 he	 purchases	 a	 thing,	 that	 thing	 should	 not	 be
produced	 again;	 he	 should	 be	 the	 only	 owner.	 And	 he	 was	 ready	 to	 pay	 any
money	for	it.
His	only	desire	was	--	because	Indore	in	those	days	was	a	state	--	to	purchase	all
the	houses	in	the	state,	even	the	palace	of	the	king.	And	he	almost	succeeded	--
seventy-five	percent	of	the	houses	of	Indore	belonged	to	him.	Even	the	king	had
to	borrow	money	from	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
29
Chapter	3	-	Seek	nothing	outside
him,	and	he	was	giving	to	him	very	generously	in	order	to	finally	settle	that	the
whole	of	Indore	..."He	may	be	the	king	but	it	is	my	property."
I	asked	him,	"What	will	it	do	to	you?	What	peace	will	it	bring?	You	are	always
anxious,	 tense,	 coming	 to	 the	 hospital,	 asking	 the	 psychiatrist	 about	 your
troubles.	These	houses	cannot	solve	your	troubles	and	this	money	cannot	solve
your	troubles."
And	finally	a	time	came	when	he	captured	all	the	gold	of	India,	he	became	the
gold	 king	 of	 India.	 He	 purchased	 all	 the	 gold,	 wherever	 it	 was	 possible.	 And
once	you	have	all	 the	gold	 in	your	hands,	you	have	 the	whole	country	 in	your
hands.	If	you	start	selling	it,	the	prices	will	go	down.	He	kept	the	whole	market
dependent	on	him	just	because	he	was	holding	the	gold.
And	I	asked	him,	"What	enjoyment	are	you	getting	out	of	it?"
He	said,	"I	don't	know,	just	there	is	a	tremendous	desire	to	be	the	richest,	to	be
the	most	powerful."
The	 inward	 journey	 begins	 only	when	 you	 understand	 it	 clearly	 that	 anything
outside	is	not	going	to	give	you	contentment.

that	is	the	problem.	Because	Maitreya	won't	listen	to	anybody,	he	will	have	to	be
dragged	out.	And	once	 in	 a	while	he	comes,	 still	 knocks	on	doors	 in	Lao	Tzu
House.	 For	 a	 few	 days	 Anando	 was	 very	 much	 terrified	 because	 he	 was
knocking	on	her	door	every	night.	He	used	to	be	her	neighbor.
He	is	being	missed	tremendously,	but	anyway	he	is	here	in	the	trees,	in	the	air.

HE	IS	HERE,	THERE,	EVERYWHERE	--

Question	1
A	question	by	Maneesha:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
WHEN	YOU	TALK	ABOUT	NIRVANA,	OR	ANYTHING	ELSE	THAT	OUR
MINDS
DO	NOT	KNOW,	IT	IS	EASY	ENOUGH	TO	LISTEN	WITHOUT	THE	MIND
--	JUST
ALLOWING	 YOUR	 WORDS	 TO	 FILTER	 THROUGH	 OUR
CONSCIOUSNESS,	TO	USE
YOUR	WORDS	TO	MEDITATE.	HOWEVER,	WHEN	YOU	SPEAK	ON	AN
ISSUE	THAT
MIGHT	AFFECT	OUR	DAILY	LIFE,	 IT	 IS	MORE	DIFFICULT	TO	LISTEN
WITHOUT
ENGAGING	THE	MIND.
FOR	 EXAMPLE,	 APPARENTLY,	 THE	 OTHER	 NIGHT	 SOME	 OF	 US
HEARD	YOU
ENDORSE	DRUGS;	SOME	OF	US	HEARD	YOU	SAY	THEY	WERE	OF	NO
HELP	FOR
SEEKERS.
IF	 WE	 USE	 OUR	 MIND	 AT	 ALL	 IN	 LISTENING	 TO	 YOU,	 HAVE	 WE
MISSED	THE
POINT	OF	SITTING	HERE?
Maneesha,	your	question	is	significant	because	it	may	be	the	question	of	many,
and	 it	 arises	 because	 you	 are	 not	 listening.	 What	 I	 said	 the	 other	 night	 was
neither	that	I	want	any	kind	of	drugs,	nor	that	I	don't	want	them.	What	I	said	was
a	third	thing:	I	said	that	for	centuries	humanity	has	struggled	to	stop	drugs,	but
has	failed.	The	only	way	to	get	rid	of	drugs	is	to	purify	drugs.	And	it	is	possible
because	they	are	chemical	--	we	can	change	their	composition.	And	we	can	make
them	 so	 useful	 that	 they	 don't	 destroy	 or	 harm	 anybody,	 but	 just	 give	 him	 a
restful,	peaceful	moment	to	look	beyond	his	ordinary	life.	That	may	help	him	to
inquire	more	deeply,	that	small	incident	may	become	a	search	for	meditation.
Unless	drugs	can	be	used	as	a	 step	 towards	meditation	 they	are	dangerous.	As
they	 are	 today	 they	 are	 all	 dangerous,	 and	 no	 government	 has	 been	 able	 to
prevent	 them.	 All	 kinds	 of	 measures	 ...	 millions	 of	 people	 are	 in	 jail	 --
particularly	young	people,	who	have	been	utterly	destroyed	by	those	drugs.	And
a	simple	solution	...	I	have	always	wondered	why	the	people	who	are	in	power
always	go	for	something	that	is	impossible	and	don't	try	that	which	is	very	Osho
-	The	Language	of	Existence
31
Chapter	3	-	Seek	nothing	outside
simple.	 The	 simplest	 thing	 is	 that	 no	 factories	 should	 produce	 any	 drug	 that
destroys	 anything	 in	 people's	 minds.	 The	 drug	 should	 be	 a	 nourishment	 and
creative	of	an	urge	towards	meditation.	But	nobody	has	even	proposed	that.
The	situation	is	the	same	with	all	our	difficulties.	Those	who	are	in	power	are	in
power	only	because	most	of	the	humanity	is	sick.	Either	they	are	sick	because	of
undernourishment,	or	 they	are	 sick	because	of	wrong	nourishment.	Either	 they
are	 suffering	 from	 drugs,	 or	 they	 are	 suffering	 from	 anxieties	 and	 other
anguishes.
It	 seems	 the	 elite,	 the	 powerful,	 want	 people	 to	 remain	 as	 they	 are.	 Nobody
wants	that	everybody	should	become	a	buddha.	And	every	opportunity	should	be
provided	--	by	education,	by	parents,	by	neighbors	--	every	opportunity	to	help
the	person	to	meditate.
My	 understanding	 is	 that	 there	 is	 nothing	 in	 the	 world	 to	 be	 denied.	 I	 am
absolutely	in	affirmation	of	everything,	because	even	poison	can	be	used	to	cure
something.	So	nothing	has	to	be	denied,	only	you	have	to	find	how	to	use	it	in	an
affirmative	way	 so	 that	 life	 becomes	 richer.	Now,	you	 say	 a	 few	people	heard
that	I	endorse	drugs.	In	a	way,	yes;	however,	not	the	drugs	that	are	available,	but
the	drugs	that	can	be	created,	which	will	not	be	the	same	as	marijuana	or	hashish
or	LSD.	They	will	have	a	different	composition	of	chemicals,	helping	your	body
and	mind	in	all	the	possible	ways.	So	they	heard	rightly,	but	they	may	interpret	it
wrongly.
They	may	think,	"My	god,	I	have	been	thinking	Osho	is	against	drugs."	And	they
may	have	rushed	after	the	meeting,	thinking,	"Enough	of	the	buddha,	now	find
someone	who	is	selling	all	kinds	of	drugs."	But	they	misinterpreted	me,	they	did
injustice	to	me.	I	am	not	for	these	drugs.
And	you	say,	"Some	of	us	heard	you	say	they	were	of	no	use	for	seekers."	That
was	also	wrong.	As	they	are,	they	are	of	no	use	for	seekers,	they	are	hindrances.
But	it	is	in	our	hands	to	change	them.
Man	can	 reach	 to	 the	moon,	and	he	cannot	 transform	a	drug	with	 its	negative,
harmful	aspects	 to	have	 life	affirmative,	 life	enhancing	qualities.	 It	 is	 simply	a
surprise.	Nobody	is	trying	in	that	direction	just	because	the	religious	leaders	are
afraid:	if	people	become	satisfied	with	drugs,	who	is	going	to	go	to	the	church?
Who	is	going	 to	go	 to	 the	 temples?	People	will	simply	be	enjoying	drugs,	and
without	any	bad	effects	so	you	cannot	even	speak	against	them.
The	governments	will	 be	 afraid	of	 such	drugs,	 because	 soldiers	will	 be	 taking
them	and	then	you	cannot	convince	them	that	they	have	to	go	to	war.	They	will
become	so	peaceful.
They	 have	 to	 be	 kept	 in	 such	 a	 state	 that	 they	 are	 ready	 any	moment	 to	 kill
anybody.	 But	 if	 such	 drugs	 are	 available	 then	 there	will	 be	 such	 peace	 in	 the
soldiers.	The	general	may	order,
"Turn	left!"	and	nobody	will	turn	left.
I	 have	 told	 you	 the	 story	 of	 the	 professor	 in	 the	 second	 world	 war	 who	 was
enrolled	because	more	soldiers	were	needed,	and	from	every	profession.	He	was
a	professor	of	philosophy.	He	said	again	and	again,	"I	am	not	the	type	one	needs
to	become	a	soldier.	 I	am	a	professor	of	philosophy,"	but	nobody	heard	him	--
everybody	was	finding	excuses	not	to	go	to	the	front.	He	was	forced.
The	first	day	he	stood	in	line	at	the	morning	parade	and	the	orders	were	given:
"Turn	left,	turn	right.	Go	forward,	come	back."	He	remained	standing.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
32
Chapter	3	-	Seek	nothing	outside
The	general	came	to	him	and	asked,	"What	is	the	matter,	man?	Why	don't	you	do
what	you	are	told?"
He	 said,	 "What	 is	 the	 point?	 Finally	 everybody	 has	 to	 come	 here	where	 I	 am
standing.	 All	 this	 exercise	 ...	 can	 you	 tell	 me	 the	 point	 of	 it,	 where	 they	 are
going?	Because	 finally	 they	 fall	 in,	 in	 the	 line.	So	 I	 am	already	 standing	here.
Nothing	new	is	going	to	happen	out	of	this	left	and	right	--	I	am	watching."
The	general	said,	"You	are	a	very	strange	person.	Who	has	recruited	you	into	the
army?"
He	said,	"I	have	said	beforehand	that	I	am	not	 the	 type.	All	 these	 idiots	--	you
included	--	are	unnecessarily	doing	things.	I	don't	see	any	enemy	here."
So	he	was	taken	to	the	man	who	had	brought	him	--	he	was	the	manager	of	the
mess.	He	was	asked,	"What	to	do	with	this	man?	He	does	not	listen	to	the	orders;
on	 the	 contrary,	he	 argues.	And	he	 is	dangerous	because	others	 laugh,	 and	his
arguments	may	spread	around,	others	may	start	saying	the	same	things.	He	is	a
very	dangerous	person;	I	don't	want	him	in	my	regiment.	He	called	me	an	idiot
before	everybody	else.	And	in	fact	 I	cannot	refute	him,	 it	 is	 idiotic.	So	he	was
right,	but	I	cannot	have	him,	you	put	him	to	some	other	work."
The	manager	said,	"I	will	put	him	in	the	mess."
There	was	a	pile	of	peas,	and	he	told	him,	"Sit	down	and	sort	out	the	peas	--	the
bigger	ones	on	 this	 side,	and	 the	smaller	ones	on	 this	 side."	He	said,	 "At	 least
this	I	can	do."
After	one	hour	when	 the	manager	 came,	nothing	had	happened.	The	professor
was	simply	sitting	 there,	almost	meditating.	The	manager	said,	"My	god,	what
happened?	 You	 have	 not	 done	 anything,	 you	 have	 not	 even	 touched	 a	 single
pea."
He	said,	"I	am	a	man	who	never	takes	a	single	step	without	comprehending	all
the	implications."
The	manager	had	never	heard	the	word	'implications'.	He	said,	"Implications?	It
was	such	a	simple	task."
He	said,	"It	is	not	simple.	You	don't	understand	the	theory	of	relativity."
The	manager	said,	"We	don't	need	Albert	Einstein	here.	Anybody	can	do	that	--
bigger	ones	on	one	side,	smaller	ones	on	the	other	side."
The	professor	said,	"And	what	about	those	which	are	in	the	middle?	That	is	the
problem	I've	been	meditating	on	--	where	to	put	them?	They	have	no	place,	and
you	never	told	me	where	to	put	the	middle	ones.	And	this	is	a	very	complicated
problem	because	some	are	bigger,	some	are	smaller,	some	are	even	smaller,	and
some	are	even	smaller	than	that.	If	I	do	it	accurately	then	I	will	have	to	make	a
line	out	of	the	peas,	which	will	go	for	miles.	If	you	want	me	to	do	that	I	can	do
it,	but	I	don't	see	in	what	way	it	serves	the	country.
"I	thought	you	were	a	sensible	man,	but	it	seems	the	whole	company	here	is	of
idiots.	The	 first	 idiot	was	 saying,	 'Left,	 right!'	And	you	 are	 telling	me	 to	 do	 a
thing	 that	 is	 almost	 impossible.	 The	 line	will	 go	 for	miles,	 and	who	will	 take
care?	--	I	will	be	going	with	the	line.
So	without	comprehending	all	 the	 implications,	 I	 cannot	 touch	anything.	 I	had
told	you	beforehand	that	my	profession	is	philosophy."
It	 is	a	 trouble.	Either	you	hear	and	 then	 interpret	 it	wrongly,	or	you	don't	hear
and	 then	 you	 think	 that	 drugs	 cannot	 help.	 Both	 are	wrong,	 because	 both	 are
thinking	of	the	present	day	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
33
Chapter	3	-	Seek	nothing	outside
drugs.	And	I	am	saying	that	something	that	has	not	been	solved	for	centuries	and
has	disturbed	millions	of	people's	lives	...	It	is	time	that	somebody	points	out	to
the	 scientists	 and	 to	 the	 governments	 of	 the	world	 that	 they	 are	 unnecessarily
torturing	 millions	 of	 people	 in	 jails.	 The	 simple	 thing	 will	 be	 to	 change	 the
composition	of	the	drugs	and	make	the	drugs	healthier.
But	 the	 trouble	 is,	 the	 government	 is	 interested	 in	 violent	 people,	 not	 silent
people.	And	 the	 priest	 is	 interested	 in	 tense,	 anxiety	 ridden,	miserable	 people.
Otherwise,	who	is	going	to	pray	for	whom?	This	is	the	basic	reason	why	nothing
has	been	done;	otherwise	it	is	a	simple	matter,	nothing	can	be	more	simple.	And
the	same	is	the	situation	with	other	matters.
And,	Maneesha,	I	understand	that	you	can	listen	about	nirvana	or	anything	else
that	your	minds	do	not	know.	Do	you	want	me	to	talk	only	about	things	which
you	don't	know?	That	will	simply	mean	that	I	do	not	talk.	Because	in	fact	I	have
talked	 so	much	 about	 nirvana	 that	 you	 know	 about	 it	 already	 as	much	 as	 you
know	about	drugs	--	perhaps	more	about	nirvana	than	about	drugs.
And	don't	you	want	me	to	talk	about	your	practical	life?	You	simply	want	me	to
talk	about	things	you	have	nothing	to	do	with	--	just	have	an	entertainment	and
move	towards	the	canteen.
No,	I	will	talk	about	your	practical	life	and	I	will	talk	about	the	beyond	together,
because	half	is	not	possible.	If	you	only	talk	about	the	beyond	then	your	actual
life	 remains	 the	 same	and	 the	beyond	 cannot	 be	 reached;	 it	 can	never	 become
your	experience.
I	have	to	talk	about	the	beyond	so	that	slowly,	slowly	it	sinks	into	every	fiber	of
your	 being.	 And	 I	 have	 to	 talk	 about	 your	 practical	 life	 so	 that	 you	 can	 start
changing	that	according	to	your	life	beyond.	They	have	to	become	one.	But	right
now	nirvana	has	no	meaning	to	you	--
it	is	just	a	word.
People	like	to	talk	about	things	which	make	no	difference	in	their	life.	But	I	am
not	interested	in	that	kind	of	gathering.	If	you	are	not	interested	in	transforming
your	life,	you	are	wasting	your	time	here	unnecessarily.
Your	practical	life	and	your	life	beyond	are	one	single	whole;	they	both	have	to
be	discussed.	And	you	have	to	learn	not	to	interpret,	but	to	listen	clearly	to	what
I	am	saying.
Question	2
Maneesha	has	asked	another	question:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
SOMETIMES	DURING	MEDITATION	THERE	IS	THE	SENSATION	OF
CONSCIOUSNESS	 ARISING	 AND	 EXPANDING.	 IS	 THAT	 THE	 SAME
PHENOMENON
THAT	IS	INVOLVED	IN	WATCHING?
Maneesha,	 watching	 is	 the	 highest	 point.	 What	 arises	 in	 meditation	 is	 the
beginning,	it	is	just	a	dewdrop.	When	you	will	go	farther	and	farther	and	farther
and	reach	the	ocean,	then	you	will	know	the	tremendous	vastness	and	greatness
and	 grandeur	 of	watchfulness.	Meditation	 is	 only	 a	 technique;	watchfulness	 is
your	nature.
Meditation	is	a	way	to	reach	to	watchfulness.

Maggie	 Muldoon	 finally	 decides	 to	 go	 to	 see	 that	 infamous	 shrink,	 Doctor
Feelgood.
"Doc,"	 says	 Maggie,	 "my	 husband	 is	 unbearable.	 He	 drinks	 three	 bottles	 of
whiskey	a	day,	smokes	five	packs	of	cigarettes,	and	screams	at	me	all	day	and	all
night	to	'do	this!'	and	'do	that!'	He	pushes	me	around,	and	he	can't	keep	a	job."
"Well,"	says	Feelgood,	putting	down	his	notepad,	"if	he's	as	bad	as	all	that,	why
on	earth	did	you	have	fifteen	children	by	him?"
"I	was	hoping,"	replies	Maggie,	"to	lose	him	in	the	crowd."
Kowalski	 is	 brought	 to	 court	 for	 stealing	 a	 frozen	 chicken	 from	 the	 local
supermarket.
Boris	Babblebrain,	the	young	lawyer,	puts	up	an	amazing	defense	for	Kowalski
and	the	Polack	is	found	"not	guilty".
"You	 are	 discharged,"	 says	 Judge	Rumcake.	 But	Kowalski	 does	 not	move,	 he
only	looks	back,	blankly.
"The	 judge	 says	 you	 can	 go,"	 says	Babblebrain,	waving	 his	 arms	 at	Kowalski
and	the	door.
Suddenly,	Kowalski's	face	lights	up	and	he	smiles	at	the	judge.	"Thank	you,	your
honor,"
Kowalski	says.	"And	does	that	mean	I	can	keep	the	chicken?"
Polly	gets	religion	--	it	happens	in	Christianity;	a	few	people	get	religion	--	and
when	 she	 leaves	 her	 profession	 in	 a	 whorehouse	 she	 starts	 a	 new	 life	 with
Christ's	Salvation	Army.	One	night	she	is	beating	a	drum	on	a	street	corner.
"I	used	to	lay	in	the	arms	of	men!"	shouts	Polly.	"Boom!"	goes	the	drum.
"White	men!"	shouts	Polly.	"Boom!"
"Black	men!"	shouts	Polly.	"Boom!	Boom!"
"Chinamen!"	shouts	Polly.	"Boom!	Boom!	Boom!"
"I	 used	 to	 lay	 in	 the	 arms	 of	 the	 devil	 himself!"	 she	 shouts.	 "Boom!	 Boom!
Boom!	Boom!"
"That's	 right,	 sister.	 Hallelujah!"	 comes	 a	 voice	 from	 the	 back	 of	 the	 crowd.
"Screw	them	all!"
But	 this	 is	 a	 common	 phenomenon,	 when	 people	 get	 religion.	 It	 is	 a	 great
contribution	of	Christianity	to	the	world	--	they	get	religion	and	also	a	drum!	So
they	shout	their	sins	and	beat	the	drum	to	attract	the	attention	of	people,	so	they
also	can	have	 religion.	But	 it	 is	 such	a	stupid	 thing.	Religion	 is	not	 something
that	one	gets	--	one	has	it,	nobody	can	give	it	to	you.	It	is	your	very	being.

Be	silent.	Close	your	eyes.
Feel	your	body	to	be	completely	frozen.
Look	inwards.
This	is	the	way	to	your	innermost	being.
As	your	look	centers,
you	become	slowly	aware	of	your	real	nature.
The	real	nature	we	have	called	the	buddha.
In	this	moment	you	are	all	buddhas.
And	 this	moment	 can	be	carried	all	 around	 the	day.	Not	 as	 a	 tension,	not	 as	 a
thought,	but	just	as	a	fragrance,	as	a	remembrance,	an	undercurrent.	It	will	show
in	your	practical	life.
The	buddha	is	your	beyond.	It	will	show	in	your	actions,	 in	your	responses,	 in
everything	that	you	do	--	the	buddha	will	be	present.
And	this	is	the	greatest	experience	in	the	world,	to	have	buddha	present	twenty-
four	hours	inside	you,	like	a	burning	torch	radiating	light	all	around,	filling	you

Just	watching,	and	you	have	got	it:
the	eternity	of	it,

A	man	who	 has	 experienced	 buddha	within	 himself,	 his	whole	 life	 becomes	 a

Beyond	life-and-death
2	 September	 1988	 pm	 in	 Gautam	 the	 Buddha	 Auditorium	 OUR	 BELOVED
MASTER,
BUKKO	SAID:
THE	 WAY	 OUT	 OF	 LIFE-AND-DEATH	 IS	 NOT	 SOME	 SPECIAL
TECHNIQUE;	THE
ESSENTIAL	THING	IS	TO	SEE	THROUGH	TO	THE	ROOT	OF	LIFE-AND-
DEATH.
THAT	 ROOT	 IS	 NOT	 SOMETHING	 THAT	 FELL	 FROM	 HEAVEN	 OR
SPRANG	UP
FROM	 EARTH.	 IT	 IS	 AT	 THE	 CENTER	 OF	 THE	 FUNCTIONING	 OF
EVERY	 MAN,	 LIVING	 WITH	 HIS	 LIFE,	 DYING	 WITH	 HIS	 DEATH,
BECOMING	A	BUDDHA,	MAKING	A	PATRIARCH.	THESE	ARE	ALL	 IN
DEPENDENCE	OF	IT,	AND	ONE	WHO
GOES	 INTO	 ZEN	 HAS	 TO	 PIERCE	 AND	 BREAK	 THROUGH	 TO	 THIS
THING.
WHAT	 IS	CALLED	ZEN	SITTING	 IS	NOT	SOME	SORT	OF	OPERATION
TO	BE
PERFORMED,	 AND	 TO	 TAKE	 IT	 SO	 IS	 WRONG.	 IN	 OUR	 LINE,	 IT	 IS
SIMPLY
REALIZING	WHAT	 ONE'S	 OWN	 TRUE	 HEART	 REALLY	 IS,	 AND	 IT	 IS
NECESSARY
TO	PLEDGE	ONESELF	TO	THE	TRUE	HEART.
GOING	 INTO	 ZEN	 IS	 SEEING	 ONE'S	 ORIGINAL	 NATURE,	 AND	 THE
MAIN	THING
IS	 TO	 MAKE	 OUT	 WHAT	 ONE	 WAS	 BEFORE	 EVEN	 FATHER	 OR
MOTHER	WERE
BORN.	 FOR	 THIS,	 ONE	 MUST	 CONCENTRATE	 ONE'S	 FEELING	 AND
PURIFY	 IT,	 THEN,	 ELIMINATING	 ALL	 THAT	 WEIGHS	 ON	 ONE'S
THOUGHT	AND	FEELING,	ONE	MUST	GO	TO	GRASP	THE	SELF.
WE	ARE	SAYING	THAT	THE	SELF	SEEKS	TO	GRASP	THE	SELF,	BUT	IN
FACT	IT
IS	ALREADY	THE	SELF,	SO	WHY	SHOULD	IT	GO	TO	GRASP	THE	SELF?
IT	IS	BECAUSE	IN	THE	MASS	OF	KNOWINGS	AND	PERCEIVINGS	AND
JUDGMENTS,	THE	TRUE	SELF	IS	ALWAYS	SO	WRAPPED	UP	IN	THE
DISTINCTIONS	AND	EXCLUSIVITIES	THAT	IT	DOES	NOT	EMERGE	TO
SHOW
ITSELF	AS	IT	IS.
Maneesha,	 in	 the	 world	 of	 Zen,	 Bukko	 is	 something	 like	 George	 Gurdjieff.
When	George	Gurdjieff	for	the	first	time	said,	"You	all	don't	have	souls.	Unless
you	 achieve	 a	 crystallization	 of	 your	 being,	 you	 will	 live	 and	 die	 just	 as	 a
signature	on	the	sand;	winds	will	come	and	you	will	be	forgotten.	There	will	not
be	 left	a	single	 trace	of	you,"	 it	 shocked	 the	whole	spiritual	world,	because	all
the	religions	and	all	 the	spiritual	 traditions	at	 least	agree	on	one	 thing,	 that	 the
soul	is	immortal.	You	have	it	whether	you	know	it	or	not	and	it	can	never	die.
Death	 happens	 to	 the	 body,	 not	 to	 the	 soul.	 It	 is	 simply	 a	 separation	 from	 the
body	and	a	movement	 into	a	new	body.	But	 the	 journey	of	 the	 soul	 is	eternal:
body	to	body,	species	to	species.	Finally	it	achieves	its	nature,	matures,	and	it	is
revealed	to	it	that	it	is	the	buddha.
That	has	been	a	common	understanding	around	the	whole	world	for	centuries.

Chapter	4	-	Beyond	life-and-death
Gurdjieff	was	alive	just	fifty	years	ago.	He	made	a	point	of	it	that	not	everybody
has	a	soul,	the	soul	has	to	be	earned.	This	was	a	very	new	idea,	that	you	have	to
deserve	it.
Ordinarily	you	are	just	an	empty	bottle;	inside	there	is	nothing.	You	have	to	earn,
you	 have	 to	 be	 worthy,	 you	 have	 to	 gather	 your	 consciousness	 in	 such	 a
crystallized	way	that	it	can	pass	through	death	without	dying.
So	according	to	George	Gurdjieff,	only	a	few	people	live	eternally,	most	people
are	just	experimental.	They	are	born,	they	do	all	kinds	of	stupid	things,	and	the
final	 stupidity	 --	 they	 die.	 But	 they	 don't	 leave	 even	 a	 trace	 in	 the	 world	 of
eternity.	Only	very	few	people,	like	Gautam	Buddha,	achieve	to	the	eternal.	And
because	of	these	few	people,	the	fallacy	has	come	into	being	that	everybody	has
an	eternal	being:	Buddha	achieved	it,	Mahavira	achieved	it,	Bukko	achieved	it.
Gurdjieff's	 logic	 was,	 because	 these	 few	 have	 achieved	 it,	 people	 think
everybody	else	has	it	--	just	he	has	not	discovered	it.
Gurdjieff	was	not	ready	to	agree	on	only	discovering,	because	discovery	means
it	already	exists	--	you	have	just	to	pull	back	the	curtains.	Gurdjieff	used	a	word
never	before	used	in	spiritual	experience,	and	that	was	'crystallization'.	You	have
this	small	life	and	this	small	consciousness.	You	can	make	it	so	concentrated,	so
hard,	 like	 a	 diamond,	 that	 it	 can	 pass	 through	 fire	 without	 being	 burned.	 But
unless	you	do	it,	don't	hope.
Have	you	ever	observed	that	coal	has	the	same	chemical	elements	as	a	diamond?
There	 is	 no	 chemical	 difference	 between	 diamonds	 and	 coal,	 but	 coal	 has	 no
value.	What	has	happened	to	the	diamond?	How	has	it	become	the	diamond?	A
piece	 of	 coal,	 for	 millions	 of	 years,	 under	 tremendous	 pressure,	 becomes
crystallized,	and	because	the	heat	has	been	tremendous,	now	no	fire	can	burn	it.
It	 is	 the	 hardest	 thing	 in	 the	 world.	 Crystallization	 means	 a	 coal	 becoming	 a
diamond.
I	 am	 prefacing	 Bukko's	 statement	 with	 Gurdjieff.	 Perhaps	 Gurdjieff	 was	 not
aware	of	Bukko	at	all.	He	traveled	in	India,	he	traveled	up	to	Tibet,	but	he	never
went	to	Japan	or	China.	He	gathered	from	Mohammedan	mystics,	Hindu	mystics
and	Tibetan	mystics	many	secrets	of	crystallization.	I	don't	think	he	even	heard
the	 name	 of	 Bukko;	 otherwise	 he	 would	 have	 found	 at	 least	 one	 person	 who
agrees	 with	 him.	 Bukko's	 idea	 is	 also	 the	 same.	 The	 terminology	 is	 almost
similar	but	being	in	a	Buddhist	world	he	uses	different	words.	But	the	sense	and
the	fragrance	can	be	caught	by	anyone	who	is	acquainted	with	Gurdjieff.
I	 would	 like	 you	 to	 understand	 Bukko	 as	 a	 predecessor	 of	 George	 Gurdjieff;
George	Gurdjieff	is	not	alone.	And	they	have	a	point.	I	don't	agree	with	either	of
them	but	I	certainly	appreciate	their	idea	--	their	idea	is	a	device.	To	say	to	you
that,	"You	are	just	empty,	without	any	soul,	unless	you	earn	it,"	is	very	necessary
for	sleeping	people,	for	unconscious	people,	for	their	awakening.	Even	if	you	are
fast	asleep	and	the	idea	suddenly	occurs	to	you	that	"I	am	empty,"	you	will	jump
out	of	the	bed	and	try	to	look:	What	is	the	meaning	of	my	life?	Who	am	I?
I	have	told	you	Mulla	Nasruddin's	famous	anecdote	...	He	had	come	to	Kaaba	for
a	great	fair	that	happens	every	year	--	millions	of	Mohammedans	go	to	the	stone
of	Kaaba	 to	worship	 it.	 There	was	 so	much	 crowd;	 every	 caravanserai,	 every
hotel,	every	possible	place	was	completely	filled.	He	went	around	...	 finally	he
collapsed	before	a	hotel	manager.
He	said,	"I	will	die.	The	whole	day	I	have	been	searching	for	somewhere	to	stay
and	 I	 have	 not	 been	 able	 to	 find	 a	 place.	You	have	 to	 help	me;	 otherwise	my
death	will	be	on	your	head."
The	manager	 said,	 "It	 is	very	difficult.	Every	 room	 is	 full,	 just	 ...	 I	 am	a	 little
concerned	but	I	will	tell	you	one	thing.	One	room	has	two	beds,	and	one	bed	is
unoccupied.	The	other	fellow	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
39
Chapter	4	-	Beyond	life-and-death
is	 fast	 asleep,	 so	 if	 you	 can	 silently	 go	 to	 sleep	 without	 disturbing	 the	 other
fellow	--	because	it	is	against	the	laws	of	the	hotel	--	I	can	allow	you.	And	in	the
early	morning	you	will	have	to	leave."
He	said,	"I	am	absolutely	willing."	Feeling	a	great	relief,	he	went	into	the	room.
But	Mulla	was	Mulla	 --	 his	 nature	 ...	He	 could	 not	 resist	 to	 say	 at	 least	 good
night	to	the	other	fellow.
The	other	fellow	was	dead.	That's	why	the	manager	had	said,	"Silently	you	go	to
sleep	--
don't	 disturb	 the	 other	 fellow.	He	 is	 fast	 asleep."	But	when	 he	 did	 not	 answer
good	night,	Mulla	pushed	him	from	this	side	and	 that	side,	and	finally	 tried	 to
open	his	eyes.	And	when	he	saw	that	that	man	was	dead,	he	freaked	out.
The	whole	hotel	gathered	and	the	manager	said,	"I	was	afraid	of	this	--	and	you
did	this.
What	was	 the	 need	 for	 you?	You	 had	 a	 bed,	 you	 simply	 should	 have	 gone	 to
sleep.	What	were	you	doing	with	that	fellow?	He	is	fast	asleep."
Mulla	said,	"Fast	asleep?	My	God,	I	cannot	sleep	in	this	room.	He	is	dead!"
But	the	manager	was	a	mystic,	and	he	said,	"You	only	think	that	you	are	alive.
He	also	thinks	he	is	alive.	I	have	tried	the	whole	day	to	persuade	him	that	'You
are	not	alive,'	but	he	does	not	listen.	Now,	you	think	you	are	alive	--	do	you	have
any	proof	that	you	are	alive?"
Mulla	said,	"Never	in	my	life	has	anybody	asked	for	proof	of	my	life,	and	I	don't
know	whether	really	I	am	alive	or	just	fast	asleep	like	that	fellow,	only	speaking
in	sleep.	Many	people	speak	in	sleep,	have	great	dialogues."
According	to	George	Gurdjieff,	this	is	your	situation.	You	sleep,	you	wake	up	in
the	morning,	you	do	everything	according	to	a	routine,	but	is	there	really	a	soul
in	you?	Do	you	think	you	will	be	able	to	pass	through	the	funeral	pyre?	Is	there
anything	in	you	that	you	have	touched,	felt,	experienced,	that	will	not	be	burned?
Perhaps	you	have	never	thought	about	it.	You	have	simply	believed	the	idea	of
all	religions	that	everybody	has	a	soul,	an	immortal	soul.	It	is	a	good	idea,	that
you	will	 be	 here	 always,	 enjoying	 different	ways	 of	 being:	 sometimes	 a	 tiger,
and	sometimes	an	elephant,	and	sometimes	a	man	--	but	you	will	be	here.	That
idea	 has	 gone	 so	 deep	 in	 man's	 mind	 that	 he	 does	 not	 feel	 the	 necessity	 to
discover	it;	there	is	no	need.
To	 create	 the	 need	Gurdjieff	 and	Bukko	both	 insisted	 that	 as	 you	 are,	 you	 are
really	empty.
You	 can	 be	 filled	 with	 fulfillment	 and	 contentment,	 with	 tremendous	 joy	 and
celebration,	but	you	will	have	to	do	something.
BUKKO	SAID:
THE	 WAY	 OUT	 OF	 LIFE-AND-DEATH	 IS	 NOT	 SOME	 SPECIAL
TECHNIQUE.
To	go	beyond	life-and-death	there	is	no	certain	technique.	The	essential	thing	is
to	see	through	to	the	root	of	life-and-death.	Do	you	know	you	have	roots?	You
know	 perfectly	 well	 any	 tree	 uprooted	 is	 going	 to	 die.	 Roots	 are	 hidden
underneath	the	ground.	Just	because	you	don't	have	roots	in	the	ground,	because
you	walk	here	and	there	...
Have	you	heard	about	trees	in	Africa	which	walk?	Not	very	fast,	no	traffic	rule	is
needed,	 but	 they	 go	 on	 moving	 towards	 the	 sources	 where	 more	 water	 is
available.	What	will	you	say
--	their	roots	are	their	legs?	Nothing	can	exist	without	roots.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
40
Chapter	4	-	Beyond	life-and-death
In	the	same	part	of	Africa	where	trees	move	--	sometimes	miles	from	their	place
--	another	kind	of	tree	also	exists:	the	cannibal	tree.	It	has	big	leaves	and	a	very
intoxicating	fragrance	so	that	any	bird	that	comes	close	is	bound	to	have	a	little
desire	to	experience	it.	And	the	flower	is	so	full	of	juice	that	it	is	irresistible.	It
has	 not	 yet	 been	 heard	 of	 that	 any	 bird	 has	 renounced	 and	 passed	 beyond	 the
tree;	no	bird	can	do	that.	The	bird	simply	sits	on	the	flower,	drinking.
While	the	bird	is	drinking	the	juice,	the	flower	closes	and	crushes	the	bird.
Rather	than	the	bird	drinking	the	tree,	the	tree	drinks	the	bird.	And	as	the	bird	is
completely	 squeezed	 out,	 the	 flower	 opens	 again,	 throwing	 the	 dead	 body
outside,	 waiting	 for	 somebody	 else.	 Its	 flowers	 are	 very	 big	 --	 even	 a	 human
being	can	be	caught	in	them	--	and	very	strong,	very	muscular.
It	 has	 eaten	 a	 few	human	beings!	Ordinarily	 it	 does	not	 happen	because	 those
flowers	open	too	high	up	...	unless	some	fellow	like	Mulla	Nasruddin	climbs	the
tree	and	tries	to	look	inside	the	flower	--	what	is	happening	there?	But	it	will	eat
birds	of	any	kind,	any	size.	Once	in	a	while	if	some	accident	happens	--	perhaps
in	a	high	wind	the	tree	has	fallen	and	a	man	is	passing	by	...	You	cannot	go	away
without	having	a	closer	look,	because	so	much	fragrance	you	have	never	smelt,
and	it	is	so	intoxicating,	alcoholic.	When	you	come	close	the	flower	gives	you	a
good	hug,	but	then	you	cannot	get	out	of	the	hug.	He	sucks	all	your	blood	and
leaves	you	just	as	an	empty	shell.	Have	you	ever	thought	that	you	are	an	empty
shell?
But	Bukko	and	Gurdjieff	both	 insist	 ...	 although	 they	know	everybody	has	 the
potentiality	of	becoming	a	buddha.	But	that	does	not	mean	that	you	can	simply
remain	 believing	 it.	 You	 have	 to	 be	 awakened,	 and	 you	 cannot	 be	 awakened
unless	 you	 are	 really	 shocked.	 This	 is	 their	 way	 of	 shocking	 people	 into
awakening.
Once	you	start	looking	inwards,	you	will	find	your	roots.	Those	roots	are	not	in
the	earth	and	those	roots	are	not	in	heaven.	Those	roots	are	in	your	own	being,
connected	with	the	universal	being.	Neither	can	you	see	your	own	being,	nor	can
you	see	 the	universal	being.	But	once	you	feel	your	roots,	you	have	come	to	a
place	from	where	you	can	take	the	jump	into	the	universal	life.
Then	fire	does	not	matter.	Then	you	are	beyond	ordinary	material	 things.	Then
no	 sword	 can	 cut	 you	 and	 no	 fire	 can	 burn	 you.	Now	 there	 is	 no	 life	 and	 no
death,	but	a	totally	new	phenomenon	which	is	beyond.
The	other	ordinary	fallacy	is	that	by	being	spiritual	you	will	overcome	death.	But
you	 don't	 understand	 that	 you	 can	 overcome	 death	 only	 if	 you	 overcome	 life
also.	They	are	both	part	of	one	coin,	two	sides;	you	cannot	have	a	coin	which	has
only	 one	 side.	 The	 moment	 you	 transcend	 death,	 in	 the	 same	 moment	 you
transcend	life.	Then	what	remains?	All	that	we	know	is	our	mundane	life	...	and
then	one	day	people	are	carrying	you	towards	the	burning	ghat.	We	don't	know
anything	at	all	beyond	life-and-death.
Bukko's	approach	is:
THE	 WAY	 OUT	 OF	 LIFE-AND-DEATH	 IS	 NOT	 SOME	 SPECIAL
TECHNIQUE;	THE
ESSENTIAL	THING	IS	TO	SEE	THROUGH	TO	THE	ROOT	OF	LIFE-AND-
DEATH.
From	where	this	life	is	arising,	from	the	same	place	death	will	arise.	To	be	more
accurate,	 life	and	death	both	are	walking	 together.	They	are	 two	wings,	or	 two
legs	--	side	by	side.
Every	day	you	live,	every	day	you	die.	It	is	not	that	after	seventy	years,	one	day
suddenly	you	die.	 It	 is	 not	 possible	 so	 suddenly,	 for	 no	 reason	 --	 just	 lying	 in
your	bed	and	you	die.	And	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
41
Chapter	4	-	Beyond	life-and-death
what	have	you	been	doing	for	seventy	years?	Seventy	years'	training	of	life	ends
in	a	 single	moment?	No,	 the	more	accurate	account	 is	 that	you	 start	dying	 the
day	you	are	born.
Every	 day	 you	 are	 living	 and	 dying,	 living	 and	 dying;	 both	 processes	 are
together.	At	a	certain	point	in	the	journey	--	seventy	years,	eighty	years,	ninety
years	--	the	energy	that	was	carrying	you	is	finished.	The	roots	no	longer	support
you,	 the	roots	no	longer	nourish	you;	you	shrink,	you	close	your	eyes	and	you
die.
All	the	meditations	are	in	fact	in	the	search	for	the	roots	from	where	the	life	has
arisen	and	to	where	the	life	goes	back	--	to	where?	If	we	can	find	the	roots,	we
can	find	from	where	it	is	getting	its	nourishment.	And	to	know	the	universal	life
as	your	nourishment,	you	have	gone	beyond	life-and-death.	This	is	the	authentic
Zen	experience.
THAT	 ROOT	 IS	 NOT	 SOMETHING	 THAT	 FELL	 FROM	 HEAVEN	 OR
SPRANG	UP
FROM	 EARTH.	 IT	 IS	 AT	 THE	 CENTER	 OF	 THE	 FUNCTIONING	 OF
EVERY	 MAN,	 LIVING	 WITH	 HIS	 LIFE,	 DYING	 WITH	 HIS	 DEATH,
BECOMING	A	BUDDHA,	MAKING	A	PATRIARCH.
Whatever	you	do,	at	the	center	of	your	being	is	the	root	that	is	connecting	you
with	the	universal	life	source.
THESE	ARE	ALL	IN	DEPENDENCE	OF	IT,	AND	ONE	WHO	GOES	INTO
ZEN	HAS
TO	PIERCE	AND	BREAK	THROUGH	THIS	THING.
WHAT	 IS	CALLED	ZEN	SITTING	 IS	NOT	SOME	SORT	OF	OPERATION
TO	BE
PERFORMED,	 AND	 TO	 TAKE	 IT	 SO	 IS	 WRONG.	 IN	 OUR	 LINE,	 IT	 IS
SIMPLY
REALIZING	WHAT	 ONE'S	 OWN	 TRUE	 HEART	 REALLY	 IS,	 AND	 IT	 IS
NECESSARY
TO	PLEDGE	ONESELF	TO	THE	TRUE	HEART.
GOING	 INTO	 ZEN	 IS	 SEEING	 ONE'S	 ORIGINAL	 NATURE,	 AND	 THE
MAIN	THING
IS	 TO	 MAKE	 OUT	 WHAT	 ONE	 WAS	 BEFORE	 EVEN	 FATHER	 OR
MOTHER	WERE
BORN.	 FOR	 THIS	 ONE	 MUST	 CONCENTRATE	 ONE'S	 FEELING	 AND
PURIFY	 IT,	 THEN,	 ELIMINATING	 ALL	 THAT	 WEIGHS	 ON	 ONE'S
THOUGHT	AND	FEELING,	ONE	MUST	GO	TO	GRASP	THE	SELF.
WE	ARE	SAYING	THAT	THE	SELF	SEEKS	TO	GRASP	THE	SELF,	BUT	IN
FACT	IT
IS	ALREADY	THE	SELF,	SO	WHY	SHOULD	IT	GO	TO	GRASP	THE	SELF?
IT	IS	BECAUSE	IN	THE	MASS	OF	KNOWINGS	AND	PERCEIVINGS	AND
JUDGMENTS,	THE	TRUE	SELF	IS	ALWAYS	SO	WRAPPED	UP	IN	THE
DISTINCTIONS	AND	EXCLUSIVITIES	THAT	IT	DOES	NOT	EMERGE	TO
SHOW
ITSELF	AS	IT	IS.
Bukko's	way	 is	 very	 special	 in	 the	 lineage	 of	Zen	masters.	He	 ends	 up	 in	 the
same	place	but	he	follows	a	very	different	route.
He	 is	 saying:	 first	 you	 have	 to	 encounter	 your	 heart,	 the	 very	 center	 of	 your
being.	And	as	you	encounter	 it,	hold	on	 to	 it.	The	holding	of	your	own	self	 is
necessary	 because	 so	many	 judgments,	 imaginations,	 theories,	 rationalizations
have	been	forced	upon	you.	They	drag	you	away	from	yourself;	otherwise	every
child	is	born	with	a	pure	self.	Just	turning	his	eyes	in,	he	will	encounter	himself,
there	 is	 no	 need	 to	 grab.	 But	 for	 you,	 you	 are	 lost	 in	 a	 crowd	 of	 many
conceptions,	many	ideas	about	the	self	--	what	it	is,	how	it	functions,	whether	it
is	or	not.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
42
Chapter	4	-	Beyond	life-and-death
So	the	first	thing	is	to	find	the	center	of	your	functionings.	One	thing	is	certain,
that	 you	 are	 functioning:	 speaking,	 talking,	 walking,	 breathing.	 One	 thing	 is
certain	--	you	are	functioning,	so	we	are	not	moving	from	any	theoretical	point.
That	is	the	contribution	of	Bukko	and	Gurdjieff	both:	they	always	move	from	a
real	point,	not	a	point	of	belief.	The	only	thing	that	you	know	about	is	that	you
are	a	functioning	mechanism.	Your	mind	thinks,	your	heart	falls	in	love,	you	feel
hungry,	you	drink	water	when	you	feel	thirsty.	All	that	you	know	about	you	is	so
many	functions.	These	are	not	theorizations;	it	is	not	a	question	of	being	a	Hindu
or	 being	 a	 Mohammedan.	 When	 you	 are	 thirsty,	 whoever	 you	 are,	 water	 is
needed	to	quench	the	thirst.	You	cannot	say,	"I	am	a	Catholic	--	how	can	water
quench	my	thirst	if	it	is	quenching	the	thirst	of	the	Protestant?"
The	actual	functioning	should	be	your	starting	point.	Then	just	look	inwards	to
find	 the	 center	 --	 from	 where	 these	 functions	 are	 arising.	 From	 where	 you
become	hungry,	from	where	arises	the	thirst.	Where	is	the	point	from	where	the
breathing	 arises?	 Just	 choose	 these	 functions,	 any	 function.	 For	 example,
Buddha	has	chosen	breathing;	it	is	one	of	the	functions.
From	 where	 does	 it	 arise?	 When	 you	 breathe,	 just	 watch.	 But	 breathe	 fully,
because	nobody	breathes	fully.
You	will	be	surprised	that	our	breathing	reaches	only	to	thirty	percent.	Seventy
percent	of	our	 lungs	are	full	of	carbon	dioxide;	 they	never	breathe.	Only	when
you	 are	 running	 or	 doing	 some	 gymnastics	 do	 you	 start	 breathing	 more.	 To
breathe	 one	 hundred	 percent	 without	 running,	 just	 sitting	 and	 taking	 in	 the
breath,	 in	 silence,	 to	 its	 deepest	 source,	 you	 will	 find	 the	 roots	 not	 only	 of
breathing,	but	of	hunger,	of	thirst,	of	intelligence,	of	everything.
When	 I	 say	 "Go	 to	 the	 center"	 that's	 what	 I	 mean.	 Every	 day	 we	 "go	 in"	 in
meditation.
People	 think	 that	 just	 by	 closing	 the	 eyes	 you	 are	 in.	 If	 you	 were	 just-born,
certainly	you	would	be	in.	But	there	is	so	much	garbage,	so	many	scriptures	and
so	many	scholars	standing	in	between	you	and	your	real	self	that	before	you	go
anywhere	they	will	say,	"Where	are	you	going?	I	have	the	answer.	There	 is	no
need	to	torture	yourself.	Just	say,	 'I	am	the	immortal	self'	and	you	will	be	back
home.	Why	bother	unnecessarily?	Aham	brahmasmi	--	I	am	the	ultimate."
I	have	asked	many	Hindu	sannyasins,	"Have	you	really	experienced	it	 --	aham
brahmasmi
--	or	 just	 read	 it	 in	a	scripture?"	 If	 they	are	alone,	without	 their	disciples,	 they
will	say,	"To	be	true,	we	have	not	reached	to	that	point	yet,	but	someday	we	will
reach.	At	 least	we	 have	 understood	 the	 scripture."	 It	 is	 just	 scripture.	 It	 is	 not
your	experience.	All	religions	have	managed	to	turn	humanity	into	parrots.
A	bishop	used	to	have	a	parrot	--	a	very	unique	specimen.	He	used	to	give	the
whole	Sermon	on	the	Mount.	And	everybody	was	surprised	about	his	authority,
accuracy.	 The	 parrot	 died	 and	 the	 bishop	was	 very	 sad.	He	went	 to	 every	 pet
shop,	and	finally	at	one	shop	the	man	said,	"I	have	the	right	parrot	for	you,	come
within.	It	is	very	special."	The	parrot	was	very	beautiful,	and	the	man	described
him:	"Do	you	see	around	one	of	the	legs	of	the	parrot	a	small	thread,	and	around
the	other	leg	another	small	thread?"
The	bishop	looked	and	he	said,	"Yes."
He	said,	"If	you	pull	one	thread	he	will	immediately	give	you	the	Sermon	on	the
Mount."
The	bishop	said,	"That's	what	I	have	been	looking	for.	And	what	about	the	other
leg?"
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
43
Chapter	4	-	Beyond	life-and-death
He	said,	"If	you	pull	the	other	leg	he	will	give	you	a	lecture	on	the	Koran.	He	has
been	 trained	 for	 both	 religions,	 so	 anybody	 can	 purchase	 him,	 either	 a
Mohammedan	or	a	Christian."
The	bishop	said,	"This	is	even	better	--	just	for	a	change	..."	But	the	bishop	said,
"I	have	an	inquiry.	If	I	pull	both	threads	together,	what	will	happen?"
The	parrot	said,	"You	idiot!	I	will	fall	flat	on	the	ground.	What	will	happen?	This
way	you	must	have	killed	your	last	parrot.	I	refuse	to	go	with	this	man."
The	owner	of	 the	pet	shop	said,	"You	have	disturbed	my	parrot	 --	he	 is	a	very
intelligent	person,	and	you	asked	such	an	unintelligent	question.	If	you	pull	both
legs,	obviously	he	will	fall."
All	 the	 religions	 have	 converted	 everybody	 into	 a	 parrot.	 And	 people	 are
perfectly	satisfied	with	being	parrots;	it	is	so	easy,	so	simple.	But	the	experience
needs	tremendous	energy	to	inquire,	a	great	love	to	find	out	who	you	are,	where
are	your	roots.
Our	effort	here	 is	not	 to	create	parrots.	That	 is	being	done	 in	every	church,	 in
every	synagogue,	in	every	temple,	in	every	mosque.	Our	effort	is	to	bring	you	to
your	 own	 roots,	 because	 from	 those	 roots,	 slowly	 slowly	 you	 can	 sink	 deeper
into	the	universal,	into	the	ultimate.	There	is	no	other	way.
It	 is	not	a	 technique,	 it	 is	simply	grabbing	your	original	roots,	from	where	you
are	coming.
Naturally	you	have	to	dig	deep	--	and	without	any	fear	because	nothing	can	be
taken	from	you.
The	 day	 you	were	 born	 your	 destiny	was	 decided,	 that	 you	will	 die.	Between
birth	and	death,	whatever	you	do	is	of	no	meaning.
Only	one	thing	can	be	meaningful:	if	you	can	find	the	roots	of	birth	and	death.
Then	 you	 can	 sit	 silently	 like	 a	 buddha,	 in	 utter	 peace,	 with	 no	 fear,	 in	 great
ecstasy.

Issa	wrote,	on	the	death	of	his	child:
THIS	DEWDROP	WORLD	--
IT	MAY	BE	A	DEWDROP,
AND	YET	...	AND	YET	...
He	loved	his	child	very	much	--	 the	mother	had	died.	He	loved	his	small	child
and	 that	 child	 also	 died.	On	his	 death	 he	wrote	 this	 small	 haiku	 ...	 not	 saying
much,	still	it	says	much.
THIS	DEWDROP	WORLD	--	IT	MAY	BE	A	DEWDROP.
Agreed,	it	is	a	dewdrop	--	and	particularly	this	small	child.
AND	YET	...	AND	YET	...
Yet	a	love	arises.	Yet	one	feels	for	it.
Zen	is	not	against	the	world.	On	the	contrary,	it	makes	your	dewdrop	love	into	an
oceanic	love.	It	is	absolutely	for	reality	--	it	is	not	an	escape.	It	is	a	tremendous
indulgence	into	the	very	roots	of	your	being.	And	the	man	who	knows	his	roots,
only	 he	 lives.	 Others	 only	 pretend;	 others	 are	 simply	 actors	 acting	 somebody
else's	role.
A	 man	 who	 is	 original	 is	 not	 acting	 anybody's	 role,	 he	 is	 himself.	 And	 his
authority	does	not	come	from	anybody,	it	comes	from	the	universe	itself.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
I	 AM	 SERIOUSLY	 CONCERNED:	 LAST	 NIGHT	 WHEN	 YOU	 WERE
SPEAKING	OF
THE	 SENSES,	 AS	 TRADITIONALLY	 CLASSIFIED,	 YOU	 DID	 NOT
MENTION	THE
EIGHTH	SENSE,	THE	SENSE	OF	HUMOR.	WHAT	HAPPENED?
I	thought	you	would	understand	it	without	saying.	All	that	we	are	doing	here	is
practicing	the	sense	of	humor	--	that's	why	I	left	it	out	of	the	count.	But	if	you
want,	 it	can	be	counted	in,	because	certainly	only	man	has	the	sense	of	humor.
No	buffalo	laughs	--	and	if	you	find	a	buffalo	laughing	you	will	run	so	fast.	You
will	lose	all	control	over	yourself	if	suddenly	your	horse	starts	laughing!
The	whole	world	 is	 silent	 as	 far	 as	 laughter	 is	 concerned	 --	 only	man	 laughs.
Man	 can	 laugh	 because	 he	 has	 a	 small	 consciousness.	 As	 the	 consciousness
grows	deeper,	his	humor	also	becomes	deeper.	At	the	ultimate	peak,	everything
becomes	a	hilarious	festival,	a	carnival.
Something	about	the	sense	of	humor	...
Captain	Kurtski,	the	pilot,	turns	on	the	public	address	system.
"We	will	be	landing	at	Moscow	airport	in	three	hours'	time.	We	hope	you	have

Then,	forgetting	to	turn	off	the	loudspeaker,	he	turns	to	co-pilot	Cliffski.
"Take	over,	Cliffski,"	 says	Kurtski,	 his	 voice	 booming	 through	 the	 plane.	 "I'm
going	for	a	cup	of	coffee,	and	then	I'm	going	to	take	that	new	stewardess,	Gertie,
and	give	her	all	my	hot	Polish	machinery."
Gertie,	 the	 stewardess,	 hears	 this	 in	 the	 main	 cabin	 of	 the	 plane.	 She	 dashes
towards	the	cockpit	 to	tell	Kurtski	to	shut	up.	On	the	way,	she	trips	and	nearly
falls	over,	next	to	a	little	old	lady.
"Don't	 be	 in	 such	 a	 hurry,	 dearie,"	 says	 the	 little	 old	 lady.	 "Let	 him	 finish	 his
coffee	at	least."
Paddy	is	feeling	sad	as	he	orders	his	tenth	beer	at	the	Loony	Licker	Pub.
"What's	wrong,	Paddy?"	asks	Igor,	the	bartender.
"I	lost	my	dog,"	sobs	Paddy.
"Why	don't	you	put	an	advertisement	in	the	newspaper?"	suggests	Igor.
"It	is	no	good,"	moans	Paddy.	"My	dog	can't	read."
Old	lady	Gilda	runs	the	town	drugstore	with	her	sister,	Maggie.	One	day,	a	large
stranger	comes	to	town	and	is	feeling	very	horny.	But	the	town	is	very	quiet,	and
he	 cannot	 find	 anyone	 to	 help	 him	 relieve	 his	 hormonal	 harassment.	 So	 he
decides	to	go	to	the	pharmacy	to	get	something	to	take	for	it.	When	he	walks	in
he	sees	old	lady	Gilda	at	the	counter.
"Excuse	me,"	says	the	stranger,	slightly	embarrassed,	"but	I	would	like	to	see	the
boss."
"Well,"	says	Gilda,	"I	am	the	boss."
"Oh,"	stammers	the	stranger,	"then	I	would	like	to	see	a	man	clerk."
"Sorry,"	 says	Gilda	 casually,	 "we	 ain't	 got	 no	man	 clerk.	 But	 you	 can	 tell	me
what	you	want,	I	won't	be	embarrassed."
"Okay,"	says	the	stranger.	"I	have	got	an	awful	erection.	What	can	you	give	me
for	it?"
"Just	a	minute,"	says	Gilda,	and	she	goes	back	inside	the	store.
Five	minutes	later	she	returns.
"I	 have	 just	 been	 talking	 with	 my	 sister,	 Maggie,	 who	 makes	 up	 the
prescriptions,"	says	Gilda,	smiling,	"and	we	decided	the	best	we	can	give	you	is
the	whole	store	and	two	hundred	dollars."
You	get	it?
No,	 even	Sardar	Gurudayal	Singh	 is	 silent.	Late	 in	 the	night	 think	of	 it	 again.
Then	you	will	know	what	the	sense	of	humor	is.

General	Popov,	 the	Russian	officer,	 and	Field	Marshal	Dogski,	 the	Polack,	 are
discussing	courage	with	General	Peckerhead.
"Let	me	 demonstrate	 real	 courage,"	 barks	 the	 Russian	 officer.	 "Climb	 up	 that

soldier	obeys	immediately,	and	is	carried	away	by	the	medical	team.
Not	 to	be	out-done,	 the	American	general	yells,	"I'll	show	you	courage!	Climb
that	 telephone	pole	and	 jump	down	backwards,"	he	screams	at	his	soldier.	The
man	does	and	is	also	carried	away,	broken	and	battered,	by	the	medical	team.
"That's	 nothing,"	 says	 Field	 Marshal	 Dogski,	 the	 Polack.	 "Watch	 this.	 Hey,
Klopski!
Climb	that	telephone	pole,	jump	off,	do	a	double-flip,	and	land	on	your	head."
The	soldier	looks	at	the	general,	then	yells	back,	"Fuck	you,	you	stupid	bastard!"
"You	see,	gentlemen?"	replies	Dogski,	proudly.	"Now,	that	is	courage!"

Be	silent.	Close	your	eyes.
Feel	the	body	to	be	completely	frozen.
Look	inwards	...	to	the	very	roots	of	your	being.
Deeper	...	and	deeper,
as	if	you	are	digging	a	hole	in	the	earth.
To	reach	to	the	roots	is	to	discover	the	buddha	within	you,	the	eternal	principal
of	life.	A	little	more	...	a	little	more	...
Sometimes	one	returns	from	only	one	step	away	--	if	he	had	taken	one	step	more,
he	would	have	found	the	roots.	So	until	you	find	the	roots	go	on	digging	--	they
are	there.
One	 thing	 is	 absolutely	 certain,	 that	 you	 have	 roots	 in	 existence.	 It	 is	 only	 a
question	of	digging	deep	enough	to	find	them.	And	you	are	prepared	to	reach	to
the	roots	and	to	reach	the	universal	nourishment	which	is	our	eternal	life.
Only	once	you	have	 experienced	 this	 can	you	 say,	 aham	brahmasmi,	 I	 am	 the
divine.
Before	this	experience	you	are	just	an	emptiness.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence

Relax	...	let	go,	just	be	a	watcher.
The	body	is	lying	there,	the	mind	is	lying	there	...
You	are	not	the	mind,	you	are	not	the	body,
you	are	just	the	watcher.
This	watcher	 is	another	name	for	your	 roots.	This	watcher	 is	 the	original	man,
the	buddha.
Let	 it	 sink	 into	 every	 fiber	 of	 your	 being,	 drink	 it	 deeply.	 It	 is	 the	 greatest
moment	in	life	--	to	drink	the	divine.
What	a	beautiful	evening	...	so	many	drunkards,	and	such	a	great	silence	...	and
the	rain	drops	creating	a	song	of	their	own,	the	coolness	of	the	wind	making	your
experience	richer.
In	this	moment	you	are	all	one	consciousness.	It	is	no	more	a	crowd	of	people,	it
is	just	one	consciousness,
one	divine	being	pervading	all	of	you.
It	is	just	an	atmosphere,
an	ocean	in	which	you	all	have	drowned.
Nivedano	...
(Drumbeat)
Come	back	...	but	come	back	as	a	buddha.
Come	back	slowly,	peacefully,	gracefully,
collecting	the	experience	...
You	 have	 to	 carry	 this	 experience	 in	 your	 day-to-day	 life.	 Sit	 down	 for	 a	 few
moments,	remembering	that	you	are	a	buddha.	It	is	no	more	parrot	talk,	it	is	your
experience	--	you	have	been	to	the	ocean	yourself.

3	 September	 1988	 pm	 in	 Gautam	 the	 Buddha	 Auditorium	 OUR	 BELOVED
MASTER,
TOREI	SAID:
IF	YOU	WANT	TO	BE	FREE	FROM	THIS	WORLD	OF	SUFFERING,	FIRST
YOU
MUST	CONTEMPLATE	IMPERMANENCE.
THOSE	WHO	ARE	BORN	MUST	 INEVITABLY	DIE.	EVEN	THE	YOUNG
ARE	NOT
EXEMPT;	EVEN	THE	STRONG	ARE	 IN	DANGER.	 EVEN	A	LONG	LIFE
DOES	NOT
LAST	 MORE	 THAN	 EIGHTY	 YEARS	 OR	 SO.	 IF	 YOU	 DON'T
ANNIHILATE	THE
NATURE	OF	AFFLICTIONS	SOMEHOW,	AND	ARRIVE	ON	THE	PATH	OF
LIBERATION,	 EVEN	 IF	YOU	ASCEND	TO	THE	RANK	OF	 SOVEREIGN
OF	 A	 NATION,	 GREAT	 MINISTER,	 DEITY,	 SPIRIT,	 OR	 WIZARD,	 IT	 IS
STILL
EVANESCENT	AS	 LIGHTNING	AND	MORNING	DEW,	 LASTING	ONLY
FOR	A	WHILE.
WHEN	CONDITIONS	MEET,	 EVERYTHING	SURELY	SEEMS	TO	EXIST;
BUT
WHEN	THE	CONDITIONS	DISINTEGRATE	--	EMPTINESS.	THIS	BODY	IS
GAINED
THROUGH	 THE	 RELATIONSHIP	 OF	 FATHER	 AND	 MOTHER,	 AND
COMES	FROM
THEIR	 CONDITIONS.	 SOLIDITY	 BECOMES	 SKIN,	 FLESH,	 LIGAMENT,
AND	BONE;	FLUIDITY	BECOMES	SPITTLE,	TEARS,	PUS,	AND	BLOOD;
HEAT	BECOMES
WARMTH	 AND	 FLEXIBILITY;	 AIR	 BECOMES	 BREATH	 AND
MOVEMENT.
WHEN	THESE	FOUR	CONDITIONS	SUDDENLY	ARE	EXHAUSTED,	THE
BODY
GETS	COLD	AND	THE	BREATH	STOPS	--	THERE	IS	NOTHING	CALLED
"ME."	AT
THAT	 TIME	 THIS	 BODY	 IS	 REALLY	 NOT	 OUR	 OWN;	 IT	 IS	 ONLY	 A
TEMPORARY
INN.	 HOW	 CAN	 WE	 BE	 SO	 GREEDILY	 ATTACHED	 TO	 THIS
TEMPORARY	INN
THAT	WE	IGNORE	ETERNITY?
CONTEMPLATING	 THESE	 FOUR	 TRANSCENDENCES	 --
IMPERMANENCE,	 SUFFERING,	 EMPTINESS,	 SELFLESSNESS	 --
SEEKING	THE	WAY	OF
ENLIGHTENMENT	IS	CALLED,	"THE	TEACHING	OF	FOUR	REALITIES
FOR
DISCIPLES."	 THIS	 IS	 THE	 ESSENTIAL	 GATEWAY	 TO	 BEGINNING
ENTRY	INTO
THE	WAY	FOR	ALL	ENLIGHTENED	ONES.
Maneesha,	before	I	discuss	Torei's	serious	things,	I	have	to	introduce	a	few	new
animal	gods	into	Avirbhava's	Museum	of	Gods.	Before	I	call	her,	I	will	have	to
tell	you	something	about	these	gods.
"Sheep:	The	male	sheep	is	known	as	a	ram	and	has	been	a	symbol	of	numerous
gods.
Osiris	 and	Ammon-Ra	 of	Egypt	were	 both	worshipped	 as	 rams.	The	 ram	was
sacrificed	each	year	in	Egypt.	It	was	skinned	and	the	skin	placed	over	an	image
of	the	god,	recalling	the	time	when	Ammon-Ra	was	incarnated	in	the	form	of	a
ram.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
50
Chapter	5	-	The	gateway	of	the	buddhas
Apes:	 In	 ancient	 Egypt,	 apes	 were	 considered	 sacred	 and	 were	 preserved	 by
embalming	them	at	death.
Mouse:	One	of	 the	greatest	of	 the	Greek	gods,	Apollo,	was	known	 to	 take	 the
form	of	a	mouse	in	his	role	as	sender	of	the	plague.	Apollo,	the	sun	god,	would
incarnate	as	mice	and	rats	to	dispel	the	forces	of	night.
Horse:	 In	Hinduism,	 the	 tenth	 incarnation	of	Vishnu	 is	a	white	horse,	Kalki.	 It
has	 not	 yet	 happened.	 Nine	 incarnations	 have	 happened;	 the	 tenth	 is	 awaited.
The	tenth	will	be	called	Kalki.	It	will	be	a	white	horse,	who	is	to	come	to	judge
the	world	at	 the	end	of	 this	yuga,	 the	 fourth	and	 the	 last	 cycle	of	one	million,
eight	hundred	thousand	years	in	the	Hindu	concept	of	the	world.	He	will	destroy
the	wicked,	reward	the	good,	and	enable	Vishnu	to	create	a	new	world."
It	seems	the	time	for	Kalki	is	coming	near.	Beware	of	the	white	horse!
"Bull:	 In	 ancient	 Persia,	 the	 bull	 was	 worshipped	 as	 the	 god	 who	 caused	 the
grass	to	grow.
In	Greece,	the	great	god	Zeus	used	the	guise	of	a	bull	to	seduce	Europa,	hoping
thereby	that	his	animal	transformation	would	elude	his	ever-watchful	wife,	Hera,
from	detecting	his	adultery.	The	followers	of	Dionysius	would	kill	a	bull	during
midsummer	festivals	in	honor	of	the	great	god	Zeus."
This	Museum	 of	 Gods	 is	 not	 just	 a	 museum,	 it	 shows	 how	 human	mind	 has
remained	 retarded.	Rather	 than	 bringing	 consciousness	 to	 its	 heights,	man	 has
been	worshipping	all	kinds	of	animals.	Even	the	future,	the	final	incarnation	of
God	in	Hinduism,	Kalki,	is	going	to	be	a	white	horse	--	not	a	man,	not	a	buddha.
It	 shows	 the	 retardedness,	 the	 primitiveness	 of	 our	 intelligence.	 This	museum
will	 be	 a	 symbol	 to	 the	 whole	 world	 to	 remind	 them:	 "This	 is	 what	 your
forefathers	have	been	doing,	what	you	are	doing.	And	you	call	it	religion!"
Before	I	ask	Avirbhava	to	bring	her	new	acquisitions,	two	little	jokes	about	these
gods.
Late	one	night,	Satan	the	devil	and	his	partner,	Lucifer	the	monkey,	knock	on	the
door	of	Pope	the	Polack's	Vatican	apartment.	The	Polack	pope	comes	to	the	door
with	an	arm	around	his	best	friend,	Simon	the	sheep.
"Good	evening,	your	phoniness,"	says	the	devil,	grinning	cheekily	and	fondling
his	forked	tail.	"My	friend	and	I	were	wondering,	do	you	have	any	midget	nuns
in	your	apartment?"
"Certainly	not!"	snaps	back	the	pope,	trying	to	slam	the	door.
"Well	 then,	Holy	Father,"	chuckles	 the	devil,	 licking	 the	flames	of	his	 lips	and
jamming	his	pitchfork	in	the	doorway,	"do	you	have	any	midget	nuns	living	in
the	Vatican?"
"I	don't	know	of	any,"	cries	the	frightened	Pope	the	Polack.
"Perhaps,"	 giggles	Lucifer,	 the	monkey,	 swinging	 from	Satan's	 pitchfork,	 "you
know	of	any	midget	nuns	living	anywhere?"
"I	 cannot	 say,"	 shouts	Pope	 the	Polack,	 infuriated,	 "that	 I	know	of	 any	midget
nuns	 anywhere	 at	 all!"	And	he	grabs	Simon	 the	 sheep's	 crucifix,	 and	waves	 it
wildly	under	the	devil's	nose.
The	devil	picks	up	the	monkey	by	the	shoulders,	lifts	him	in	the	air,	and	shakes
him	hard.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
51
Chapter	5	-	The	gateway	of	the	buddhas
"You	see,	you	idiot!"	shouts	Satan.	"I	told	you	you	fucked	a	penguin!"
Pope	the	Polack	goes	for	a	summer	retreat	into	the	mountains	of	Italy.	He	lives
in	a	little	stone	cottage,	and	the	only	companions	he	has	are	a	flock	of	sheep.
After	a	few	days	without	any	company,	the	Polack	pope	becomes	crazy	for	sex,
and	he	chooses	one	of	the	horned	sheep	as	a	partner.
He	takes	off	his	gown	and	puts	his	machinery	into	the	sheep.	But	while	he	is	in
action	with	the	poor	animal,	it	suddenly	starts	to	run.	Pope	the	Polack,	with	his
underwear	down	around	his	ankles,	is	unable	to	do	anything	but	hold	on	to	the
sheep's	horns.
They	race	down	the	mountainside	together,	past	a	field	where	Grandma	Pickle	is
picking	daisies.	Grandma	is	a	little	short-sighted,	but	looks	up	in	amazement	as
the	sheep	and	the	Polack	pope	go	racing	past.
"My	god!"	she	mutters	 to	herself.	"No	money	to	buy	pants,	but	he	 is	driving	a
white	motorbike!"
Now,	Avirbhava,	bring	your	gods.

Now	the	serious	matter	...
Torei	is	not	a	master	but	he	is	certainly	a	great	teacher.	And	I	have	chosen	him	so
that	 you	 can	make	 a	 clear-cut	 distinction	 between	 the	 greatest	 teacher	 and	 the
smallest	master.
Even	 the	 smallest	 master,	 the	 humblest	 master,	 has	 a	 beauty,	 a	 truth,	 a
realization.	 He	may	 not	 say	 a	 single	 word,	 but	 his	 silence	 is	 a	 scripture.	 The
greatest	teacher	may	know	all	the	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
52
Chapter	5	-	The	gateway	of	the	buddhas
scriptures,	may	have	great	interpretations,	but	he	remains	a	parrot.	What	he	says
he	does	not	know;	his	saying	is	dependent	on	his	learning,	studying,	but	not	on
his	experience,	not	on	his	existential	approach	to	his	own	being.
Torei	 is	 a	 good	 example	 of	 a	 great	 teacher.	 But	 such	 teachers	 can	 deceive
humanity	--	they	have	been	deceiving,	because	they	talk	beautifully.	Their	words
are	 the	 same	 as	 the	 words	 of	 the	 masters	 --	 sometimes	 more	 refined,	 more
cultivated,	more	cultured	--	but	still	 they	are	empty.	Once	 in	a	while	 they	may
quote	a	sentence	which	has	significance;	not	because	of	them,	but	because	that
sentence	 has	 come	 from	 some	 great	 living	 master.	 They	 have	 been	 great
collectors,	but	as	far	as	their	own	reality	is	concerned	they	are	as	ignorant	as	one
can	be.

fourth,	which	is	missing	in	the	English	language,	is	dhyana,	or	Zen	in	Japanese.
Contemplation	is	the	way	of	the	philosopher.	He	thinks	it	over.	It	is	not	beyond
mind,	 it	 is	 within	 mind.	 He	 may	 be	 very	 sophisticated,	 his	 words	 may	 be
arranged	beautifully,	but	he	cannot	understand	what	meditation	 is;	he	can	only
understand	contemplation.	The	very	word
'contemplation'	means	thinking	about	higher	things.	But	if	you	don't	know	those
things,	what	can	you	think	about?
Contemplation	is	one	of	the	most	empty	words.	If	you	know,	you	know;	there	is
no	need	to	contemplate.	If	you	don't	know,	how	can	you	contemplate?	What	are
you	 going	 to	 contemplate?	What	 is	 going	 to	 be	 your	 subject	matter?	You	 are
simply	groping	in	darkness	and	calling	it	contemplation.
He	 certainly	 is	 acquainted	with	 the	 scriptures,	 very	well	 acquainted,	 but	 he	 is
committing	 the	 same	 mistake	 millions	 of	 teachers	 around	 the	 world	 have
committed.	 First:	 IF	 YOU	WANT	 TO	 BE	 FREE	 FROM	 THIS	WORLD	 OF
SUFFERING	...
Can	you	find	a	person	who	does	not	want	to	be	free	from	suffering?	There	is	no
question	about	it.	Everybody	wants	to	get	rid	of	suffering,	misery.
The	way	that	Torei
suggests	is,	FIRST	YOU	MUST	CONTEMPLATE
IMPERMANENCE.	 It	 won't	 help.	 You	 can	 think	 everything	 is	 impermanent:
birth	is	impermanent,	youth	is	impermanent,	wealth	is	impermanent;	life	itself	is
running	out.
Everything	is	impermanent.	That	does	not	mean	it	will	take	you	out	of	suffering.
It	simply	makes	you	more	aware	that	while	there	is	time,	enjoy	as	much	as	you
can,	because	time	is	passing	and	death	is	not	far	away.
Strangely	enough,	the	same	argument	is	given	by	Charvakas,	the	Indian	atheists.
They	say,
"Everything	is	fleeting,	so	don't	waste	time	in	temples,	in	rituals,	just	eat,	drink
and	be	merry.
And	 if	 you	 don't	 have	money,	 borrow	money,	 because	 after	 death	 everyone	 is
finished,	 nobody	 is	 going	 to	 ask	 for	 his	 money	 back.	 After	 death,	 in	 the
graveyard	everybody	sleeps	soundly.
The	man	who	borrowed	the	money	and	the	man	who	gave	the	money	both	are
dead.	 So	 don't	miss	 a	 single	moment.	 Enjoy	 it,	 even	 if	 it	 is	 to	 be	 enjoyed	 on
borrowed	money."
The	statement	in	Sanskrit	is	very	beautiful.	The	statement	says,	no	one	who	has
gone	beyond	death	has	ever	come	back.	This	is	enough	proof,	more	than	enough,
that	death	is	the	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
53
Chapter	5	-	The	gateway	of	the	buddhas
end.	And	if	death	is	the	end,	then	why	be	worried	about	small	things?	It	may	be
your	own	pocket	or	 somebody	else's	pocket,	 it	does	not	matter.	Death	will	not
differentiate	 between	 the	 sinner	 and	 the	 saint.	 There	 is	 no	 one	 to	 make	 the
judgment.
RINAM	 KRITVA	 GHRITAM	 PIBET.	 Even	 if	 you	 have	 to	 borrow	 money,
borrow	it,	but	drink	refined	butter.	Don't	be	worried	about	tomorrow.
It	was	a	great	school,	not	only	in	India	but	in	Greece	also.	These	were	the	two
countries	at	 that	 time	which	were	 touching	 the	peaks	of	civilization.	 In	Greece
there	 was	 a	 great	 man,	 Epicurus,	 and	 he	 still	 has	 a	 small	 following.	 But
generally,	the	whole	Western	world	is	Epicurian;	they	may	know,	they	may	not
know.
Epicurus'	whole	teaching	was	that	all	is	matter,	and	when	all	matter	disintegrates
nothing	 is	 left	 behind.	 So	 don't	 bother	 about	 any	 spirituality,	 and	 don't	 bother
about	any	other	world	--
there	 is	none.	There	has	not	been	a	single	witness.	 It	 is	certainly	a	 tremendous
argument,	 that	 there	 is	not	 a	 single	witness	of	 the	other	world,	 the	paradise.	 It
seems	to	be	all	fancy,	imagination,	wish-fulfillment.	What	you	cannot	get	here,
you	project	that	you	will	get	it	after	life.	It	gives	a	certain	consolation.
But	 what	 can	 you	 contemplate?	 Even	 if	 you	 contemplate	 that	 everything	 is
impermanent,	 that	simply	means	do	it	quick,	be	speedy,	things	are	fast	running
out	 of	 hand;	 squeeze	 the	 juice	 of	 every	moment	without	 delay.	Contemplation
can	take	you	into	an	atheistic	worldview.
THOSE	WHO	ARE	BORN	MUST	 INEVITABLY	DIE.	EVEN	THE	YOUNG
ARE	NOT
EXEMPT.
Just	because	everyone	is	going	to	die	...	Torei	and	similar	teachers	think	that	it	is
enough	for	people	 to	become	detached	because	everything	is	going	to	die.	The
result	is	just	the	contrary	--	because	everything	is	going	to	die,	be	quick	before	it
dies.
A	man	was	brought	into	a	court	in	France	for	making	love	to	a	woman	on	the	sea
beach.
The	charge	was	that	he	had	been	making	love	to	a	dead	woman.
The	magistrate	asked	him,	"What	do	you	have	to	say?"
He	said,	"I	thought	she	was	an	English	lady."
Man	has	been	told	by	these	teachers:
EVEN	THE	STRONG	ARE	IN	DANGER.	EVEN	A	LONG	LIFE	DOES	NOT
LAST
MORE	THAN	EIGHTY	YEARS	OR	SO.
The	desire	is	that	you	will	think,	"Everything	is	so	changing,	what	is	the	point	in
going	after	 it?"	That's	what	Torei	 is	 thinking.	But	he	 is	absolutely	blind	 to	 the
fact	 that	 the	 more	 people	 think	 things	 are	 going	 to	 change,	 the	 more	 they
increase	their	speed.	Why	has	humanity	been	increasing	its	speed?
I	have	heard	...	A	newly-wed	couple	is	rushing	in	a	fresh,	new	Ferrari.	The	girl
feels	afraid	because	the	car	is	going	at	one	hundred	and	fifty	miles	per	hour.	She
is	trembling,	and	she	asks	the	man,	"Please	at	least	look	at	the	map."
The	man	says,	"Who	bothers	about	the	map!	Is	it	not	enough	to	enjoy	the	speed
itself?	We	must	 reach	 somewhere,	 it	 cannot	 be	 nowhere.	 You	 can	 consult	 the
map	--	I	am	enjoying	the	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
54
Chapter	5	-	The	gateway	of	the	buddhas
speed.	 I	 don't	 have	 any	 time	 to	waste	 consulting	 the	map.	What	 is	 the	 point?
Wherever	we	reach,	we	will	find	a	hotel;	whether	its	name	is	Honeymoon	Hotel
or	not	does	not	matter."
Increasingly,	 humanity	 has	 been	 interested	 in	 speed,	more	 speed.	 Perhaps	 you
have	 not	 taken	 into	 consideration	 the	 implication.	 The	 implication	 is,	 do
everything	as	fast	and	quickly	as	you	can	because	life	is	short.	But	these	people
like	Torei	 thought	 that	 if	people	contemplate	 that	 everything	 is	going	 to	die	 ...
why	love	this	woman	if	she	is	going	to	die?	--	if	not	today	then	tomorrow	or	the
day	after	tomorrow.	Even	if	she	does	not	die,	she	will	be	in	a	worse	position	--
she	will	become	old.	What	is	the	point	in	loving	a	woman	who	will	become	old?
A	man	was	telling	a	woman,	"I	love	you.	I	love	you	more	than	my	life."
The	woman	said,	"Really?	Will	you	love	me	always	as	you	love	me	now?"
The	 man	 contemplated	 and	 he	 said,	 "There	 is	 only	 one	 problem.	 When	 you
become	old,	will	you	 look	 like	your	mother?	Then	I	withdraw	my	statement.	 I
cannot	love	your	mother	--
that	much	is	certain.	Will	you	remain	the	same?"
Nothing	remains	the	same.
From	the	point	of	change	there	are	two	roads.	One	leads	to	atheism,	materialism
--	 enjoy,	 there	 is	 nothing	 much	 to	 discover.	 The	 other	 road	 is	 that	 because
everything	 is	 impermanent,	 try	 to	 find	 something	 permanent.	That	 is	what	 the
masters	 do	 --	 help	 the	 person	 to	 find	 something	 in	 himself	 that	 is	 absolutely
eternal.
That	 is	 the	 goal	 of	 meditation,	 not	 of	 contemplation.	 But	 a	 thinker	 cannot
understand	meditation.	He	cannot	understand	that	you	can	go	out	of	your	mind.
How	can	you	 jump	out	 of	 your	mind?	You	 are	mind.	To	him	you	 are	 nothing
more	than	mind.	And	you	can	see	his	statement:
IF	 YOU	 DON'T	 ANNIHILATE	 THE	 NATURE	 OF	 AFFLICTIONS
SOMEHOW,	AND
ARRIVE	 ON	 THE	 PATH	 OF	 LIBERATION,	 EVEN	 IF	 YOU	 ASCEND	 TO
THE	RANK	OF
SOVEREIGN	 OF	 A	 NATION,	 GREAT	 MINISTER,	 DEITY,	 SPIRIT,	 OR
WIZARD,	IT	IS
STILL	 EVANESCENT	AS	 LIGHTNING	AND	MORNING	DEW,	 LASTING
ONLY	FOR	A	WHILE.
WHEN	CONDITIONS	MEET,	 EVERYTHING	SURELY	SEEMS	TO	EXIST;
BUT
WHEN	THE	CONDITIONS	DISINTEGRATE	--	EMPTINESS.
You	are	 just	a	certain	combination	of	conditions.	When	 those	conditions	meet,
you	are.
When	 those	 conditions	 disintegrate	 --	 nothingness.	A	 buddha	 can	 also	 say	 the
same	 thing,	 but	 he	 says	 it	 because	 he	 knows	 nothingness	 is	 not	 nothingness,
because	 he	 knows	you	have	 entered	 into	 your	 inner	 sky	 --	which	 looks	 to	 the
outsider	like	nothingness.
But	 when	 a	 teacher	 says	 this,	 not	 knowing	 anything	 about	 it,	 there	 is	 every
danger	 that	 he	 will	 create	 people	 who	will	 become	materialists.	 If	 everything
ends	then	what	is	the	point	of	being	virtuous,	what	is	the	point	of	prayer,	what	is
the	point	of	donations,	what	is	the	point	of	service	to	the	poor?	Why	waste	time?
Just	 enjoy	 life	 --	 drink,	 dance,	 do	 whatever	 you	 want	 to,	 because	 death	 will
come.	And	 it	 comes	 to	 everyone,	 the	 saint	 and	 the	 sinner,	 in	 a	 similar	way;	 it
does	not	make	any	categories.
THIS	 BODY	 IS	 GAINED	 THROUGH	 THE	 RELATIONSHIP	 OF	 FATHER
AND
MOTHER.
This	type	of	thing	can	be	told	only	by	a	teacher.	Everybody	knows	this	body	is
gained	 through	 the	 relationship	 of	 father	 and	 mother.	 And	 then	 more	 stupid
things	he	goes	on	saying:	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
55
Chapter	5	-	The	gateway	of	the	buddhas
...	AND	COMES	FROM	THEIR	CONDITIONS.	SOLIDITY	BECOMES	SKIN.
How	can	solidity	become	skin?	If	I	had	met	this	fellow	...	I	have	every	respect
for	his	learning	but	I	would	put	him	to	task,	to	turn	solidity	into	skin	--	or	skin
into	solidity,	that	would	do.
...	 FLESH,	 LIGAMENT,	 AND	 BONE;	 FLUIDITY	 BECOMES	 SPITTLE,
TEARS,	PUS
AND	 BLOOD;	 HEAT	 BECOMES	 WARMTH	 AND	 FLEXIBILITY;	 AIR
BECOMES
BREATH	AND	MOVEMENT.
Great	 philosophy!	 And	 he	 is	 talking	 as	 if	 he	 is	 stating	 some	 scientific
discoveries.
WHEN	THESE	FOUR	CONDITIONS	SUDDENLY	ARE	EXHAUSTED,	THE
BODY
GETS	COLD	AND	THE	BREATH	STOPS.
Great	contemplation!
THERE	 IS	 NOTHING	 CALLED	 "ME."	 AT	 THAT	 TIME	 THIS	 BODY	 IS
REALLY	NOT
OUR	 OWN;	 IT	 IS	 ONLY	 A	 TEMPORARY	 INN.	 HOW	 CAN	 WE	 BE	 SO
GREEDILY
ATTACHED	TO	THIS	TEMPORARY	INN	THAT	WE	IGNORE	ETERNITY?
CONTEMPLATING	 THESE	 FOUR	 TRANSCENDENCES	 --
IMPERMANENCE,	 SUFFERING,	 EMPTINESS,	 SELFLESSNESS	 --
SEEKING	THE	WAY	OF
ENLIGHTENMENT	IS	CALLED,	"THE	TEACHING	OF	FOUR	REALITIES
FOR
DISCIPLES."	 THIS	 IS	 THE	 ESSENTIAL	 GATEWAY	 TO	 BEGINNING
ENTRY	INTO
THE	WAY	FOR	ALL	ENLIGHTENED	ONES.
This	is	the	problem	with	the	learned	scholarship.	They	see	that	the	enlightened
one	 shows	 in	 his	 every	 action	 non-attachment,	 impermanence,	 because	 the
enlightened	one	never	suffers;	in	his	consciousness	he	is	beyond	suffering.	The
scholar	watches	all	these	qualities	from	the	outside	and	then	he	creates	his	great
ideology:	if	you	contemplate	impermanence,	non-attachment,	suffering,	you	will
enter	into	the	gateway	of	the	buddhas.
He	himself	has	not	entered.	These	are	not	the	words	of	a	buddha,	these	are	the
words	of	a	great	teacher	who	has	collected	fragments	of	teachings	from	here	and
there.	And	he	 is	not	honest,	either	 --	no	scholar	 is.	 It	 is	very	difficult	 to	 find	a
scholar	who	will	 say	 that	what	he	 is	 saying	 is	not	his	knowledge.	He	pretends
that	what	he	is	saying,	he	knows,	that	he	is	saying	it	only	because	he	knows.
Every	 scholar,	 almost	without	 exception,	 is	 a	 pretender.	And	 because	 of	 these
pretenders,	 it	becomes	very	difficult	 for	people	 to	figure	out	who	the	authentic
masters	are.	The	scholars	speak	of	the	gateway	of	the	buddha,	they	speak	about
eternity,	they	speak	about	emptiness.
Their	words	are	perfectly	right,	but	the	men	who	are	speaking	them	are	not	right,
because	these	words	are	borrowed.
Once	you	borrow	a	truth	it	becomes	untrue.	Truth	can	arise	only	within	you;	it
cannot	 be	 adopted	 --	 you	 have	 to	 remember	 this.	 In	 life	 you	will	 meet	many
people	 who	 appear	 to	 know	 so	 much	 that	 you	 are	 overwhelmed	 by	 their
knowledge.	But	inside	there	is	nothing,	no	experience.
A	 great	 psychologist,	 head	 of	 the	 department	 of	 psychology	 in	 Varanasi
University	 ...	 I	 was	 only	 a	 student	 and	 one	 of	my	 friends	 had	 gone	 from	 the
college	 to	 study	 in	 Varanasi.	 He	 came	 into	 contact	 with	 this	 psychologist,
Professor	Laljiram	Shukla,	and	the	professor	became	so	much	interested	in	him
that	he	married	his	daughter	to	the	young	man.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
56
Chapter	5	-	The	gateway	of	the	buddhas
The	young	man	was	continuously	talking	about	me	to	him:	"You	should	meet	my
friend."
Continuously	mentioning	me,	he	became	obsessed.
He	started	writing	to	me	saying,	"I	will	pay	all	the	fare	and	you	will	stay	with	me
in	the	university.	You	come,	just	be	a	guest	for	one	week,	because	I	have	heard
so	much	about	you	from	my	son-in-law	that	now	it	is	becoming	a	disturbance	in
me."	So	I	went.
In	the	morning,	nearabout	twenty-five	professors	of	the	university	had	gathered
to	meet	me.	The	professor	of	psychology,	Laljiram	Shukla,	was	perhaps	the	only
great	psychologist	in	India;	people	were	very	respectful	about	him.	We	all	waited
because	he	was	worshipping	the	monkey	god,	Hanuman.	When	his	worship	was
over	he	came	and	he	greeted	me,	and	he	said,
"I	have	been	waiting.	How	long	are	you	going	to	stay?"
I	said,	"That	will	be	decided	within	ten	minutes."
He	said,	"What	do	you	mean?"
I	 said,	 "Just	 sit	 down.	 You	 think	 you	 are	 a	 psychologist	 and	 you	 worship	 a
monkey!	 Do	 you	 believe	 in	 Darwin	 --	 that	man	 is	 born	 out	 of	 the	monkeys?
Perhaps	you	are	worshipping	your	forefathers?"
He	said,	"This	is	very	insulting."
I	said,	"That's	why	I	said	 that	 just	within	 ten	minutes	 I	will	decide	how	long	I
have	to	stay	here.	I	can	stay	here	my	whole	life,	but	I	don't	 think	that	even	for
one	hour	you	will	be	able	to	tolerate	me."
I	questioned	him	directly.	I	said	to	him,	"You	are	worshipping	for	what?	There
must	be	some	desire.	Some	desire	perhaps	to	be	the	vice-chancellor	or	to	be	the
education	 minister	 or	 to	 be	 the	 prime	 minister	 of	 India?	 For	 what	 are	 you
worshipping?	Because	a	man	who	has	no	desire	has	no	need	to	worship.	Do	you
think	a	monkey	can	manage	what	you	cannot	manage?
Why	are	you	putting	yourself	into	such	humiliation	before	a	monkey?"
He	said,	"Don't	refer	to	my	god	again	and	again	by	the	name	'monkey'."
I	said,	"What	can	I	do?	He	is	a	monkey.	And	it	is	not	a	question	of	whether	he	is
your	forefather	or	not.	The	question	is,	a	psychologist	is	still	primitive.	Have	you
seen	God?"
Those	professors	who	had	gathered	became	very	uneasy.	They	had	come	to	see
if	 some	 discussion	 will	 happen	 which	 will	 be	 profitable	 to	 them,	 but	 there
seemed	 to	 be	 no	 way	 to	 discuss	 with	 me.	 I	 said,	 "Non-essentials	 aside,	 just
remember	the	monkey	god	and	tell	the	truth:	have	you	ever	seen	God?"
He	became	so	angry,	he	called	his	son-in-law	and	told	him,	"You	idiot!	You	have
been	harassing	me	again	and	again,	and	now	he	is	disturbing	my	belief	system."
I	said,	"A	man	of	your	understanding	should	not	remain	with	belief	systems.	He
should	have	something	which	he	knows,	not	only	believes,	and	you	don't	have
anything	that	you	know.	Or	if	you	know	just	tell	me,	we	can	discuss	it.	What	is
the	point	of	discussing	something	which	you	don't	know?"
The	ultimate	result	was	that	he	told	his	son-in-law	to	pack	my	suitcases	and	take
me	immediately	to	the	airport.	"I	don't	want	such	a	man;	in	seven	days	he	will
destroy	 my	 whole	 life's	 religiousness."	 And	 because	 all	 the	 professors	 came
down	to	say	goodbye	to	me,	he	was	very	angry.	Later	on	his	son-in-law	wrote	to
me,	saying	that	he	was	so	angry	with	all	the	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
57
Chapter	5	-	The	gateway	of	the	buddhas
professors:	"You	left	me	alone	and	you	went	with	him	to	say	goodbye	to	him.	It
seems	you	agree	with	him."
They	said,	"There	 is	no	question	of	agreement	--	you	misbehaved.	If	you	don't
know,	 you	 should	 have	 said,	 'I	 don't	 know.'	 That	 would	 have	 been	 more
dignified.	You	 had	 been	 inviting	 him,	 he	 had	 not	 come	 on	 his	 own;	 now	 you
have	thrown	him	out	of	the	house.	Still,	he	was	not	angry,	he	was	just	laughing."
I	said,	"I	knew	it.	That's	why	I	did	not	give	the	time,	how	long	I	would	be	there.	I
know	myself."
But	later	on	he	felt	very	guilty.	And	he	also	felt,	how	is	he	going	to	face	all	those
twenty-five	professors	 in	 the	university?	He	wrote	 to	me	a	 letter	of	 apology.	 I
answered	him	that	"There	is	no	question	of	apology.	You	have	not	insulted	me,
you	have	only	 insulted	 yourself.	You	have	been	 insulting	yourself	 your	whole
life	 --	 by	 your	 worshipping,	 by	 your	 so-called	 religiousness,	 by	 all	 kinds	 of
belief	systems.	And	not	knowing	a	single	thing.	It	 is	good	that	I	accepted	your
invitation	and	created	a	chaos	in	your	mind.	Perhaps,	seeing	the	chaos,	you	will
come	out	of	the	mind.	And	that	is	the	world	I	had	come	to	discuss	with	you	--
the	world	beyond	mind."	But	for	the	scholars	mind	is	all.
When	 all	 the	 conditions	 collapse,	 Torei	 is	 saying,	 nothing	 remains.	 This	word
'nothing'	has	very	strange	connotations.	When	a	buddha	says	"nothing"	he	means
no-thing,	and	when	a	scholar	says	"nothing"	he	simply	means	emptiness.	When	a
buddha	 says	 "nothing"	 he	 says	 there	 is	 no-thing	 anymore:	 pure	 space,	 utter
silence	...
We	all	speak	the	same	language.	The	master	has	also	to	use	the	same	language
but	 he	 gives	 new	meanings	 to	words,	 new	 fragrances	 to	words,	 new	poetry	 to
words.	 They	 go	 dancing	 into	 your	 heart,	 the	 same	 ordinary	 words,	 with	 such
extraordinary	radiance,	penetration.	But	one	has	to	be	a	knower	himself.
This	 gathering	 is	 not	 for	 those	 who	 are	 interested	 in	 studying	 religion.	 This
gathering	is	only	for	those	who	are	interested	in	experiencing	what	religion	is	all
about.	It	is	an	existential,	experimental	lab.	It	is	as	scientific	as	any	science.	No
question	of	belief	 --	 you	 are	not	 asked	what	you	believe.	No	question	of	your
mind	--	whatever	kind	of	mind	you	have,	just	put	it	aside.
You	may	have	a	great	learned	mind;	that	is	perfectly	okay,	put	it	aside.	You	may
have	a	very	ordinary	mind,	uneducated;	no	matter,	just	put	it	by	the	side	of	the
great	scholar's	mind.
Mind	has	no	value	here.	The	value	arises	only	when	mind	is	no	more	there.	Then
you	start	growing	into	a	different	dimension	which	can	only	be	called	existential.
Before	we	do	our	meditation,	a	few	words	from	some	authentic	masters.
A	haiku	by	Issa:
LISTEN,
ALL	CREEPING	THINGS	--
THE	BELL	OF	TRANSIENCE.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
58
Chapter	5	-	The	gateway	of	the	buddhas
Nothing	to	be	done,	just	listen	...	everything	is	changing.	What	is	the	point?	The
point	is	that	the	listener	is	never	changing;	the	watcher	is	always	there.	That	is
the	only	permanent	thing	in	existence.
LISTEN	--	or	watch	--
ALL	CREEPING	THINGS	--
THE	BELL	OF	TRANSIENCE.
Now,	 any	 scholar	 can	 repeat	 that,	 there	 is	 no	 problem	 --	 the	 words	 are	 very
simple.	But	Issa	KNOWS	it.
Sengai	says:
WHAT	MIND	DO	YOU	PUNCTUATE?
THE	PAST,	PRESENT,	OR	FUTURE?
THE	CANDLE	IS	BLOWN	OUT,
AND	THE	DIAMOND	TURNS	TO	ASHES.
He	is	saying	the	same	thing:	WHAT	MIND	DO	YOU	PUNCTUATE?	The	past
is	no	more,	the	future	is	not	yet,	and	if	there	is	no	past	and	no	future,	how	can
there	be	any	present?
What	time	...	WHAT	MIND	DO	YOU	PUNCTUATE?	Neither	the	mind	is	there,
nor	 time	 is	 there.	 When	 mind	 and	 time	 both	 disappear,	 THE	 CANDLE	 IS
BLOWN	OUT.
That	 is	exactly	 the	meaning	of	 the	word	 'nirvana':	THE	CANDLE	IS	BLOWN
OUT.	Now	can	you	find	the	flame	of	the	candle?	Even	if	you	look	through	the
whole	universe	you	will	not	find	it.	It	has	simply	become	one	with	the	universe.
The	moment	 the	 candle	 of	mind,	which	 is	 equivalent	 to	 the	 candle	 of	 time,	 is
blown	out	--	utter	silence	...	Nothing	is	found,	but	tremendous	peace,	a	feeling	of
coming	home	...
Question	1
Maneesha	has	a	question:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
CAN	IT	HELP	TO	CONTEMPLATE	ON	A	CONCEPT?	IF	THE	CONCEPT	IS
JUST
ONE'S	 INTELLECTUAL	 UNDERSTANDING,	 OR	 SOMEONE	 ELSE'S
INSIGHT,	WHAT
IS	 THE	 VALUE?	 AND	 EVEN	 IF	 IT	 IS	 OUT	 OF	 ONE'S	 OWN	 INSIGHT,
WHAT	IS	THE
POINT?	--	IF	YOU	HAVE	KNOWN	IT,	YOU	HAVE	KNOWN	IT.
Maneesha,	 this	 not	 a	 question	 --	 this	 is	 the	 answer.	 There	 is	 nothing	 to
contemplate	 and	 there	 is	 nobody	 to	 contemplate.	When	you	disappear	with	 all
your	 mind	 and	 not	 even	 a	 trace	 remains	 behind,	 just	 a	 pure	 sky	 ...	 you	 have
found.	 I	will	not	 say	what,	because	 the	moment	you	say	what	you	have	 found
you	defile	it.	It	is	inexpressible	ecstasy.
Thousands	 of	 buddhas	 have	 tried	 to	 bring	 it	 down	 to	 words;	 nobody	 has
succeeded.	It	 is	 just	not	 in	 the	nature	of	 things	 that	 the	ultimate	ecstasy	can	be
brought	into	words.

Before	we	enter	into,	not	contemplation,	but	meditation,	I	don't	want	you	to	be
serious.	 I	 am	 so	 against	 seriousness	 --	 it	 is	 a	 spiritual	 sickness.	 Laughter	 is
spiritual	health.	And	laughter	is	very	unburdening.	While	you	laugh,	you	can	put
your	 mind	 aside	 very	 easily.	 For	 a	 man	 who	 cannot	 laugh	 the	 doors	 of	 the
buddha	are	closed.
To	me,	laughter	is	one	of	the	greatest	values.	No	religion	has	ever	thought	about
it.	 They	 have	 always	 been	 insisting	 on	 seriousness,	 and	 because	 of	 their
insistence	the	whole	world	is	psychologically	sick.
"Hey,	 listen	 to	 this,	man!"	 says	 Starlight	 Butterfly,	 the	 aging	 hippy,	 passing	 a
reefer	to	his	friend,	Golden	Buffalo-Grass.
"These	guys	at	Ectoplasm	Arcade	are	offering	Astral	Projection	Tours."
"Really?"	says	Golden	Buffalo-Grass,	puffing	madly.	"What	does	it	say?"
"It	says,"	replies	Butterfly,	"if	you	are	an	average	occult	freak	off	the	street,	you
are	 probably	 pretty	 good	 at	 popping	 out	 of	 your	 body	 and	 staring	 at	 yourself.
Like	acid,	man	--
you	only	do	it	so	many	times,	then	you	get	bored.
"Wouldn't	it	be	great	if	you	could	put	your	ability	to	some	greater	use	than	just
hanging	 out	 in	 Nowhere's-Ville?	 How	 about	 a	 trip	 to	 the	 divine	 Deep-Space
Disco,	or	the	Big	Dipper	Dance	Hall?"
Coughing	on	his	reefer,	Butterfly	reads	on,	"Now	we	introduce	Astral	Projection
Tours.
We	get	you	 to	 those	 far-out	 scenes	where	 the	physical	body	 just	can't	make	 it.
Pop	 out	 of	 your	 skinbag,	 and	 cruise	 to	 outta-sight	 places	 and	 meet	 strange
beings.
"Astral	 Projection	 Tours	 offers	 individual	 or	 group	 tours	 to	 the	 seven	 hells	 of

"Wow,	man!	This	 is	 cool,"	 shouts	Buffalo-Grass,	 lighting	another	 reefer.	 "This
sounds	far-out.	I'm	packing	right	now.	I'm	gonna	drop	my	body	and	tune	into	the
Cosmos!"
"Hey,	man!"	shouts	Butterfly,	in	a	cloud	of	smoke,	"where	are	you	going?"
"Going?	 I'm	 halfway	 there!"	 shouts	 Buffalo-Grass,	 swallowing	 his	 reefer	 and
standing	on	his	head.	"I'm	gonna	take	my	astral	ass	and	jog	with	Jesus,	mule	ride
with	Mohammed,	and	go	bowling	with	Buddha!"

Be	silent.	Mind	you	have	thrown	out.
Close	your	eyes.
Feel	the	body	to	be	completely	frozen.
Look	inwards.
At	the	very	center	of	your	being,
is	the	door	of	the	buddhas.
Deeper	...	and	deeper.
Without	any	fear,	go	in	as	far	as	you	can.
You	 will	 not	 meet	 anybody	 on	 the	 way	 except	 yourself.	 And	 meeting	 with
oneself	is	the	meaning	of	being	a	buddha.
One	who	 has	 encountered	 himself,	 realized	 himself,	 has	 become	 centered	 into
himself,	is	a	buddha.	This	is	the	potential	of	everyone.

Relax.	Feel	the	body	to	be	completely	dead.
The	head	has	fallen	somewhere	else	and	you	are	simply	a	watcher,	not	a	doer;
not	a	 thinker,	but	 just	a	witness.	And	 the	evening	becomes	beautiful.	And	you
will	come	out	completely	drunk	with	the	divine.
You	have	 to	carry	 this	silence,	 this	suchness	 in	every	action,	around	 the	clock.
There	 is	no	greater	 ecstasy,	no	greater	blessing,	 than	 to	have	 found	your	 inner
being	--	the	buddha.
This	moment	you	are	all	buddhas.
This	moment	you	are	not	separate	from	each	other.
It	is	an	ocean	of	consciousness
in	which	you	are	all	dissolved.
Let	it	sink	deep	in	you
that	you	are	not	separate	from	existence.
Nivedano	...
(Drumbeat)
Come	back.	But	come	back	as	buddhas,
without	any	hesitation,
in	silence,	in	grace,	in	beauty.
Just	 sit	 like	 buddhas	 for	 a	 few	 moments	 --	 remembering,	 collecting	 the
experience	you	have	passed	through.	Slowly	slowly	it	 is	going	to	become	your
very	heartbeat.	That	day	will	be	the	most	fortunate	day	in	your	life.
Okay,	Maneesha?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.
Can	we	celebrate	the	gathering	of	the	buddhas?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.

Be	a	rare	person
4	 September	 1988	 pm	 in	 Gautam	 the	 Buddha	 Auditorium	 OUR	 BELOVED
MASTER,
A	 MONK	 ASKED	 BANKEI,	 "THE	 ANCESTRAL	 TEACHERS	 SINCE
ANCIENT
TIMES	 WERE	 GREATLY	 ENLIGHTENED	 THROUGH	 DIFFICULT	 AND
PAINFUL
PRACTICES.	 I	 HAVE	 HEARD	 THAT	 YOU,	 TOO,	 ACCOMPLISHED	 THE
GREAT
TEACHING	 THROUGH	 VARIOUS	 DIFFICULT	 PRACTICES.	 BUT	 FOR
PEOPLE	LIKE
ME,	 WHO	 DON'T	 CULTIVATE	 PRACTICE,	 AND	 ARE	 NOT
ENLIGHTENED,	JUST
REALIZING	THAT	MY	VERY	STATE	 IS	 THE	UNBORN,	 ENLIGHTENED
NO-MIND
DOES	NOT	REALLY	SETTLE	ANYTHING."
BANKEI	REPLIED:
"IT	 IS	 LIKE	 THE	 CASE	OF	 TRAVELERS	WHO	CROSS	 THE	 PEAKS	OF
HIGH
MOUNTAINS	WHERE	THERE	 IS	NO	WATER,	AND	BECOME	THIRSTY.
SOMEONE
SEEKS	 OUT	 WATER	 IN	 A	 DISTANT	 VALLEY,	 BREAKING	 HIS	 BACK
SEARCHING
HERE	AND	THERE.	FINALLY,	HE	FINDS	WATER	AND	BRINGS	IT	BACK
TO	GIVE
TO	THE	OTHERS	TO	DRINK.
"EVEN	 THOUGH	 THEY	 HAVE	 NOT	 STRUGGLED	 SO,	 THOSE	 WHO
DRINK	ARE
REFRESHED,	 JUST	 THE	 SAME	 AS	 THE	 ONE	WHO	WENT	 THROUGH
THE	TROUBLE
BEFORE.	 AS	 FOR	 THOSE	 WHO	 ARE	 DOUBTFUL	 AND	 WILL	 NOT
DRINK,	THERE	IS
NO	WAY	FOR	THEIR	THIRST	TO	BE	QUENCHED.
"BECAUSE	 I	 DIDN'T	 MEET	 SOMEONE	 WITH	 ENLIGHTENED	 EYES,	 I
MISTAKENLY	 WORE	 MYSELF	 OUT.	 I	 FINALLY	 DISCOVERED	 THE
BUDDHA	IN	MY
OWN	NO-MIND,	AND	AM	TELLING	EVERYONE	ABOUT	THE	BUDDHA
OF	THEIR
OWN	 NO-MIND,	 WITHOUT	 THEM	 HAVING	 TO	 DO	 ANYTHING
DIFFICULT	--	JUST
LIKE	DRINKING	WATER	AND	HAVING	THEIR	THIRST	QUENCHED.
"USING	THE	ENLIGHTENED	NO-MIND	INHERENT	IN	EVERYONE,	JUST
AS	IT
IS,	HAVING	FOUND	PEACE	AND	BLISS,	WITHOUT	THE	DIFFICULTIES
OF
CONFUSION	--	IS	THIS	NOT	A	SACRED	TRUE	TEACHING?"
AT	ANOTHER	TIME	SOMEONE	ASKED	BANKEI,	"IS	THE	COMPLETE
ILLUMINATION	 OF	 THE	 EYE	 OF	 REALITY	 ACCOMPLISHED	 WITH
TIME	AND
SEASON,	OR	IS	IT	REALIZED	EVEN	IN	ONE	DAY?"
BANKEI	REPLIED,	"IT	IS	NOT	A	MATTER	OF	TIME	AND	SEASON;	IT	IS
ACCOMPLISHED	 ONLY	 WHEN	 THE	 EYE	 OF	 THE	 WAY	 IS	 CLEAR,
WITHOUT	ANY
GAP.	 IT	 IS	 ACCOMPLISHED	 BY	 THE	 PRACTICE	 OF	 SINGLE-MINDED
DEVOTION
TO	NURTURING	IT."
Maneesha,	 Bankei	 is	 one	 of	my	most	 favorite	 Zen	masters,	 but	 that	 does	 not
mean	that	I	agree	with	him	on	every	point.	With	the	essentials	I	am	in	absolute
agreement,	but	with	the	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
63
Chapter	6	-	Be	a	rare	person
non-essentials	I	disagree.	And	it	has	to	be	remembered	by	you	that	to	love	a	man
does	 not	 mean	 to	 agree	 with	 him	 or	 to	 disagree	 with	 him.	 Agreement	 and
disagreement	 are	 far	 below	 the	world	 of	 love.	 I	 love	 Bankei	 just	 for	 his	 own
sake.	He	is	a	unique	enlightened	man	with	a	tremendous	vision	of	reality,	but	on
the	non-essentials	I	don't	agree	with	him.
Perhaps	 the	 times	 have	 changed.	Perhaps	 I	 am	a	 different	 kind	of	 person,	 and
perhaps	the	people	who	are	hearing	me	are	a	totally	different	world.	I	respond	to
Bankei	according	to	you,	I	see	Bankei	 in	 the	context	of	you;	otherwise	Bankei
has	no	meaning.	We	are	discussing	him	for	the	simple	reason	that	he	may	give
some	light	to	you	on	the	path.	Even	if	a	slight	glimpse	of	the	ultimate	is	attained
through	him,	it	is	more	than	enough.
I	will	 tell	you	where	 I	 agree	and	where	 I	don't	 agree,	but	 as	 far	 as	my	 love	 is
concerned	it	is	absolute.	I	love	the	man	and	respect	him.	But	it	is	natural	that	as
time	 changes,	 language	 changes.	 Symbols	 change,	 metaphors	 change,	 and
everything	that	was	said	a	thousand	years	ago	cannot	be	repeated	exactly,	except
by	parrots.
Bankei	 had	 a	 great	 school	 of	 his	 own.	 He	 is	 still	 followed	 by	 thousands	 of
people.	I	have	met	a	few	of	Bankei's	disciples,	and	when	I	told	them	that	I	agree
on	 the	 fundamentals	 but	 I	 don't	 agree	 on	 the	 non-essentials,	 they	 could	 not
believe	me.	They	said,	"If	you	love	the	master,	if	you	have	some	feeling	for	him,
then	how	can	you	disagree?"
My	position	is	totally	different.	If	you	love	a	person	only	then	do	you	have	the
right	to	disagree.	If	you	don't	love	a	person,	what	right	have	you	got	to	disagree?
Only	love	gives	you	the	freedom	of	agreeing	or	not	agreeing.	Without	love	there
is	no	freedom.	You	are	forced	to	agree	as	all	the	religions	of	the	world	are	doing
--	 forcing	people	 in	psychological	ways	 to	believe	 in	certain	 things	and	not	 to
believe	in	certain	other	things.
Their	ways	of	forcing	are	very	subtle,	they	are	using	your	whole	unenlightened
unconscious	 mind.	 Your	 greed	 is	 expanded	 up	 to	 heaven.	What	 is	 heaven	 or
paradise	 except	 your	 greed	multiplied	 by	 thousands?	And	what	 is	 hell	 except
your	 fear?	And	what	are	all	 the	priests	of	all	 the	 religions	of	 the	world	doing?
They	 are	 doing	 the	 same	 thing	whether	 they	 are	Mohammedans	 or	Hindus	 or
Christians	 or	 Jews.	They	 are	 giving	you	 a	 consolation	 in	 your	misery,	 in	 your
suffering;	they	are	consoling	you	that	it	is	not	going	to	last	forever	--	this	world
is	 miserable	 but	 beyond	 this	 world	 open	 the	 doors	 of	 paradise	 and	 eternal
pleasure,	so	just	have	a	little	patience.	Karl	Marx	was	not	wrong	when	he	said
that	religions	have	functioned	as	the	opium	of	the	people.	I	am	not	a	Marxist	but
this	statement	I	cannot	deny,	he	is	absolutely	right.	Religions	have	proved	to	be
opium.
In	Indian	villages	where	women	go	to	work	in	the	fields,	or	somewhere	where	a
road	 is	 being	made,	 or	 a	 bridge	 is	 being	made,	 and	 the	women	working	 have
small	children	 ...	One	day	I	was	 just	walking	by	 the	side	of	 the	 river,	a	bridge
was	being	built	and	there	was	a	small	child	under	a	tree,	so	happy,	so	joyous,	so
ecstatic.	I	could	not	believe	...	what	could	be	the	cause	of	it?	So	I	waited	by	the
side	of	 the	 tree.	His	mother	was	working	on	 the	bridge,	and	she	came	back	 to
give	some	milk	to	the	child.	I	said	to	her,	"You	have	a	really	great	child.	I	have
never	come	across	such	a	psychedelic	child	in	my	whole	life."
She	 said,	 "It	 is	 nothing.	We	 poor	 people,	 what	 can	we	 do?	We	 cannot	 afford
somebody	to	take	care	of	the	child,	so	we	give	the	child	some	opium.	Whether
he	is	hungry	or	thirsty,	whether	it	is	hot	or	cold,	it	does	not	matter.	In	his	opium,
he	is	enjoying	paradise."
All	the	religions	have	been	giving	opium	to	their	followers	and	hell	to	those	who
don't	 follow	 them.	 But	 it	 is	 not	 the	 way	 of	 authentic	 religion	 to	 use	 people's
psychology	--	their	fears,	their	greed,	their	ambitions.	It	is	not	the	way	of	love.	It
is	very	cruel	because	if	you	use	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
64
Chapter	6	-	Be	a	rare	person
people's	greed	you	are	not	going	 to	 transform	 them.	And	you	will	 be	 afraid	 if
somebody	 else	 tries	 to	 transform	 them,	 because	 you	 cannot	 afford	 that	 they
should	drop	their	greed	and	their	fear.
Very	few	people	in	the	whole	of	history	have	been	able	to	drop	their	fears	and
look	directly	into	reality.	There	is	no	hell	and	there	is	no	heaven,	but	there	is	a
beautiful	existence,	so	beautiful	 that	your	dreams	cannot	dream	it.	You	have	to
realize	it.
The	authentic	experienced	master	will	not	ask	for	your	belief	or	disbelief,	he	will
ask	only	for	your	inquiry.	He	will	tell	you	that	the	well	is	not	far	away,	so	don't
remain	 thirsty.	 If	 you	 are	 clinging	 to	 your	 suffering,	 nobody	 except	 you	 is
responsible.	You	can	drop	all	your	suffering,	all	your	misery,	if	you	can	just	drop
your	mind.	It	is	all	mind	phenomena.
I	love	Bankei.	He	was	asked:
THE	ANCESTRAL	TEACHERS	SINCE	ANCIENT	TIMES	WERE	GREATLY
ENLIGHTENED	 THROUGH	 DIFFICULT	 AND	 PAINFUL	 PRACTICES.	 I
HAVE	HEARD
THAT	YOU,	TOO,	ACCOMPLISHED	THE	GREAT	TEACHING	THROUGH
VARIOUS
DIFFICULT	 PRACTICES.	 BUT	 FOR	 PEOPLE	 LIKE	 ME,	 WHO	 DON'T
CULTIVATE
PRACTICE,	AND	ARE	NOT	ENLIGHTENED,	JUST	REALIZING	THAT	MY
VERY
STATE	IS	THE	UNBORN,	ENLIGHTENED	NO-MIND	DOES	NOT	REALLY
SETTLE
ANYTHING.
For	 centuries	 there	 have	been	 seekers	 divided	on	 this	 point.	There	 are	 seekers
who	say	that	enlightenment	comes	gradually.	You	have	to	work	for	it,	you	have
to	 do	 many	 kinds	 of	 practices	 for	 it.	 It	 is	 a	 faraway	 star	 and	 the	 journey	 is
tedious,	 and	 you	 almost	 have	 to	 pass	 through	 self-torture	 in	 the	 name	 of
disciplining	yourself.	The	other	school	says	that	enlightenment	is	always	sudden.
It	 is	 not	 a	 question	 of	 traveling	 anywhere	 or	 going	 anywhere,	 it	 is	 simply	 a
question	of	awakening	to	your	own	self.
Perhaps	in	the	night,	in	your	dream	you	may	have	been	visiting	a	faraway	star.
But	as	you	wake	up,	you	know	you	have	not	gone	anywhere,	you	have	always
been	 here.	 Your	 mind	 feels	 misery,	 suffering;	 it	 feels	 all	 kinds	 of	 emotions,
attachments,	desires	and	longings,	but	it	is	all	the	projection	of	the	mind.	Behind
the	mind	is	your	real	self	which	has	never	gone	anywhere.
It	is	always	here	and	here.
So	 the	 question	 of	 enlightenment,	 whether	 it	 is	 gradual	 or	 sudden,	 is	 a	 very
complicated	 one.	 Those	 who	 say	 it	 is	 gradual,	 they	 make	 steps,	 procedures,
disciplines	to	be	followed.	And	in	this	way,	perhaps,	after	many	lives	you	may
become	 a	 buddha.	 The	 people	 who	 believe	 in	 sudden	 enlightenment	 have	 no
discipline,	 no	 rules,	 except	 for	 a	 simple	 thing	 --	 wake	 up,	 don't	 remain	 a
somnambulist.	Don't	act	out	of	sleep,	act	out	of	awakening!
So	on	the	path	of	sudden	enlightenment	all	that	is	needed	is	to	go	withinwards,
to	look	inside	and	to	find	the	point	which	can	be	aware	twenty-four	hours.	And
the	point	is	there,	you	are	just	keeping	your	back	towards	it.	Wherever	you	go,	it
is	always	with	you.	It	is	the	very	center	of	your	existence;	without	it	you	cannot
exist	for	a	single	moment.
The	question	is	not	of	some	gradual	attainment	or	achievement.	The	question	is
of	 a	 great	 turning	 in.	 Our	 eyes	 look	 outside,	 our	 desires	 reach	 for	 the	 stars.
Turning	in	means	no	desires,	no	greed,	no	paradise,	no	God	--	just	looking	into
your	own	space,	what	is	hidden	in	you.
From	where	comes	this	life?	From	where	comes	this	consciousness?
As	 you	 go	 deeper	 within	 yourself,	 you	 will	 find	 the	 center,	 and	 not	 only	 of
yourself.	It	will	be	the	center	of	the	whole	existence.	At	the	center	we	meet,	on
the	periphery	we	are	separate.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
65
Chapter	6	-	Be	a	rare	person
We	are	separate	only	in	our	bodies,	in	our	minds,	but	beyond	body	and	mind	we
are	 just	 an	 ocean	 of	 consciousness.	 There	 is	 no	 'I	 am',	 there	 is	 simply	 pure
awareness	with	no	distinctions,	no	divisions.
In	the	moment	of	enlightenment	even	the	trees	and	the	birds	and	the	mountains	-
-
everything	 becomes	 enlightened.	 There	 is	 a	 saying	 of	 Gautam	 Buddha,	 "The
moment	I	became	enlightened,	the	whole	universe	became	enlightened."	It	could
be	disputed,	because	we	can	see	that	we	are	not	enlightened,	but	his	meaning	is
totally	 different.	 He	 is	 speaking	 for	 himself.	 From	 that	 moment	 everything
becomes	 enlightened	because	he	has	 seen	 the	very	 root	 from	where	 life	 arises
and	goes	on	eternally	arising,	with	no	beginning,	no	end.
Bankei	 was	 asked,	 "In	 the	 ancient	 times	 sages	 used	 to	 practice	 difficult	 and
arduous	 disciplines	 and	 then	 finally	 after	 many	 years,	 after	 many	 lives,	 they
became	 enlightened.	 But	 in	 your	 case	 it	 seems	 to	 be	 different.	 You	 have	 not
practiced	any	discipline,	you	have	not	tortured	yourself	by	fasting.	You	have	not
distorted	your	body	by	yoga.	How	did	you	become	enlightened?"
BANKEI	REPLIED:	IT	IS	LIKE	THE	CASE	OF	TRAVELERS	WHO	CROSS
THE
PEAKS	 OF	 HIGH	 MOUNTAINS	 WHERE	 THERE	 IS	 NO	 WATER,	 AND
BECOME
THIRSTY.	 SOMEONE	 SEEKS	 OUT	 WATER	 IN	 A	 DISTANT	 VALLEY,
BREAKING	HIS
BACK	 SEARCHING	 HERE	 AND	 THERE.	 FINALLY,	 HE	 FINDS	 WATER
AND	BRINGS
IT	BACK	TO	GIVE	TO	THE	OTHERS	TO	DRINK.
EVEN	 THOUGH	 THEY	 HAVE	 NOT	 STRUGGLED	 SO,	 THOSE	 WHO
DRINK	ARE
REFRESHED,	 JUST	 THE	 SAME	 AS	 THE	 ONE	WHO	WENT	 THROUGH
THE	TROUBLE
BEFORE.
I	 don't	 agree	 on	 this	 point.	 Everybody	 has	 to	 find	 his	 own	 enlightenment.
Nobody	can	give	it	to	you.
Bankei	is	saying	that	somebody	else	can	bring	the	water.	About	water	it	is	okay,
it	 is	 something	 objective	 and	 outside.	Water	 can	 be	 brought,	 but	 nobody	 can
bring	enlightenment	to	you.
It	 has	 to	 be	 very	 deeply	 understood	 that	 enlightenment	 is	 an	 individual
revolution.
Somebody	can	give	you	a	challenge,	somebody	can	provoke	you	to	the	search,
somebody's	presence	may	infect	you,	but	nobody	can	give	you	enlightenment.
If	 it	was	something	that	could	be	given,	 it	would	have	been	very	easy	to	make
the	whole	world	enlightened.	It	could	be	patented,	marketed	--	then	you	just	go
to	 the	 M.G.Road	 and	 have	 a	 little	 drink	 of	 enlightenment;	 then	 the	 rich	 will
gather	great	amounts	of	enlightenment	and	the	poor	will	suffer.
At	 least	 as	 far	 as	 enlightenment	 is	 concerned,	 don't	 make	 it	 a	 material,
quantitative	phenomenon.	It	is	a	subjective,	qualitative	experience	just	like	love.
Can	you	give	love	to	somebody?	There	is	no	way.	You	can	love	somebody,	but
you	cannot	give	love	to	somebody.
Love	is	your	inner	experience,	so	deep	that	you	cannot	even	define	what	it	is.	All
the	 poets,	 all	 the	 philosophers	 have	 been	 trying	 to	 define	 what	 love	 is.	 And
thousands	 of	 years	 of	 search	 and	 enquiry	 have	 resulted	 only	 in	 the	 simple
statement	 that	 love	 is	 indefinable.	 You	 can	 sing	 it,	 you	 can	 dance	 it,	 but	 you
cannot	define	it.	Exactly	the	same,	on	a	higher	level,	is	enlightenment.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
66
Chapter	6	-	Be	a	rare	person
According	to	me	love	is	the	lowest	rung	of	the	ladder	and	enlightenment	is	the
highest.
They	have	a	similarity	on	many	points.	They	both	happen	suddenly	--	you	fall	in
love	 and	 if	 somebody	 asks	 you	 why,	 you	 simply	 shrug	 your	 shoulders.	 You
cannot	 answer	why.	 Love	 is	 not	 something	 to	 be	 questioned.	You	 don't	 know
yourself,	it	just	happens.
Enlightenment	 is	 the	 same	 kind	 of	 phenomenon	 on	 a	 higher	 peak.	 It	 just
happens.	 It	 happens	when	 you	 are	 silent,	 looking	 inwards.	 Just	 like	 lightning,
you	suddenly	become	aware,	full	of	 light,	 luminous.	It	 is	not	an	answer	 to	any
question.	All	questions	 and	all	 answers	dissolve	 into	 the	 luminous	 splendor	of
your	own	inner	being.
I	differ	from	Bankei	in	saying	that	nobody	else	can	give	it	to	you.	If	somebody
has	 found	 it,	 perhaps	 he	 can	 inspire	 you	 --	 not	 by	 his	words,	 but	 by	 his	 very
being,	by	his	every	gesture,	by	his	every	look.	You	can	see	that	a	different	kind
of	presence	surrounds	the	man,	a	different	kind	of	silence	radiates	from	him.	You
can	have	a	taste	from	somebody	else,	but	nobody	can	give	it	to	you.
It	 used	 to	 happen	 that	 seekers	 would	 come	 to	 Gautam	 Buddha.	 A	 great
philosopher	of	those	times,	Maulingaputta,	came	with	his	five	hundred	disciples.
He	 himself	was	 a	well-known	 teacher,	 and	 he	 had	 come	 to	 challenge	Gautam
Buddha	to	a	debate;	that's	why	he	had	brought	all	his	disciples.
In	 India	 it	was	 a	 common	phenomenon	 that	 has	 now	disappeared	 ...	 it	was	 so
beautiful	--
but	 now	 to	 challenge	 somebody	 seems	 to	 be	 a	 way	 to	 create	 enemies.	 For
centuries	 it	 was	 not	 considered	 that	 way	 in	 India;	 challenging	 was	 simply	 a
matter	of	coming	face	to	face,	with	inquiring,	penetrating	questions,	and	finding
out	who	has	gone	deeper.	The	one	who	went	deeper	was	victorious.	It	was	a	very
loving	phenomenon,	very	friendly.
Maulingaputta	said	to	Gautam	Buddha,	"I	have	come	here	to	pay	my	respects	to
you	and	also	to	challenge	you."
Buddha	 said,	 "I	 love	 your	 challenge.	 But	 you	 will	 have	 to	 fulfill	 a	 condition
which	I	have	been	keeping	my	whole	life.	I	cannot	make	any	exception."
At	that	time	there	were	ten	thousand	monks,	disciples	of	Buddha.	Maulingaputta
said,
"Any	condition,	and	I	am	ready	to	accept	it."
So	Buddha	said,	"The	condition	is	that	you	have	to	sit	by	my	side	for	two	years,
silently	--
no	question,	no	answer.	After	two	years	I	will	tell	you,	now	you	can	question."
Bankei's	 lineage	 comes	 from	 Mahakashyap.	 Mahakashyap	 was	 a	 rare	 being,
nobody	 had	 ever	 heard	 him	 speak.	 He	 never	 asked	 any	 question,	 he	 never
answered	anybody,	even	a	hello	was	too	much.	People	simply	passed	by	his	side
as	 if	he	was	not.	He	had	a	 special	 tree	where	he	used	 to	 sit	whenever	Buddha
was	 speaking.	When	Buddha	 said	 to	Maulingaputta,	 "You	 have	 to	 sit	 for	 two
years	 silently	 by	my	 side	 and	 then	 you	 can	 have	 any	 inquiry,	 any	 debate,	 any
discussion,	any	question,"	 there	was	suddenly	a	great	outburst	 --	Mahakashyap
laughed	loudly.
The	 whole	 assembly	 felt	 very	 strange	 because	 this	 man	 had	 never	 talked	 to
anybody,	and	there	was	no	special	reason	that	he	should	laugh.	But	he	must	have
been	a	reincarnation	of	Sardar	Gurudayal	Singh,	or	vice	versa.	Sardar	is	the	only
man	in	the	whole	world	who	can	laugh	before	a	joke	is	told.	It	does	not	matter,
what	matters	is	the	laughter.	Why	not	enjoy	it,	why	wait?	It	is	a	deep	trust	that
something	good	will	be	coming.
Maulingaputta	said,	"Why	is	this	fellow	laughing?"
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
67
Chapter	6	-	Be	a	rare	person
Buddha	said,	"You	can	ask	him	yourself.	He	is	a	rare	person,	he	never	speaks.	In
the	twenty	years	he	has	been	with	me	he	has	never	asked	any	question.	It	is	for
the	first	time	that	suddenly	he	has	exploded	in	laughter."
So	Maulingaputta	asked	Mahakashyap,	"Why	did	you	laugh?"
Mahakashyap	 said,	 "I	 laughed	 because	 this	 fellow	Gautam	Buddha	 is	 a	 tricky
guy.	He	tricked	me	with	the	same	trick;	he	told	me	to	sit	for	two	years	and	I	have
been	sitting	for	twenty	years!	Now	the	desire	to	question	or	to	debate	has	been
left	miles	back.	So	if	you	want	to	ask,	ask	now;	otherwise	you	will	be	sitting	just
like	me.	And	 there	are	many	other	monks	who	will	be	witnesses	 to	what	 I	am
saying."
Buddha	had	a	lotus	flower	in	his	hand.	At	that	moment	he	called	Mahakashyap
and	gave	the	lotus	flower	to	him	with	the	words,	"What	I	have	been	able	to	say,	I
have	 said	 to	 everybody.	And	what	 I	 have	 not	 been	 able	 to	 say,	 I	 transfer	 it	 to
you."
This	is	called	in	Zen	the	transmission	of	the	lamp.	Nothing	is	said.	But	in	twenty
years	 of	 silence	 one	 becomes	 enlightened	 oneself.	 It	 is	 not	 something	 that
Buddha	has	given.	Buddha	has	simply	created	a	situation.
Maulingaputta	 remained	 silent	 for	 two	years	 and	he	 even	 forgot	 the	 time,	 that
two	years	had	passed.	It	was	Buddha	who	had	to	remind	him,	"Maulingaputta,
now	two	years	have	passed.	Come	on	and	confront	me."
He	 came	 and	 touched	 Gautam	 Buddha's	 feet	 and	 he	 said,	 "I	 am	 sorry,	 I	 was
arrogant.	I	did	not	understand	what	enlightenment	is.	Now	don't	make	me	more
ashamed.	 Just	 being	 in	 silence	 for	 two	years	 all	 thoughts	 have	 disappeared.	A
deep	silence	reigns	inside	and	I	have	found	myself	and	the	beauty	and	the	truth
and	 the	 good	 --	 all	 together	 in	 my	 own	 being.	 Now	 there	 is	 no	 seeking,	 no
search.	Mahakashyap	was	right."
After	touching	the	feet	of	Gautam	Buddha,	he	touched	the	feet	of	Mahakashyap.
It	is	on	this	account	that	Mahakashyap	is	thought	to	be	the	first	Zen	master.	He
was	a	disciple	of	Buddha,	but	he	started	a	new	tradition,	of	people	who	simply
sit	silently	for	years.
You	 remember	 Basho	 --	 and	 today	 there	 are	 many	 poets	 here,	 they	 will
understand	Basho
--	perhaps	one	of	the	greatest	poets	the	world	has	produced.
SITTING	SILENTLY
DOING	NOTHING
SPRING	COMES
AND	THE	GRASS	GROWS	BY	ITSELF.
The	whole	philosophy	of	Zen	 is	 contained	 in	 this	 simple	 statement,	 this	 small
haiku.
SITTING	SILENTLY
DOING	NOTHING
SPRING	COMES
AND	THE	GRASS	GROWS	BY	ITSELF.
You	don't	have	to	do	anything.	Enlightenment	is	not	your	doing.	And	it	is	not	a
gift.	You	already	are	enlightened,	just	you	have	not	looked	in	the	right	direction.
The	 difference	 between	 the	 enlightened	 being	 and	 the	 unenlightened	 is	 not
much;	it	is	negligible.	One	has	looked	into	himself,	the	other	has	not	looked	into
himself.	This	is	not	much	of	a	difference.	At	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
68
Chapter	6	-	Be	a	rare	person
any	moment	 the	other	 can	also	 look	 into	himself.	Perhaps	when	your	eyes	are
tired	of	looking	outside,	you	close	them	in	utter	boredom	and	tiredness	and	look
inside.
You	have	searched	much	and	found	nothing	outside.	You	look	in	and	suddenly
all	that	you	were	seeking	is	already	there.	You	have	come	with	it	into	the	world,
it	is	your	intrinsic	quality.
Bankei	is	saying	that	someone	else	can	bring	the	water,	but	it	is	not	a	right	way
of	explaining	it.
He	says:
AS	FOR	THOSE	WHO	ARE	DOUBTFUL	AND	WILL	NOT	DRINK,	THERE
IS	NO
WAY	 FOR	 THEIR	 THIRST	 TO	 BE	 QUENCHED.	 BECAUSE	 I	 DID	 NOT
MEET
SOMEONE	WITH	ENLIGHTENED	EYES,	I	MISTAKENLY	WORE	MYSELF
OUT.	 I	 FINALLY	DISCOVERED	THE	BUDDHA	 IN	MY	OWN	NO-MIND,
AND	AM	TELLING
EVERYONE	 ABOUT	 THE	 BUDDHA	 OF	 THEIR	 OWN	 NO-MIND,
WITHOUT	THEM
HAVING	 TO	 DO	 ANYTHING	 DIFFICULT	 --	 JUST	 LIKE	 DRINKING
WATER	AND
HAVING	THEIR	THIRST	QUENCHED.
On	 this	 point	 I	 am	 in	 absolute	 agreement.	 Bankei	 himself	 became	 suddenly
enlightened	 although	 he	 had	 been	 trying.	 I	 have	 to	 remind	 you	 of	 Gautam
Buddha	himself.	 For	 six	 years	 continually	 he	 tried	 all	 the	methods	 and	 all	 the
disciplines	available	in	those	days,	but	nothing	happened.	He	became	so	tired,	so
utterly	bored,	that	one	full-moon	night	sitting	under	a	tree,	he	dropped	even	the
desire	for	enlightenment.	He	had	dropped	all	other	desires.	The	only	desire	that
he	had	been	carrying	for	six	years	--	on	that	full-moon	night	he	dropped	that	too.
Utterly	desireless	he	slept	a	tremendously	deep	sleep.	And	as	he	woke	up	in	the
morning,	 the	 last	 star	was	 setting,	 and	 as	 the	 last	 star	 disappeared,	 he	 became
enlightened.
It	 was	 not	 those	 six	 years	 of	 training	 that	 made	 him	 enlightened,	 it	 was	 that
relaxed	night,	that	utter	let-go.	There	was	no	desire,	no	ambition,	the	mind	had
no	function	at	all.	When	you	don't	have	any	desire,	any	ambition,	any	longing,
mind	disappears,	because	mind	is	nothing	but	a	combination	of	all	these	things.
It	is	not	an	entity	in	itself,	it	is	only	a	combination,	just	like	my	fist.	A	fist	is	not
an	entity,	it	is	just	the	five	fingers	closed.	You	open	the	fingers	and	the	fist	has
disappeared.
Mind	 is	not	 a	 reality.	 It	 is	not	 a	 fact,	 it	 is	 simply	a	combination	of	 all	desires.
Even	 a	 single	 desire	 is	 enough	 to	 keep	 it	 breathing.	 But	 when	 the	 last	 desire
drops,	 and	 that	 can	 only	 be	 the	 desire	 of	 enlightenment	 ...	 in	 the	morning	 he
woke	 up	 without	 a	 mind.	 In	 the	 morning	 he	 was	 a	 no-mind,	 so	 silent,	 so
peaceful.	 Watching	 the	 last	 star	 disappearing,	 he	 also	 watched	 himself
disappearing.	He	remained	just	a	watcher.
This	state	of	watchfulness	is	your	pure	consciousness.	And	it	 is	not	yours,	 it	 is
the	 universal	 consciousness.	 You	 can	 call	 it	 awakening,	 you	 can	 call	 it
buddhahood,	you	can	call	it	enlightenment,	names	don't	matter.
USING	THE	ENLIGHTENED	NO-MIND	INHERENT	IN	EVERYONE,	JUST
AS	 IT	 IS,	 HAVING	 FOUND	 PEACE	 AND	 BLISS,	 WITHOUT	 THE
DIFFICULTIES	OF
CONFUSION	--	IS	THIS	NOT	A	SACRED	TRUE	TEACHING?
AT	ANOTHER	TIME	SOMEONE	ASKED	BANKEI,	"IS	THE	COMPLETE
ILLUMINATION	 OF	 THE	 EYE	 OF	 REALITY	 ACCOMPLISHED	 WITH
TIME	AND
SEASON,	OR	IS	IT	REALIZED	EVEN	IN	ONE	DAY?"
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
69
Chapter	6	-	Be	a	rare	person
BANKEI	REPLIED,	"IT	IS	NOT	A	MATTER	OF	TIME	AND	SEASON;	IT	IS
ACCOMPLISHED	 ONLY	 WHEN	 THE	 EYE	 OF	 THE	 WAY	 IS	 CLEAR,
WITHOUT	ANY
GAP.	 IT	 IS	 ACCOMPLISHED	 BY	 THE	 PRACTICE	 OF	 SINGLE-MINDED
DEVOTION
TO	NURTURING	IT."
He	is	making	a	great	statement.	He	is	saying	that	it	is	not	a	question	of	time,	it	is
not	a	question	of	season.
In	my	village	one	old	priest	was	very	much	respected	as	a	wise	man.	I	used	to	go
to	him.
And	 to	 any	 question	 that	 I	 ever	 asked	 him,	 he	would	 say,	 "Wait.	At	 the	 right
time,	in	the	right	season,	you	will	find	the	answer."
I	came	back	from	the	university	and	I	went	to	see	the	old	man;	he	was	dying.	I
said	to	him,
"You	have	been	deceiving	me.	I	have	been	waiting	for	the	right	moment	and	the
right	season.
It	 has	 not	 come.	 And	 I	 want	 to	 ask	 you,	 at	 least	 while	 you	 are	 dying,	 to	 be
honest.	Tell	me,	has	your	right	time	come?"
He	had	 tears	 in	his	eyes.	He	said,	"Forgive	me,	I	used	 to	say	 that	 to	everyone,
just	 to	avoid	their	question	--	because	I	don't	know	the	answer.	I	am	myself	as
ignorant	as	anybody	but	people	think	I	am	a	wise	man,	and	by	and	by	they	have
convinced	me	that	I	am	a	wise	man.	I	too	have	started	believing	in	it."
I	said,	"At	least	now	drop	that	belief.	Die	as	ignorant	as	you	are.	Your	whole	life
you	 have	 been	 dishonest,	 but	 even	 a	 single	 moment	 before	 death,	 if	 you	 are
honest,	 perhaps	 the	 right	 time	 and	 the	 right	 season	may	 come	 suddenly."	And
actually	it	happened.	He	closed	his	eyes,	and	I	was	sitting	by	his	side	and	I	saw
the	 change	 happening	 around	 his	 energy;	 there	 was	 a	 freshness,	 a	 different
fragrance.	 His	 old	 face	 became	 so	 beautiful	 --	 wrinkled	 with	 age,	 but	 now
showing	a	maturity.
He	opened	his	eyes	and	he	took	my	hand	in	his	hand	and	he	said,	"I	cannot	be
more	 grateful	 to	 anybody	 in	my	 life	 than	 to	 you,	 although	 you	 have	 not	 done
anything.	But	seeing	the	fact	that	death	is	coming,	I	closed	my	eyes	and	for	the
first	 time	I	 looked	inwards.	It	was	 there,	 it	has	always	been	there."	He	died	an
enlightened	man.	 He	 lived	 unenlightened,	 in	misery,	 in	 suffering,	 but	 he	 died
enlightened,	in	tremendous	joy.
He	 told	 me,	 "Nobody	 should	 weep	 or	 cry;	 nobody	 should	 be	 sad	 or	 serious
because	my	death	is	an	illumination.	What	life	has	not	been	able	to	give	me,	my
death	has	given	to	me.
Celebrate!	Tell	the	people	that	my	death	has	to	be	celebrated."
And	 when	 I	 told	 the	 people,	 they	 wouldn't	 believe	 me.	 I	 said,	 "Whether	 you
believe	me	 or	 not,	 that	 old	man's	 last	 wish	 should	 be	 fulfilled.	 If	 you	 cannot
celebrate	I	will	have	to	bring	my	friends,	and	we	will	celebrate."
I	had	 to	gather	people,	and	 they	were	hesitant	because	death	 is	not	celebrated,
death	 is	 a	 calamity.	 But	 the	 death	 of	 an	 enlightened	 being,	 and	 particularly	 a
death	 which	 makes	 a	 man	 enlightened,	 has	 to	 be	 a	 festival.	 It	 is	 far	 more
valuable	than	birth.	Birth	brings	you	life.
Enlightened	death	brings	you	eternal	 life,	a	 timeless	ecstasy,	a	blissfulness	 that
never	ends.

Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked	one	question:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
I	HAVE	MET	SOMEONE	WITH	ENLIGHTENED	EYES	WHO	DOES	NOT
JUST
BRING	US	WATER	TO	DRINK,	BUT	SHOWERS	US	WITH	IT.	AND	YET,

ARE	 WE	 SO	 NEUROTIC,	 SO	 COMPLEX,	 SO	 FAR	 REMOVED	 FROM

which	 says	 that	 unless	 you	 deserve	 a	 thing,	 unless	 you	 are	 worthy	 of	 it,	 you

enlightened!	And	 I	have	not	done	anything.	 I	have	not	 tortured	myself,	 I	have
not	prayed.	I	have	not	fasted,	I	don't	know	the	scriptures."
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence

Chapter	6	-	Be	a	rare	person
But	I	say	to	you	that	for	everything	except	enlightenment	you	will	have	to	work.
If	you	want	money,	you	cannot	sit	with	closed	eyes.	If	you	sit	with	closed	eyes,
you	may	 even	 lose	money	 --	 somebody	may	 cut	 your	 pocket.	 For	money	 you
have	to	work	hard.	If	you	want	political	power,	you	have	to	work	hard.	You	have
to	be	cunning,	you	have	to	be	dishonest,	you	have	to	be	a	hypocrite.	You	have	to
use	all	kinds	of	right	or	wrong	means	to	achieve	the	end.	Only	enlightenment,	in
the	whole	phenomenon	of	existence,	is	without	any	need	to	deserve	it.
It	is	already	there.	You	can	deny	it	as	long	as	you	want,	you	can	find	excuses	as
long	as	you	want,	but	finally	you	will	be	tired	of	excuses	and	you	will	have	to
accept	it	--	"Yes,	I	am	enlightened."
It	 is	 just	 a	 totally	 different	 phenomenon.	 It	 is	 neither	 money,	 nor	 power,	 nor
prestige,	nor	reputation.	You	don't	have	to	learn	it,	you	don't	have	to	earn	it.	It	is
in	 your	 very	 heart,	 it	 is	 your	 heartbeat.	 You	 have	 just	 to	 look	 into	 your	 own
being.
Now	something	really	serious.	You	see,	Sardar	Gurudayal	Singh	already	laughs.
And	it	is	a	difficult	one,	Sardar!
Before	I	tell	the	joke,	I	have	to	tell	you	that	if	you	tell	a	joke	to	an	Englishman,
he	laughs	twice.	Once,	not	 to	look	stupid;	and	again	in	the	middle	of	 the	night
when	he	gets	it.	If	you	tell	the	same	joke	to	a	German,	he	simply	wonders	why
people	are	laughing.	My	oldest	sannyasin,	Haridas,	is	here.	He	is	from	Germany.
He	 has	 been	with	me	 almost	 for	 fifteen	 years,	 but	 even	 today	 he	 asks	 people,
"Why	 were	 you	 laughing?"	 The	 German	 mind	 has	 a	 speciality,	 it	 is	 a	 very
serious	mind.	Laughing	is	a	non-serious	affair.
If	you	 tell	 the	same	joke	 to	a	Jew,	he	will	 interrupt	you	 in	 the	middle.	He	will
say,	"Shut	up.	This	is	an	old	joke	and	moreover	you	are	telling	it	all	wrong."	It	is
very	 difficult	 to	make	 a	 Jew	 laugh	 at	 a	 joke	 because	 almost	 all	 the	 jokes	 are
Jewish.	That	is	their	monopoly.	And	the	reason	is	that	they	have	suffered	most	in
the	 world.	 Just	 to	 keep	 going,	 they	 have	 had	 to	 find	 something	 to	 laugh	 at;
otherwise	life	was	nothing	but	suffering.
Since	Moses	left	Egypt	with	his	followers	to	find	the	holy	land	in	Israel,	for	four
thousand	years	the	Jews	have	been	continuously	in	suffering.	It	has	not	stopped
for	a	single	moment.
Adolf	 Hitler	 alone	 killed	 six	 million	 Jews.	 But	 because	 of	 their	 continuous
suffering	 they	 had	 to	 invent	 something	 to	 laugh	 at,	 something	 to	 enjoy.	 There
was	nothing	in	their	life	to	laugh	about.
I	have	always	wondered	 that	 there	 is	not	a	 single	 joke	which	 is	 Indian.	 I	have
been	searching	for	a	long	time	to	find	a	single	Indian	joke,	but	it	is	because	India
has	never	 suffered.	Even	 in	 its	 poverty,	 even	 in	 its	 slavery,	 its	 religion	was	 so
much	 that	 it	 kept	 it	 patient,	 like	 opium.	 The	 rationalization	 is	 that	 you	 are
suffering	because	of	your	past	lives'	evil	acts.
The	explanation	 is	 that	 if	you	suffer	peacefully,	your	gain	 in	 the	world	beyond
life	is	going	to	be	great.
It	is	certainly	a	very	poor	phenomenon.	India	has	been	a	serious	land	of	seers,	of
saints.
You	don't	expect	a	saint	 to	 tell	a	 joke.	Can	you	imagine	Mahavira	 laughing?	It
will	be	as	strange	as	meeting	a	buffalo	laughing.	You	can	believe	in	the	buffalo,
but	you	cannot	believe	that	Mahavir	will	laugh.

Wu,	the	Chinaman,	always	eats	at	Plato	Salado's	Greek	restaurant,	because	Plato

Every	night,	Wu	comes	in,	sits	down,	and	orders	"flied	lice".	And	every	night,
Plato	collapses	laughing	when	he	hears	Wu	making	his	order.	Sometimes,	Plato
even	 tells	 all	 the	 other	 customers	 to	 be	 quiet	 and	 listen	 to	Wu	 asking	 for	 his
"flied	lice".
Finally,	 Wu	 gets	 really	 pissed	 off	 and	 decides	 to	 practice	 saying	 "fried	 rice"
correctly.
The	next	time	Wu	goes	into	Plato's	restaurant,	he	announces	very	plainly,	"Fried

not	work,	either.
"Listen,"	suggests	Percy,	"why	don't	we	both	get	on	top,	and	we	can	both	try."

5	 September	 1988	 pm	 in	 Gautam	 the	 Buddha	 Auditorium	 OUR	 BELOVED
MASTER,
TOZAN	SAID:
THE	 TEACHING	 OF	 THUSNESS	 HAS	 BEEN	 INTIMATELY
COMMUNICATED	BY
BUDDHAS	AND	PATRIARCHS.	NOW	YOU	HAVE	IT,	SO	KEEP	IT	WELL.
FILLING	 A	 SILVER	 BOWL	 WITH	 SNOW,	 HIDING	 A	 HERON	 IN	 THE
MOONLIGHT
--	WHEN	YOU	ARRAY	THEM,	THEY	ARE	NOT	THE	SAME.	WHEN	YOU
MIX	THEM,	YOU	KNOW	WHERE	THEY	ARE.	THE	MEANING	IS	NOT	IN
THE	WORDS,	YET	IT
RESPONDS	 TO	 THE	 INQUIRING	 IMPULSE.	 IF	 YOU	ARE	 EXCITED,	 IT
BECOMES	 A	 PITFALL;	 IF	 YOU	 MISS	 IT,	 YOU	 FALL	 INTO
RETROSPECTIVE	HESITATION.
TURNING	AWAY	AND	TOUCHING	ARE	BOTH	WRONG,	FOR	IT	IS	LIKE
A	MASS
OF	FIRE.	JUST	TO	DEPICT	IT	IN	LITERARY	FORM	IS	TO	RELEGATE	IT
TO
DEFILEMENT.
IT	IS	BRIGHT	JUST	AS	MIDNIGHT.	 IT	DOESN'T	APPEAR	AT	DAWN.	IT
ACTS	AS
A	GUIDE	FOR	BEINGS	--	ITS	USE	REMOVES	ALL	PAIN.
ALTHOUGH	IT	IS	NOT	FABRICATED,	IT	IS	NOT	WITHOUT	SPEECH.	IT
IS	LIKE
FACING	 A	 JEWEL	 MIRROR:	 FORM	 AND	 IMAGE	 BEHOLD	 EACH
OTHER.	YOU	ARE
NOT	IT,	IT	ACTUALLY	IS	YOU.
IT	IS	LIKE	A	BABE	IN	THE	WORLD,	IN	FIVE	ASPECTS	COMPLETE.	IT
DOES	NOT
GO	OR	COME,	NOR	RISE	NOR	STAND.
ULTIMATELY	 IT	 DOES	 NOT	 APPREHEND	 ANYTHING,	 BECAUSE	 ITS
SPEECH	IS
NOT	YET	CORRECT.	IT	IS	LIKE	THE	SIX	LINES	OF	THE	DOUBLE	SPLIT
HEXAGRAM:	THE	RELATIVE	AND	ABSOLUTE	INTEGRATE.	PILED	UP,
THEY
MAKE	THREE;	 THE	COMPLETE	TRANSFORMATION	MAKES	 FIVE.	 IT
IS	LIKE	THE
TASTE	 OF	 THE	 FIVE-FLAVORED	 HERB,	 LIKE	 THE	 DIAMOND
THUNDERBOLT.
Maneesha,	Zen	is	more	like	poetry,	like	music,	like	dance.	It	is	not	a	philosophy;
hence,	no	conceptual	thinking	can	comprehend	it.	Mind	is	absolutely	impotent	as
far	as	Zen	is	concerned.	You	have	to	go	beyond	mind	to	have	some	taste	of	Zen.
Going	beyond	the	mind	simply	means	dropping	all	thoughts,	creating	a	vacuum	-
-	a	nothingness.	But	that	nothingness	is	not	empty;	it	is	just	like	the	sky.	It	is	full
of	nothingness.
And	 when	 your	 eyes	 are	 without	 any	 dust	 and	 your	 mind	 is	 without	 any
thoughts,	you	see	clearly,	straight	into	reality.	It	is	not	a	question	of	belief.	You
don't	 have	 to	 believe	what	 you	will	 be	 seeing,	 you	 have	 simply	 to	 clean	 your
inner	 eye,	 your	 vision,	 and	 the	 reality	 will	 appear	 on	 its	 own	 accord,	 not
according	 to	 anybody's	 belief.	 Hence,	 those	 who	 have	 beliefs	 never	 attain	 to
reality.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
77
Chapter	7	-	Now	you	have	it
I	 am	making	 a	 statement	 against	 all	 religions.	 They	 are	 all	 based	 on	 belief	 --
believe	 first,	 then	 you	 will	 know.	 But	 once	 you	 believe	 you	 have	 closed	 the
doors	 of	 inquiry,	 once	 you	 believe	 you	 have	 accepted	 your	 ignorance,	 your
blindness.	 You	 have	 accepted	 that	 somebody	 else	 has	 known	 --	 "What	 is	 the
need	 for	 me	 to	 know?	 I	 have	 just	 to	 believe	 in	 Jesus	 Christ	 or	 Krishna	 or
Buddha."	But	when	Buddha	drinks	 the	water,	 your	 thirst	 is	 not	 quenched;	 and
when	 Jesus	 eats,	 your	 hunger	 does	 not	 disappear.	 Even	 these	 ordinary	 things,
mundane,	you	have	to	experience	individually	--	what	to	say	about	the	ultimate
experience?	And	Zen	is	the	name	of	the	ultimate	experience.
You	cannot	depend	on	anybody.	You	cannot	believe	anybody's	experience.	You
have	to	drop	all	beliefs,	all	thoughts,	all	philosophies,	all	religions,	and	you	have
to	go,	utterly	innocent,	inside	your	own	being.
From	there	the	door	opens	and	life	takes	a	new	color,	a	new	radiance,	a	new	joy.
Your	 words	 are	 no	 more	 empty,	 they	 contain	 overflowing	 significance.	 Your
gestures	 become	meaningful	 for	 the	 first	 time.	 Your	 actions	 have	 a	 poetry	 of
their	 own.	 Your	 very	 movement	 is	 a	 dance	 because	 you	 have	 known	 the
innermost	blissfulness.	It	starts	overflowing	you	in	your	actions,	in	your	words,
in	your	silences.	It	starts	overflowing	and	reaching	to	others.	You	become	almost
a	fountain,	showering	all	around.
Or	you	can	say	you	become	a	beautiful	lotus	spreading,	radiating	its	perfume	all
over	 the	 space;	whether	 anybody	 is	 there	 or	 not	 is	 not	 the	 point.	 Even	 in	 the
faraway	forest	the	rose	will	spread	its	joy,	its	fragrance.	Perhaps	a	passer-by	may
be	enriched	by	it,	but	it	is	not	the	point,	whether	anybody	gets	it	or	not.
When	 truth	 is	 realized,	 the	 overflowing	 of	 it	 is	 intrinsic.	 This	 you	 have	 to
understand	before	I	take	up	Tozan,	because	Tozan	is	one	of	the	great	masters.	All
his	 statements	 are	 just	 an	 overflowing	 of	 his	 experience;	 he	 is	 not	 quoting
scriptures,	he	is	simply	sharing	his	experience.
And	whenever	 somebody	 is	 sharing	his	own	experience	 it	 is	not	 a	question	of
belief	or	not
--	 just	 enjoy	 it.	 Perhaps	 in	 your	 enjoyment	 you	 may	 get	 some	 glimpse,	 very
invisible	...	some	click,	not	available	to	the	outside	world.	Perhaps	for	a	moment
the	heartbeat	stops,	or	takes	a	totally	different	rhythm.
If	Zen	was	a	philosophy	it	would	be	very	easy	to	convey	it.	If	it	was	a	religion	it
would	not	be	difficult	--	there	are	thousands	of	scriptures	depicting	religion.	But
it	is	something	more	miraculous	than	anything	else	in	the	world.	You	can	taste	it,
you	can	drink	it,	you	can	relish	it,	you	can	dance	out	of	sheer	joy,	but	you	cannot
say	it.
That	is	the	only	difficulty	with	Zen	--	you	cannot	say	it.	And	unfortunately	man
has	 become	 too	 much	 language-oriented;	 he	 has	 forgotten	 other	 ways	 of
communication.	 There	 are	many	 other	 ways	 of	 communication.	 The	 idea	 that
language	is	the	only	way	of	communication	has	made	humanity	very	poor,	very
prosaic.	It	has	lost	the	mystery	of	poetry,	it	has	lost	the	meaningless,	but	utterly
significant,	music	of	existence.	Now	dance	has	become	a	discipline,	outwardly
practiced,	rehearsed,	but	not	something	growing	from	within	you	and	spreading
out.
Discussing	Tozan,	you	will	have	to	remember	that	he	is	trying	his	best	to	say	that
which	 cannot	 be	 said.	 Every	 master	 has	 tried	 to	 say	 it;	 nobody	 has	 ever
succeeded.	One	wonders	why,	if	it	cannot	be	said,	why	people	should	try	to	say
it.	One	of	 the	most	prominent	philosophers	of	 the	modern	world,	Wittgenstein,
has	written	perhaps	the	most	profound	book	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
78
Chapter	7	-	Now	you	have	it
of	this	century.	In	one	of	his	books,	TRACTATUS,	he	comes	to	the	point	where
he	is	almost	turning	into	a	mystic.	He	says,	"That	which	cannot	be	said	should
not	be	said."
I	was	 a	 student	 --	 he	was	 alive	 --	 and	 I	wrote	 him	 a	 letter	 saying,	 "You	 have
contradicted	 yourself:	 'That	which	 cannot	 be	 said	 should	 not	 be	 said.'	You	 are
also	saying	something	about	it."
He	must	 have	 been	 a	man	 of	 tremendous	 honesty;	 immediately	 a	 letter	 came
with	an	apology.	He	said,	 "It	 is	 true.	 I	never	 thought	about	 it,	 that	even	 to	say
that	nothing	should	be	said,	you	have	already	said	something."
One	 has	 to	 understand	 that	 all	 the	 mystics	 of	 the	 world	 have	 been	 in	 a
tremendous	difficulty.	They	know	it	cannot	be	said,	but	still	they	say	--	they	try
at	least	their	best.	My	own	understanding	is,	it	cannot	be	said	but	it	can	be	heard.
That	is	the	reason	why	the	mystics	go	on	speaking,	knowing	perfectly	well	it	is
not	 possible	 to	 put	 it	 into	 language,	 but	 hoping	 that	 somebody	 may	 hear	 it
between	the	words,	between	the	lines,	in	the	gestures,	in	the	eyes	of	the	master,
in	his	presence,	in	his	intimacy.
Perhaps	just	as	a	flame	can	jump	to	another	unlit	candle	if	you	bring	them	close
enough,	 intimate	 enough	 ...	 The	 master's	 work	 is	 to	 bring	 the	 disciple	 close
enough	 to	his	 inner	 flame,	which	 is	a	 fire.	Because	 it	 is	a	 fire,	only	 the	daring
ones	come	very	close	to	the	master,	because	it	is	going	to	burn	you	completely
and	utterly.	It	is	going	to	be	your	death	--	and	a	resurrection.
The	 old,	 ancient	 Sanskrit	 scriptures	 say	 that	 the	master	 is	 a	 death,	 but	 that	 is
incomplete.
The	master	is	also	the	eternal	life,	beyond	death.	But	of	course,	first	comes	the
death.	The	disciple	comes	close	to	the	master	and	dies	into	his	fire,	into	his	love,
and	is	resurrected	in	a	totally	new	being:	fresh,	innocent,	and	a	child	of	eternity.
That's	what	Tozan's	first	statement	is.
TOZAN	SAID:
THE	 TEACHING	 OF	 THUSNESS	 HAS	 BEEN	 INTIMATELY
COMMUNICATED	BY
BUDDHAS	AND	PATRIARCHS.	NOW	YOU	HAVE	IT,	SO	KEEP	IT	WELL.
Every	word	is	so	full	of	significance.
THE	TEACHING	OF	THUSNESS	...
It	is	a	very	strange	way,	particularly	for	people	who	are	not	acquainted	with	the
world	of	Zen.	Thusness	is	as	important,	or	perhaps	more	important,	than	the	so-
called	 gods	 of	 all	 your	 religions.	 'Thusness'	 means	 this	 moment	 your	 silent
existence	is	all	there	is	to	discover.
Its	splendor	is	great,	but	you	will	have	to	pay	for	it.	You	will	have	to	pay	for	it
with	your	mind,	with	your	personality.	You	will	have	to	go	beyond	your	facade,
your	 so-called	 cultured	 personality,	 your	 knowledge	 cultivated	 by	 others	 and
from	others.	You	will	have	to	lose	all	this	garbage	...	you	will	have	to	be	utterly
empty.	 In	 that	 emptiness	 you	 will	 feel	 for	 the	 first	 time	 the	 experience	 of
thusness.
Thusness	 can	 also	 be	 translated	 as	 'thisness'.	 It	 can	 also	 be	 translated	 as
'suchness'.	The	original	word	used	by	Gautam	Buddha	 is	 tathata.	 Just	being	 in
the	moment	--	no	past,	no	future	--	just	being	here,	one-pointed,	and	the	door	of
all	the	mysteries	of	existence	opens.
The	teaching	of	thusness	is	the	teaching	of	all	the	great	masters,	and	it	has	been
intimately	communicated	because	there	is	no	other	way.	I	am	communicating	it
this	very	moment,	but	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
79
Chapter	7	-	Now	you	have	it
not	 through	my	words,	 in	 the	 silences,	 in	 the	gaps.	When	you	 feel	 simply	 this
moment	 in	 its	 utter	 purity,	 you	 have	 become	 intimate	with	 all	 the	 buddhas	 --
past,	present,	future.
The	word	'buddha'	is	very	significant;	it	means	one	who	has	attained	to	thusness.
Just	because	of	thusness,	Buddha's	other	name	is	Tathagat.	'Tathagat'	means	one
who	lives	moment	 to	moment,	who	knows	nothing	of	 the	past	and	who	knows
nothing	of	the	future,	who	is	utterly	settled	and	centered	here	and	now.
The	 moment	 you	 are	 centered	 here	 and	 now	 you	 are	 an	 intimate	 of	 all	 the
buddhas.	The	moment	you	are	intimate	with	reality,	obviously	you	are	intimate
with	all	the	masters	and	all	the	mystics.
This	very	moment	you	are	connected	with	existence,	but	you	go	on	roaming	in
the	mind	and	you	completely	forget	that	behind	the	mind	and	beyond	the	mind
there	is	a	witness	which	is	watching	silently.	You	come	across	these	experiences
every	day	but	you	don't	take	much	note	of	it.
For	example,	I	was	a	student	of	a	Mohammedan	teacher	and	he	was	very	strict;
he	was	known	in	the	school	as	the	most	strict	person.	The	first	day	of	his	class	he
entered	and	said	to	us,	"I	want	you	to	remember	always,	don't	ask	me	for	leave
because	you	are	having	a	headache	or	stomachache.	Anything	that	I	cannot	see,	I
don't	believe."	Students	do	that	continuously:	"I	have	a	headache	so	I	want	to	go
home."
That	very	evening	...	He	used	to	go	for	an	evening	walk,	and	just	in	front	of	his
house	there	were	two	kadamb	trees,	very	beautiful	trees,	so	I	waited	in	one	tree
with	a	big	rock	in	my	hand.	He	returned	--	it	was	getting	dark	--	and	I	dropped
the	rock	on	his	head.	He	freaked	out.
I	said,	"Shut	up!	Now	do	you	believe	in	headaches?"
He	 looked	 at	 me	 surprised,	 a	 little	 bit	 shocked.	 He	 said,	 "Listen,	 we	 can
negotiate.	If	you	have	a	headache	just	raise	one	finger	and	I	will	allow	you	to	go
out,	but	don't	make	it	a	public	thing.	I	will	not	say	anything	about	this	rock	that
you	have	thrown	on	me.	It	is	a	compromise."
I	said,	"I	never	compromise.	In	the	first	place,	I	don't	believe	that	you	have	been
hurt."
He	said,	"You	are	strange	..."
I	said,	"You	are	strange.	Remember	in	the	morning,	at	the	beginning	of	the	class,
you	said	you	don't	believe	in	headaches?	I	am	going	to	make	this	incident	public
knowledge."
But	 it	 is	something	far	more	important	 than	just	an	 incident.	When	you	have	a
headache,	 how	 do	 you	 know?	 There	must	 be	 a	watcher	 behind	 the	 head	who
knows	the	headache.	The	headache	itself	cannot	know;	there	must	be	a	witness,
a	 watcher,	 who	 knows	 the	 headache,	 who	 knows	 the	 stomachache,	 who	 feels
emotions	and	can	watch	those	emotions.
When	you	are	full	of	anger,	if	you	sit	down	and	watch	you	can	watch	the	anger
clouds	 all	 around	 you,	 dark.	 When	 you	 are	 in	 love	 you	 can	 watch	 a	 certain
perfume,	a	certain	beauty,	a	certain	blissfulness	all	around	you.	Every	moment	in
ordinary	life	you	are	coming	across	the	witness	but	you	have	never	recognized	it,
you	have	 just	not	 taken	note	of	 it.	At	 this	very	moment	 I	am	speaking	 to	you,
you	are	hearing	me.	Just	look	a	little	more	back	--	there	is	a	witness	who	knows
that	you	are	hearing.	That	witness	is	your	eternity.
"By	all	 these	mystics,	 the	message	has	been	conveyed	 intimately"	means,	 they
have	brought	people	closer	to	them.	All	their	words	are	nothing	but	fishermen's
nets.	Through	their	words	they	bring	you	closer.	If	their	words	trigger	something
in	you,	you	feel	pulled,	magnetized,	and	 the	closer	you	come	 the	 less	you	are.
And	when	you	have	become	really	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
80
Chapter	7	-	Now	you	have	it
intimate,	you	disappear	--	you,	as	you	have	known	yourself	--	and	the	one	who	is
behind,	who	you	had	never	taken	note	of,	comes	in	front.	For	the	first	time	you
know	you	are	only	a	witnessing	consciousness,	everything	else	is	a	clothing.
Your	 inner	 center,	 which	 is	 the	 connecting	 link	 with	 the	 universal	 heart	 from
where	you	get	your	 life,	your	 love,	your	 joy,	 is	 to	be	found	in	witnessing.	The
master	is	a	witness.
Becoming	 intimate	with	 him,	 the	 fire	 of	witnessing	 simply	 jumps	 in	 a	 single,
instantaneous	moment.	Where	there	was	all	dark	suddenly	becomes	light;	where
there	was	all	misery	suddenly	becomes	a	tremendous	joy	overflowing	you,	and	a
great	longing	arises	in	you.
Just	as	before	you	wanted	more	money,	more	power,	more	prestige,	now	there	is
only	one	 longing	--	how	to	spread	 this	 fire.	Because	unless	a	person	 is	burned
completely,	all	his	falsities	gone,	he	will	never	know	the	beauty	and	the	truth	and
the	splendor	of	existence,	which	was	available	to	him	every	moment.
THE	 TEACHING	 OF	 THUSNESS	 HAS	 BEEN	 INTIMATELY
COMMUNICATED	BY
BUDDHAS.	NOW	YOU	HAVE	IT	...
Tozan	must	be	talking	to	his	disciples.
I	 am	 saying	 to	 you,	 you	 have	 it.	 I	 am	not	 simply	 reading	Tozan.	On	my	 own
accord	 I	 am	 saying	 to	 you:	 you	 have	 it.	Take	 note	 of	 it	 and	 don't	 forget	 it.	 In
ordinary	life	go	on	remembering	that	you	are	a	buddha.	Nothing	else	is	needed,
this	 very	 remembrance	 that	 you	 are	 a	 buddha	 is	 going	 to	 transform	 all	 your
activities.
I	 am	 reminded	of	 a	 great	mystic,	Nagarjuna.	He	used	 to	 live	 naked,	 and	 even
kings	and	queens	used	to	touch	his	feet.	He	was	absolutely	a	beggar	--	he	had	not
even	a	begging	bowl.
So	 while	 he	 was	 visiting	 the	 capital	 the	 queen	 presented	 him	 with	 a	 golden
begging	bowl	studded	with	diamonds.	With	tears	she	asked	him	not	to	reject	it.
Nagarjuna	said,	"I	will	not	reject	 it,	 I	will	not	hurt	your	feelings,	but	 it	will	be
very	difficult	for	me	to	keep	it	for	long	--	a	naked	man,	and	I	have	to	sleep	also.
Anybody	can	steal	it.	I	sleep	under	the	sky,	I	sleep	under	a	tree	...	It	is	not	going
to	be	with	me	for	long."
But	 the	queen	 said,	 "It	does	not	matter,	 I	will	prepare	another	better	 than	 this.
Now	it	is	a	question	of	my	prestige.	So	if	it	is	lost,	whenever	I	see	you	again	you
will	get	another."
Nagarjuna	said,	"I	have	no	objection."
A	thief	was	hearing	all	this	and	said,	"My	god.	A	golden	bowl	worth	millions	of
rupees,	studded	with	diamonds,	and	this	naked	man	...	it	is	absolutely	unsuitable,
it	does	not	fit."	So	he	followed	Nagarjuna	thinking,	"Let	this	fellow	go	to	sleep
..."	Nagarjuna	was	staying	in	ruins	outside	the	town	where	doors	were	missing,
where	walls	had	fallen	--	and	this	thief	was	hiding	behind	a	wall.
Nagarjuna	was	watching	--	"Somebody	is	following	me.	Obviously	he	cannot	be
following	me	to	these	ruins.	He	must	be	following	for	the	begging	bowl."	Then
he	 saw	 the	 thief	 hiding	behind	 a	wall.	He	 threw	 the	begging	bowl	outside	 the
window	and	told	the	man,	"Take	it.	I	will	not	force	you	to	become	a	thief,	I	give
it	to	you	as	a	gift."
Do	you	 see	 how	 the	 buddhas	 behave?	 "I	will	 not	 force	 you	 to	 become	 a	 thief
because	that	will	be	my	crime,	not	your	crime.	I	give	it	to	you	as	a	gift.	Just	take
it	 and	 run	 away."	 The	man	 could	 not	 run	 away,	 could	 not	 believe	 it.	 He	was
almost	 frozen.	 He	 had	 never	 seen	 such	 a	 man,	 who	 can	 throw	 a	 thing	 worth
millions	of	rupees	just	as	if	it	is	nothing,	and	he	is	saving	him	from	being	a	thief.
He	is	giving	it	to	him	as	he	would	give	a	friend	a	gift.

Chapter	7	-	Now	you	have	it
Something	triggered	in	the	thief's	heart.	He	said,	"Can	I	come	inside	and	touch
your	feet	and	sit	by	your	side	just	for	a	few	minutes?	I	have	never	seen	such	a
man	like	you."
Nagarjuna	said	to	him,	"That	was	exactly	the	purpose	of	throwing	the	bowl,	to
bring	you	in.	Come	in,	sit	down."
He	followed	everything.	He	asked	Nagarjuna,	"How	could	you	manage	to	throw
such	a	precious	thing?	I	am	a	thief,	to	be	honest.	I	cannot	be	dishonest	to	a	man
like	you.	And	you	have	been	so	compassionate	 that	you	don't	want	me	to	be	a
thief,	but	that	is	my	profession."
Nagarjuna	said,	"There	is	no	harm,	you	continue	to	be	a	thief.	Just	remember	one
thing,	that	you	are	a	buddha."
He	said,	"My	god,	I	am	a	thief	and	you	are	telling	me	to	remember	that	I	am	a
buddha!"
Nagarjuna	 said,	 "This	 is	 enough.	You	 just	 try,	 and	 I	 am	going	 to	 stay	 for	 two
weeks.	 You	 can	 come	 anytime,	 day	 or	 night,	 to	 give	 me	 the	 result,	 what
happens."
After	 the	 third	 day	 he	 was	 there	 with	 the	 begging	 bowl,	 asking	 Nagarjuna,
"Please	take	it	back;	otherwise	I	will	be	murdered.	Now	the	whole	town	knows
that	I	have	got	it.	I	have	been	hiding	it	here	and	there	but	it	can	be	protected	only
by	a	queen	or	a	king."
Nagarjuna	said,	"You	leave	it	here,	it	is	not	important.	What	is	important	is,	what
happened	to	the	discipline	I	had	given	to	you?"
He	 said,	 "You	have	given	me	 a	 tremendous	discipline.	 I	 first	 thought,	 'It	 is	 so
easy	 just	 to	 remember	 that	 I	 am	 a	 buddha.'	 But	 you	 are	 very	 clever,	 because
when	I	went	to	steal	something,	just	the	remembrance	that	'I	am	a	buddha'	and	I
would	get	frozen,	my	hands	would	not	move	to	take	anything.	For	three	days	I
have	not	stolen	a	single	thing.	This	is	unprecedented	in	my	life.	And	I	don't	think
that	again	I	will	be	able	to	steal.	This	is	a	dangerous	thing	you	have	said	to	me,
because	the	moment	I	find	an	opportunity	to	steal	something,	the	remembrance
that	 I	am	a	buddha	 ...	 I	 simply	 relax,	 I	escape	 --	 it	 is	not	 right	 for	a	buddha.	 I
cannot	let	you	down	or	let	the	buddha	down."
Nagarjuna	 said,	 "That	 is	 your	 problem.	 But	 take	 this	 begging	 bowl	 because
somebody	will	take	it,	and	it	does	not	matter	who	takes	it."
He	 said,	 "Forget	 all	 about	 it.	 Just	 as	 you	 remember,	 I	 also	 remember:	 I	 am	 a
buddha."
The	 very	 remembrance	 of	who	you	 are	 is	 going	 to	 transform	your	whole	 life.
You	 cannot	 do	 anything	 against	 your	 consciousness.	 You	 have	 been	 doing	 it
because	you	have	been	unaware.	The	only	secret	is	to	achieve	a	recognition	that
inside	you	there	is	a	witnessing	self.
The	name	of	the	witnessing	self	is	the	buddha.	In	every	act,	in	every	word,	just
remember	your	inner	being	--	its	blissfulness,	its	silence,	its	grandeur,	its	eternity
--	and	you	cannot	be	the	same	man.
This	 is	 called	 the	 transmission	 of	 the	 lamp.	 It	 happens	 in	 the	 intimacy	 of	 the
master	and	the	disciple.	Nothing	is	said	but	something	is	understood.	The	very
energy	of	the	master,	the	very	presence	simply	penetrates	you	and	awakens	you,
brings	you	out	of	your	dreams	and	your	sleep.	That	is	the	meaning	of	the	word
'buddha':	one	who	is	awake.
NOW	YOU	HAVE	IT,	SO	KEEP	IT	WELL.

RESPONDS	 TO	 THE	 INQUIRING	 IMPULSE.	 IF	 YOU	ARE	 EXCITED,	 IT
BECOMES	 A	 PITFALL;	 IF	 YOU	 MISS	 IT,	 YOU	 FALL	 INTO
RETROSPECTIVE	HESITATION.
TURNING	AWAY	AND	TOUCHING	ARE	BOTH	WRONG,	FOR	IT	IS	LIKE
A	MASS
OF	FIRE.
When	you	go	in,	you	are	entering	into	a	mass	of	fire.	Touching	it	is	dangerous.
Turning	away	from	it	is	dangerous.	Just	remembering	it,	that	your	inner	world	is
not	dark	but	is	radiant	with	thousands	of	suns,	is	going	to	transform	your	life	in
every	detail.
JUST	 TO	 DEPICT	 IT	 IN	 LITERARY	 FORM	 IS	 TO	 RELEGATE	 IT	 TO
DEFILEMENT.
IT	IS	BRIGHT	JUST	AS	MIDNIGHT.	 IT	DOESN'T	APPEAR	AT	DAWN.	IT
ACTS	AS
A	GUIDE	FOR	BEINGS	--	ITS	USE	REMOVES	ALL	PAIN.
ALTHOUGH	IT	IS	NOT	FABRICATED,	IT	IS	NOT	WITHOUT	SPEECH.	IT
IS	LIKE
FACING	 A	 JEWEL	 MIRROR:	 FORM	 AND	 IMAGE	 BEHOLD	 EACH
OTHER.	YOU	ARE
NOT	IT,	IT	ACTUALLY	IS	YOU.
When	you	are	 facing	a	mirror,	you	see	yourself	 in	 the	mirror.	Tozan	 is	saying,
YOU	ARE	NOT	IT,	IT	ACTUALLY	IS	YOU.
It	 is	 a	 complicated	 phenomenon.	When	 you	 stand	 before	 a	mirror,	 one	 ray	 of
light	is	going	towards	the	mirror,	making	your	reflection	in	the	mirror;	another
ray	 is	coming	towards	you	so	 that	you	can	witness	 that	 the	mirror	 is	 reflecting
you.
But	 you	 are	 neither	 the	 reflected	 one	 nor	 the	 reflection.	 You	 are	 the	 witness,
which	no	mirror	can	reflect.	A	witness	is	always	simply	a	witness.	It	cannot	be
anything,	not	even	a	reflection.
IT	IS	LIKE	A	BABE	IN	THE	WORLD,	IN	FIVE	ASPECTS	COMPLETE.	IT
DOES	NOT
GO	OR	COME,	NOR	RISE	NOR	STAND.
It	 simply	 is.	 It	 neither	goes	nor	 comes,	 it	 is	neither	born	nor	dies,	 it	 is	neither
young	 nor	 old,	 it	 is	 neither	 man	 nor	 woman.	 It	 is	 simply	 a	 pure	 witnessing,
watching.
You	 cannot	 go	 behind	 it,	 or	 beyond	 it.	You	 cannot	watch	 your	 own	watching.
That	will	create	a	logical	regress	--	what	they	call	in	logic	'infinite	regression'.	If
you	 say	 that	 you	 can	watch	 your	watcher,	 that	means	watcher	 number	 one	 is
being	watched	by	watcher	number	two
--	what	about	number	 three?	Where	are	you	going	 to	stop?	Wherever	you	will
stop	 ...	 you	 will	 have	 to	 stop	 somewhere.	 You	 will	 get	 tired	 --	 millions	 and
trillions,	all	watching	the	next.
Finally	you	will	have	to	say	that	"This	is	the	last."	But	why	go	so	far	away?	The
first	is	the	last!	You	cannot	go	behind	it.
Have	you	seen	small	children	when	for	 the	first	 time	they	see	a	mirror?	If	you
have	not,	you	can	do	the	experiment.	A	small	child	who	cannot	stand	up	yet	and
moves	 on	 all	 fours,	 just	 put	 a	 mirror	 in	 front	 of	 him.	 First	 he	 will	 be	 very
inquiring	--	the	fellow	is	there	...	He	cannot	think	that	it	is	his	own	reflection;	he
has	never	seen	his	own	reflection.	He	does	not	know	that	mirrors	exist.
First	he	will	try	to	touch	the	fellow.	But	it	is	strange,	the	fellow	also	touches	him.
He	 laughs,	 the	 fellow	 laughs;	he	mimics,	 the	 fellow	mimics.	A	strange	 fellow!
And	when	he	touches	there	is	nothing	but	glass.	Without	exception,	every	child
is	going	to	have	a	look	behind	the	mirror	--	where	is	the	other	child	hiding?	He
will	crawl	around	the	side	and	look	behind.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence

Chapter	7	-	Now	you	have	it
A	Mulla	Nasruddin	story	...	By	the	side	of	the	road	he	found	a	small	mirror.	He
looked	 into	 it,	 and	 he	 said,	 "My	 god,	 this	 looks	 like	 my	 father.	 I	 had	 never
thought	 that	 he	 is	 so	 fashionable."	He	 could	 not	 conceive	 that	 it	was	 his	 own
reflection,	he	had	never	seen	a	mirror	before	--	this	was	the	first	encounter.
And	of	course	it	looked	...	the	only	way	for	him	to	conceive	it	was,	it	looked	like
his	father.	His	father	was	dead;	he	himself	had	become	very	old.	It	really	looked
like	his	father.
But	 he	 said,	 "I	 have	 never	 thought	 that	 he	 is	 so	 fashionable.	 He	 was	 a	 very
traditional	man,	 very	 orthodox.	But	 anyway,	 it	 is	 good	 I	 have	 found	 it.	 I	will
keep	it	as	his	memory."
So	he	came	home,	but	he	did	not	want	his	wife	to	know	about	it.	But	no	man	has
ever	been	able	 to	hide	anything	 from	his	wife.	 Just	by	 the	way	he	entered	 the
wife	said,	"It	seems	you	have	done	something	wrong."
He	said,	"My	god,	I	have	not	done	anything	wrong."
She	said,	"I	will	see.	Your	face	seems	to	be	that	of	a	guilty	man."
He	went	upstairs	and	put	the	mirror	in	an	old	trunk.	And	when	he	had	gone	out
for	work	the	wife	went	up,	opened	the	box	and	took	out	the	mirror.	She	looked
into	 it	 and	 she	 said,	 "My	 god.	 So,	 he	 is	 having	 a	 love	 affair	 with	 some	 ugly
looking,	tattered	woman.	Now	let	him	come	back	..."
If	you	have	never	seen	a	mirror,	 it	 is	obvious	 --	you	cannot	 immediately	 think
that	it	is	your	reflection.
A	 drunkard	 came	 home.	 Not	 to	 create	 trouble,	 he	 went	 very	 silently	 into	 his
wife's	room.
He	had	to	go	to	the	bathroom,	so	he	went	into	the	bathroom	and	there	he	saw	in
the	 mirror	 that	 his	 face	 had	 scratches	 and	 blood	 on	 it,	 because	 he	 had	 been
fighting	in	the	pub.
He	said,	"This	is	going	to	be	troublesome	in	the	morning.	When	the	wife	sees	it,
I	will	be	caught	red-handed."	So	he	tried	somehow	to	hide	those	scratches,	but
he	 could	 not	 find	 anything	 other	 than	 a	 lipstick.	He	managed	 to	 cover	 all	 the
scratches	and	was	very	happy	at	his	success.
In	the	early	morning,	when	the	wife	went	into	the	bathroom,	she	shouted,	"Who
is	 the	person	 ...?	It	must	be	you,	you	idiot!	You	destroyed	my	lipstick	and	you
have	destroyed	the	mirror."	Because	he	had	made	all	 those	lines	on	the	mirror,
where	his	face	had	been.	This	face	was	in	a	drunken	state.	Even	that	much	was	a
great	intelligence,	to	find	that	this	is	his	face.
We	 are	 all	 drunk,	 almost	 living	 in	 sleepiness.	 Our	 actions	 go	 wrong;	 our
intentions	 go	 wrong;	 our	 life	 becomes	 a	 misery,	 a	 pain,	 an	 anguish.	 But	 the
ultimate	 reason	 and	 cause	 is	 that	we	 are	 not	 aware	 of	 our	 being.	 Just	 a	 single
thing	contains	all	the	essence	of	all	the	religions:	awareness	of	oneself.	And	then
you	cannot	do	anything	wrong.
ULTIMATELY	 IT	 DOES	 NOT	 APPREHEND	 ANYTHING,	 BECAUSE	 ITS
SPEECH	IS
NOT	YET	CORRECT.	IT	IS	LIKE	THE	SIX	LINES	OF	THE	DOUBLE	SPLIT
HEXAGRAM:	THE	RELATIVE	AND	ABSOLUTE	INTEGRATE.	PILED	UP,
THEY
MAKE	THREE;	 THE	COMPLETE	TRANSFORMATION	MAKES	 FIVE.	 IT
IS	LIKE	THE
TASTE	 OF	 THE	 FIVE-FLAVORED	 HERB,	 LIKE	 THE	 DIAMOND
THUNDERBOLT.
The	Zen	experience	is	certainly	a	diamond	thunderbolt.	It	comes	like	lightning,
and	suddenly	everything	that	was	dark	becomes	light.	And	once	you	have	seen
yourself,	you	cannot	forget,	even	if	you	want	to.	Have	you	tried	one	thing:	can
you	forget	your	name?	Just	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence

try.	The	more	you	try	to	forget	it,	the	more	you	will	remember	it,	because	each
time,	to	forget	you	have	to	remember.
We	have	never	 looked	in.	Once	you	look	in,	a	 lightning	thunderbolt	 ...	and	the
recognition	of	the	face	of	the	buddha	within	you,	your	original	face.	Then	even	if
you	want	 to	 forget	 it	 you	cannot.	Once	a	buddha,	 forever	 a	buddha.	 It	 is	 your
essential	 self.	 It	 is	 not	 an	 achievement;	 it	 is	 not	 something	 far	 away,	 that	 you
have	to	travel	to	get	it.	It	is	just	a	question	of	looking	in,	where	you	have	never
looked	before.
All	our	meditations	are	devoted	to	a	single	thing,	looking	in.

Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
85
Chapter	7	-	Now	you	have	it
THOSE	 DIAMOND	 THUNDERBOLTS	 YOU	 HURTLE	 AROUND	 YOU
WHEN	YOU
DANCE	 WITH	 US	 EACH	 EVENING	 --	 AT	 THE	 RATE	 WE'RE	 GOING,
SOMEONE
COULD	BE	KNOCKED	CONSCIOUS!
BUT	PLEASE,	DON'T	STOP!
Maneesha,	I	want	you	all	to	be	knocked	conscious.	But	you	are	so	clever,	such
accomplished	actors	that	you	even	act	meditation.	You	follow	Nivedano's	drum
just	like	actors.	Nivedano	drums	and	you	start	your	gibberish	just	as	if	you	are	a
robot,	just	waiting	for	Nivedano	to	push	the	button.	But	you	are	not	total.	If	you
are	total,	it	will	not	be	acting	anymore.
You	do,	and	you	try	to	be	total,	but	trying	will	not	help	--	you	have	to	be	total.	I
can	hear	and	I	can	see:	people	are	trying	to	do,	in	every	possible	way,	but	they
know	inside	that	it	is	all	acting.	That's	where	they	miss	the	point.
Make	it	a	reality,	throw	out	all	your	garbage.	Don't	say	relevant	things;	that	you
are	doing	every	day,	the	whole	day.	Just	for	two	minutes,	go	crazy	without	any
fear.	When	you	are	going	crazy	yourself,	you	can	come	back	any	moment.	When
Nivedano	beats	his	drum	you	will	become	silent.
But	remember	one	thing:	everything	has	to	be	authentic,	sincere.	Otherwise	you
will	do	every	day	the	same	thing;	it	will	become	automatic.	You	will	become	a
good	 actor,	 but	 not	 a	 meditator.	 I	 want	 you	 really	 to	 be	 knocked	 conscious,
because	that	is	the	only	way	to	find	the	meaning	and	truth	of	life.
This	 evening,	 don't	 act,	 be	 real	 and	 be	 as	 total	 as	 possible.	 Throw	 out	 all	 the
gibberish	--
and	you	have	enough.	Don't	be	worried	that	you	will	miss	it,	it	will	come	back!
When	you	throw	it	out,	it	is	just	like	a	thrown	ball.	It	hits	the	wall	or	the	tree	and
comes	back	to	you.
Here,	 all	 around,	 everybody	 is	 throwing	 his	 garbage.	 Once	 in	 a	 while	 it	 gets
mixed	up,	entangled;	I	can	see	it,	that	you	are	getting	somebody	else's	garbage.
But	 garbage	 is	 garbage	 ...	 and	 that's	why	 I	warn	 you,	 don't	 sit	 silently.	Throw
everything	as	fast	as	possible,	because	you	have	to	throw	yours	and	you	have	to
avoid	others'	coming	--
because	everybody	is	throwing	towards	you.	If	you	sit	silently,	you	will	collect
such	a	good	load	of	garbage	that	 it	will	be	very	difficult	for	you	even	to	move
with	that	load	--	a	truckload!
I	go	on	seeing,	when	people	are	throwing	their	garbage	it	goes	on	slipping	from
Stonehead	 Niskriya's	 head;	 it	 falls	 over	 it,	 jumps	 away.	 But	 he	 is	 really	 a
stonehead.	He	remains	silent,	does	not	allow	anything	to	enter	into	him.
Don't	 remain	silent.	Gibberish	 is	one	of	 the	most	scientific	ways	 to	clean	your
mind.	And	if	somebody	wants	the	garbage,	he	can	take	it;	but	here	nobody	wants
it.	So	when	you	are	throwing,	be	honest,	don't	act.	When	you	are	silent,	be	really
silent.	 When	 you	 are	 looking	 in,	 then	 don't	 open	 your	 eyes	 even	 for	 a	 split
second	 just	 to	 see	what	 is	 happening	 to	 others.	 It	 is	 not	 your	 concern	what	 is
happening	to	them.	Let	them	tackle	their	problem;	you	manage	yours.
And	when	I	say	--	and	Nivedano	beats	the	drum	--	to	relax	and	let	go,	just	fall
like	a	falling	tree;	don't	try	to	make	yourself	comfortable.	That	is	the	point	where
you	miss.	I	see	people	making	themselves	comfortable.	From	the	very	beginning
they	 look	all	around	--	where	will	 they	have	 to	 relax?	Which	side	 to	 fall?	You
just	 fall	 as	 if	 you	 are	 falling	 dead.	 And	 there	 is	 no	 Osho	 -	 The	 Language	 of

Before	this	knocking	out	happens,	a	few	laughters	just	to	prepare	the	way.	Even
if	you	have	to	die,	die	laughing.	And	one	never	knows	...	everybody	has	to	die.
Someday	somebody	is	going	to	die	here,	but	here	death	will	be	a	totally	different
phenomenon.	It	will	be	a	conscious	death.	And	to	die	consciously	is	the	greatest
achievement	 in	 life	 because	 then	 you	 are	 never	 born	 again,	 you	 enter	 into	 the
eternal	sources	of	life.
That's	why	 I	 tell	 a	 few	 jokes	 for	 you	 to	 remember	 in	 your	 eternity.	Once	 in	 a

sannyasins	when	they	tell	jokes;	nobody	else	is	going	to	tell	jokes.	You	will	meet
dry-bone	sannyasins,	old-type,	old-fashioned.	This	will	be	your	distinction,	you
will	be	known	by	your	laughter.
Jablonski	 wants	 to	 have	 a	 date	 with	 Sally-May,	 so	 he	 goes	 to	 the	 pharmacy.
Behind	the	counter	is	pretty	Lucy	Go-Good.
"Ahem!"	says	Jablonski,	clearing	his	 throat.	"May	I	see	 the	manager	or	a	male
clerk?"
"I	 am	 the	manager	 now,"	 smiles	 Lucy,	 "and	we	 have	 no	male	 clerks.	 Tell	me
what	you	want."
"Well,"	says	Jablonski,	nervously.	"I	would	like	a	few	condoms."
"Okay,"	replies	Lucy.	"What	size?"
"Gosh!"	says	Jablonski.	"I	don't	know.	Do	they	come	in	sizes?"
"Come	 back	 here,"	 says	 Lucy,	 taking	 him	 behind	 a	 curtain	 at	 the	 back	 of	 the
store.	"Just	put	it	in,"	she	says,	lying	back	on	a	couch	and	lifting	her	skirt.
Jablonski	 is	 shocked,	 but	 seeing	 the	 situation,	 decides	 that	 it	 is	 okay.	 As	 he
inserts	his	machinery,	Lucy	smiles	and	says,	"Size	seven.	Take	it	out.	Now,	how
many	condoms	do	you	want?"
Dazed,	 Jablonski	 staggers	 out	 of	 the	 store,	 with	 his	 package	 in	 his	 hand,	 and
wanders	down	the	street.	He	runs	into	Paddy.
"What	do	you	have	there?"	asks	Paddy,	quietly	finishing	off	a	bottle	of	whisky.
Jablonski	tells	Paddy	what	just	happened	in	the	pharmacy,	and	Paddy's	eyes	light
up.	He	dashes	off	and	wobbles	into	the	store	where	Lucy	is	still	waiting	behind
the	counter.
"Excuse	me,"	slobbers	Paddy,	"but	do	you	have	condoms?"
"Yes,"	smiles	Lucy.	"What	size?"
"Size?"	smiles	Paddy,	trying	not	to	laugh.	"Gosh,	I	don't	know."
"Well,"	remarks	Lucy,	easily,	"come	with	me."
They	go	behind	the	curtain,	Lucy	lifts	her	skirt,	throws	herself	on	the	couch	and
says,	"Put	it	in."	Paddy	does,	and	does	and	does,	until	he	is	done.
"You	take	size	eight,"	says	Lucy	getting	up.	"How	many	would	you	like?"
"Well,"	replies	Paddy,	"actually,	I	don't	want	any.	I	just	came	in	for	a	fitting!"

"Yes,	man,"	says	Paddy.	"But	think	--	what	if	we	were	in	the	skin	of	the	cow?"

Maneesha,	all	the	religions	of	the	world	are	concerned	with	something	objective,
a	God	who	 is	 somewhere	 above	 the	 clouds,	 a	 heaven,	 a	 hell.	But	 they	 are	 all
outside	of	you,	they	are	all	objective.	Zen's	basic	difference	from	all	religions	is,
its	 inquiry	 is	 absolutely	 subjective.	 It	does	not	bother	 about	whether	 there	 is	 a
God	or	not,	whether	there	is	a	heaven	and	a	hell	or	not.	These	are	all	fictitious
questions,	and	all	the	answers	given	for	or	against	are	going	to	be	fictitious.
To	 the	 Zen	 seeker,	 the	 only	 reality	 is	 inwards.	 He	 does	 not	 deny	 the	 outside
reality,	but	he	does	not	concern	himself	with	it.	That	 is	 the	work	of	science,	 to
inquire	 into	 the	objective	reality.	The	authentic	 religions	should	be	confined	 to
the	inquiry	into	the	subjectivity	of	your	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
91
Chapter	8	-	Please,	settle	for	no-self
consciousness:	 from	where	arises	your	 life,	your	 love,	your	dance;	 from	where
this	whole	existence	arises,	and	to	where	you	disappear.
Now	we	 know	 even	 existence	 does	 not	 allow	 anything	 to	 be	 stable;	 even	 the
greatest	stars,	which	may	have	lived	millions	of	years	or	 trillions	of	years,	one
day	have	to	die.	Every	day	great	stars	die,	and	every	day	new	stars	are	born	--
but	 from	where?	What	 is	 the	 source	 of	 all	 life?	Whether	 it	 exists	 in	 the	 poor
grass	 leaves	or	 in	 the	richest	and	greatest	star,	 it	does	not	matter,	 the	source	of
life	is	the	same.
And	the	only	right	inquiry	is	to	go	withinwards,	to	find	your	roots,	to	find	your
center,	 to	 go	 deep	 into	 your	 center	 as	 much	 as	 possible.	 Finally	 you	 will	 be
surprised	to	know	that	as	you	go	deeper	you	start	disappearing.	A	moment	comes
when	you	disappear	and	the	whole	universe	opens	all	its	mysteries.
The	individual	is	a	fiction	--	the	whole	cosmos	is	a	reality.	We	are	just	dewdrops
on	 lotus	 leaves,	 very	 beautiful	 in	 the	 early	 morning	 sun.	 But	 a	 small	 breeze
comes	and	the	dewdrop	slips	into	the	ocean.	It	does	not	die,	it	simply	becomes
infinite,	 eternal.	 As	 a	 dewdrop	 it	 was	 going	 to	 die	 sooner	 or	 later.	 As	 an
individual	we	are	all	going	to	disappear	into	the	universe.
Before	we	disappear,	the	only	way	to	live	a	life	of	joy	and	blissfulness,	a	life	of
gratitude	and	prayer,	 is	to	find	your	eternal	roots.	And	they	are	so	close	within
your	grasp,	you	don't	have	to	go	anywhere,	neither	in	time	nor	in	space.
This	very	moment	you	are	breathing	the	universe,	your	heartbeat	is	in	tune	with
the	universe;	this	very	moment	your	roots	are	being	nourished	by	the	universe,
just	you	have	never	looked	within.	And	you	have	been	unnecessarily	begging	for
small	things,	while	inside	you	are	an	emperor.	The	splendor	that	you	have	inside
you	is	unimaginable,	the	treasure	is	incalculable.	Just	a	single	look	inside	and	a
new	dimension	of	existence	opens	up.	And	this	is	your	reality,	authentic	reality.
It	is	so	blissful	and	ecstatic	that	once	you	have	tasted	it	you	will	carry	this	taste
around	the	clock.
In	 terms	 of	 Zen	 this	 is	 called	 the	 experience	 of	 the	 buddha.	 Everybody	 is	 a
buddha.	A	few	buddhas	are	looking	outward;	hence	they	are	not	aware	of	their
inner	treasure	and	majesty.
And	a	few	buddhas	have	looked	inward	and	are	amazed:	what	you	are	seeking
outside	is	trivial,	the	real	treasure	is	inside.	And	you	were	born	with	it	--	it	is	not
something	to	be	achieved,	it	is	something	to	be	recognized,	to	be	remembered.	It
is	a	forgotten	language.
Zen	 can	 be	 reduced	 into	 a	 simple	 definition:	 it	 teaches	 you	 the	 forgotten
language.	 It	 teaches	you	the	 language	of	 the	 inner	world.	Simple	are	 the	steps;
there	is	no	complication.
You	don't	need	to	have	a	great	intelligence,	all	that	you	need	is	a	little	courage	...
a	little	courage	to	forget	all	the	desires	that	lead	you	outwards;	a	little	courage	to
look	inwards,	which	is	an	unknown	territory,	untraveled.	In	the	beginning	it	will
look	very	dark	and	you	will	be	very	alone.
Most	people	 in	 life	have	tried	to	 look	inwards,	 then	immediately	came	back	to
the	outside	world.	They	have	become	too	much	accustomed	to	being	a	sheep	in	a
crowd.	They	don't	have	the	guts	to	be	a	lion,	and	to	be	alone.	They	don't	know
the	beauty	of	aloneness;	they	don't	even	know	the	distinction	between	loneliness
and	aloneness.
Loneliness	 is	 always	 begging	 for	 somebody,	 loneliness	 is	 missing	 somebody.
Loneliness	is	a	miserable	state.	But	aloneness	is	finding	yourself	in	such	glory,	in
such	beauty	and	benediction,	that	no	desire	remains.	Even	clouds	are	below	your
feet,	 even	 faraway	 stars	 suddenly	 come	 close	 to	 you,	 because	 you	 are	 getting
more	and	more	intimate	with	the	existence.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
92
Chapter	8	-	Please,	settle	for	no-self
The	only	richness	is	to	know	oneself.
By	knowing	oneself	one	comes	to	know	that	he	was	only	a	door	to	the	vast	and
the	infinite,	to	the	eternal	and	the	deathless.	It	is	a	very	strange	paradox	that	the
moment	 you	 know	 yourself,	 you	 are	 not,	 the	 whole	 is.	 The	 dewdrop	 has
disappeared,	and	all	around	is	the	ocean.
One	of	the	Indian	mystics,	Kabir,	in	his	youth	wrote	a	small	poem,	the	beginning
of	which	means,	"I	have	been	searching	my	self,	my	friend.	But	on	the	contrary,
finding	myself,	I	found	no	'myself.'	The	dewdrop	disappeared	in	the	ocean,	now
where	to	find	it?	I	am	no	more."
At	the	time	of	his	death	he	called	his	son,	Kamal,	and	said	to	him,	"Correct	those
lines.	 As	 I	 have	 become	more	 intimate	 with	 reality	 I	 see	 that	 a	 correction	 is
urgently	needed,	and	I	am	going	to	die.	After	me	nobody	will	have	the	courage
to	correct	me."	And	in	fact	those	lines	are	so	beautiful,	there	is	no	need	to	correct
them.
Kamal	said,	 "Those	 lines	are	 so	beautiful	 --	 the	dewdrop	disappearing	 into	 the
ocean	--
what	more	do	you	want?"
Kabir	said,	"Change	it,	make	it	the	other	way	around	--	the	ocean	disappearing
into	the	dewdrop.	My	first	experience	was	that	the	dewdrop	is	disappearing;	my
last	experience	is	that	the	ocean	has	disappeared	into	me.	Now	I	am	the	whole."
What	people	 like	al-Hillaj	Mansoor	say	 --	 "ANA'L-HAQ!"	 I	am	 the	 truth	 --	 is
not	bragging,	 they	are	 simply	 stating	an	ordinary	 fact	of	 everybody's	 life.	You
either	 know	 or	 you	 don't	 know	 --	 it	 is	 up	 to	 you.	 You	 can	 delay	 as	 long	 as
possible;	you	have	 the	whole	eternity	 to	postpone.	But	by	postponing	 the	 truth
you	are	living	in	utter	misery,	suffering,	anguish,	anxiety.	Your	whole	life	is	just
a	tragedy	--	tragedy	upon	tragedy,	failure	upon	failure.
Everybody	is	trying	to	hide	his	tears	and	failures.	Your	love	is	unfulfilled,	your
desire	is	incomplete,	whatever	you	have	longed	for	has	disappeared	as	a	mirage
...
You	know	the	ordinary	proverb	of	the	ancients:	man	proposes	and	God	disposes.
There	 is	 no	 God,	 and	 what	 purpose	 will	 be	 served	 by	 God	 disposing	 your
desires?	 He	 will	 be	 getting	 mad	 by	 disposing	 everybody's	 propositions.
Everybody	is	proposing	a	thousand	and	one	things,	and	God	goes	on	disposing!
He	seems	to	be	a	head	clerk	or	something,	who	simply	disposes	of	files	without
even	looking	in	them.
But	 the	 proverb	 carries	 meaning.	 God	 may	 not	 exist,	 but	 in	 the	 very	 fact	 of
proposing	you	have	disposed	yourself.	 In	 the	very	 fact	 of	 proposing	you	have
asked	 existence	 to	 be	 according	 to	 you,	 and	 this	 vast	 existence	 cannot	 be
according	 to	 you.	 If	 you	want	 it	 to	 be	 according	 to	 you,	 you	will	 have	 to	 be
according	to	it.
Don't	try	to	swim	upstream,	just	let	the	river	take	you	to	the	ocean.	Why	make
unnecessary	effort	and	get	tired?	That	is	one	of	the	essentials	of	Zen:	no	effort,
total	 relaxation	 into	 the	 hands	 of	 totality;	 no	 seeking,	 but	 just	 looking	 in.
Because	it	is	already	there,	you	don't	have	to	seek.
Zen	will	not	agree	with	Jesus	--	neither	do	I	agree.	The	words	are	very	beautiful;
one	is	tempted	to	agree	with	Jesus	when	he	says,	"Seek	and	ye	shall	find"	--	it	is
poetry	 --	"Knock	and	 the	doors	shall	be	opened	unto	you.	Ask	and	 the	answer
will	be	given	to	you."
It	hurts	to	object,	but	one	is	helpless.	Jesus	has	to	be	criticized	on	those	points,
because	 Zen	 says,	 if	 you	 seek	 you	 will	 go	 far	 away.	 Don't	 seek,	 just	 be.	 In
seeking	 you	 have	 to	 go	 somewhere,	 you	 have	 to	 do	 something,	 you	 have	 to
follow	some	guide.	Don't	seek,	just	be;	or	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
93
Chapter	8	-	Please,	settle	for	no-self
don't	seek	and	find.	On	whose	doors	are	you	going	to	knock?	It	is	beautiful	when
you	read	Jesus,	"Knock	and	the	doors	shall	be	opened	unto	you."	We	can	forgive
him	for	his	poetry,	but	on	whose	doors	are	you	going	to	knock?
There	are	no	doors	to	existence.	Don't	waste	your	time	knocking	on	doors.	Just
close	your	eyes	and	 the	whole	sky	of	 the	 inner	 is	open;	 there	are	no	doors,	no
windows,	no	locks,	no	keys.	And	Jesus	says	the	answer	will	be	given	to	you	if
you	 question.	 Zen	 says	 you	 are	 the	 answer,	 just	 drop	 the	 question.	 It	 is	 the
question	that	is	hindering	your	finding	the	answer.
Don't	question,	just	enter	inside	yourself	with	grandeur,	an	essence	of	birthright.
Without	any	question,	you	are	the	answer.	Your	consciousness,	your	awareness,
your	being,	reveals	all	the	truths	and	all	the	mysteries	of	existence.
Bukko	is	an	important	master.	He	says:
IT	 MAY	 BE	 ASKED,	 HOW	 IS	 THE	 SELF	 TO	 BE	 APPROACHED?	 BY
LOOKING
INTO	 IT	 THROUGH	 THIS	 SORT	 OF	 INQUIRY:	 FORTY	 YEARS	 AGO,
WHERE	DID	IT
COME	 FROM;	 AND	 A	 HUNDRED	 YEARS	 HENCE,	 WHERE	 WILL	 IT
HAVE	GONE
TO?	AND	RIGHT	NOW,	WHO	 IS	 THE	 PERSON	WHO	 IS	MAKING	 THE
INQUIRY?
That	is	the	most	significant	point.	You	are	asking	a	question,	but	are	you	aware
who	the	person	is	behind	the	question,	who	is	asking	the	question?	The	question
cannot	 arise	 from	 nowhere,	 there	must	 be	 someone	 hidden	 inside	 you	who	 is
asking	 the	question.	Drop	 the	question	and	 find	 the	questioner.	And	 in	 finding
the	 questioner,	 you	 will	 find	 the	 answer.	 It	 is	 a	 very	 strange	 and	 paradoxical
world.	Howsoever	difficult	it	may	seem	in	the	beginning,	if	you	just	take	a	single
step	inwards,	everything	goes	on	becoming	more	and	more	simple.
Gertrude	Stein,	one	of	the	most	significant	women	poets,	was	on	her	deathbed.
Her	 friends	 had	 gathered,	 knowing	 that	 her	 death	 was	 close.	 Suddenly,	 she
opened	her	eyes	and	asked,
"What	is	 the	answer?"	Everybody	looked	at	each	other,	 thinking,	"It	seems	she
has	gone	senile
...	We	don't	know	the	question,	how	can	we	say	what	the	answer	is?"	Somebody
gathered	 courage	 and	 asked,	 "You	 are	 being	 very	 illogical.	You	 are	 asking	 us,
'What	is	the	answer?'	but	we	don't	know	the	question."
Gertrude	Stein	laughed	and	said,	"Okay,	then	tell	me	what	the	question	is!"	And
she	died	with	a	smile.
To	me,	 in	 the	West	 very	 few	 people	 have	 attained	 to	 the	 state	Gertrude	 Stein
attained.	In	her	last	moment	she	certainly	became	a	buddha.	She	is	saying,	there
is	no	question	and	there	is	no	answer.	Life	is	so	simple,	so	beautiful,	so	honest.
There	is	no	place	for	any	question	or	for	any	answer.	Life	can	be	sung,	life	can
be	danced,	life	can	be	loved;	but	there	is	no	question	and	there	is	no	answer.
Bukko	is	saying:
WHO	 IS	 THE	 PERSON	WHO	 IS	MAKING	 THE	 INQUIRY?	 THAT	 TRUE
FACE
WHICH	WAS	BEFORE	FATHER	AND	MOTHER	WERE	BORN,	WHERE	IS
IT	RIGHT
NOW?
You	must	have	had	a	face	before	you	were	born.	Or	were	you	faceless?	And	you
will	have	a	face	when	you	are	dead.	Or	do	you	think	you	won't	have	any	face?
Zen's	most	significant	inquiry	is	to	find	the	original	face.	This	face	that	you	have
right	now	is	not	your	original	face,	it	is	changing	every	moment.	Every	moment
you	are	becoming	older;	every	moment	death	is	coming	closer.	Just	a	few	years
before	you	were	a	child,	and	just	a	few	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
94
Chapter	8	-	Please,	settle	for	no-self
years	afterwards	you	were	an	old	man.	A	few	more	years	and	not	even	a	trace	of
you	will	 be	 found	 anywhere.	How	many	millions	 of	 people	 have	 lived	 before
you?
Some	crackpot	has	inquired	--	because	only	crackpots	inquire	into	such	things	--
and	found	that	wherever	you	are	sitting,	there	have	been	at	least	eight	graves	in
the	past.	You	are	sitting	on	eight	ghosts!	And	just	think	of	the	implication	--	you
will	be	the	ninth.	And	the	tenth	ghost	will	be	sitting	on	your	head.	Where	have
all	those	people	disappeared?
No.	This	face,	this	body,	this	mind	which	comes	and	goes,	is	not	your	true	being,
your	original	face.	You	have	to	find	something	in	you	which	never	changes.	In
Zen	language,	that	which	never	changes	in	you	is	your	original	face.	All	others
are	masks.
Only	 one	 thing	 never	 changes	 in	 you	 and	 that	 is	 witnessing,	 watchfulness,
awareness.
Everything	changes.	You	are	aware	of	 the	anger,	anger	will	change.	How	long
can	you	be	angry?	The	hottest	person	is	going	to	be	cool	sooner	or	later,	and	the
coolest	 person	 can	 be	 driven	 to	 be	 hot.	You	 love,	 but	 the	moment	 you	 say,	 "I
love,"	 you	 should	 remember	 that	 love	 has	 started	 dying.	 Soon	 you	 will	 be
carrying	 the	corpse	of	 love,	 still	 saying	 the	old	words,	 repeated	dialogues.	But
deep	inside	you	know	the	love	that	was	a	romance,	a	poetry,	a	song,	is	no	more
there;	your	heart	no	more	sings,	no	more	dances.
But	awareness	remains	the	same.	At	one	time	it	was	aware	that	you	loved,	now	it
is	aware	that	love	is	gone.	Seasons	come	and	go,	flowers	blossom	and	disappear
in	 the	 dust,	 but	 at	 the	 deepest	 core	 of	 your	 being	 is	 the	 greatest	 mystery	 of
awareness,	which	is	eternal,	which	is	your	original	face.
WHEN	SUDDENLY	ONE	DAY	THE	LIGHT	OF	LIFE,	NOW	SO	BRILLIANT,
WILL
BE	WITHDRAWN,	WHERE	DOES	IT	GO	TO?
IN	THIS	SORT	OF	WAY,	CONTINUED	BUKKO,	LOOK	 INTO	THE	SELF.
LOOK
WHEN	YOU	SLEEP,	LOOK	WHEN	YOU	SIT,	LOOK	WHEN	YOU	WALK.
And	you	will	be	surprised	that	 the	awareness	remains	 the	same.	When	you	are
sitting,	 it	 does	 not	 mean	 that	 the	 awareness	 is	 sitting	 also.	 When	 you	 are
walking,	 it	 does	 not	 mean	 that	 the	 awareness	 is	 walking	 also.	When	 you	 are
going	to	your	bed,	 it	does	not	mean	the	awareness	 is	also	going	to	sleep.	Who
watches	 the	 dreams?	 Asleep	 or	 awake,	 sitting	 or	 standing,	 walking	 or	 not
walking	--	one	thing	in	you	is	absolutely	the	same.	And	to	find	this	is	the	whole
of	religion;	everything	else	is	non-essential.
WHEN	YOU	FIND	YOU	CANNOT	LOOK	ANYMORE,	THEN	YOU	MUST
LOOK
AND	 SEE	 HOW	 THAT	 INABILITY	 TO	 LOOK	 APPEARS	 AND
DISAPPEARS.
It	is	the	experience	of	all	meditators	that	sometimes	you	are	aware,	and	then	you
forget	 and	 you	 are	 not	 aware,	 and	 then	 again	 you	 remember.	 But	 behind	 this
awareness,	 forgetfulness,	awareness,	 forgetfulness,	 there	 is	a	deeper	awareness,
which	always	remains.	What	changes	 is	your	mental	 recognition	of	awareness.
Sometimes	it	is	there,	sometimes	it	is	not	there.
Mind	cannot	continue	remembering	a	thing	forever.	It	 is	a	flux.	Every	moment
new	thoughts	are	coming,	every	moment	new	desires	are	arising,	every	moment
new	 longings	are	knocking	on	your	doors.	There	 is	 so	much	busyness	without
business	 in	 the	mind	 that	 remembering	you	are	a	buddha	 is	only	a	momentary
thing.	Soon	you	will	forget	and	you	will	start	behaving	in	the	ordinary	way.	And
suddenly,	at	some	moment	you	will	again	remember,	what	are	you	doing?	You
are	a	buddha	and	you	are	smoking	a	cigarette?	It	does	not	look	good
--	a	buddha	and	smoking	cigarettes?	You	may	drop	the	cigarette	--	nobody	can
drop	buddhahood	for	a	cigarette.

Chapter	8	-	Please,	settle	for	no-self
But	these	are	mind	recognitions	which	change;	otherwise,	underneath	there	is	an
awareness	which	knows	when	you	remember	and	when	you	forget.	That	is	your
original	face.
AS	YOU	ARE	LOOKING	AT	HOW	THE	SIGHT	COMES	AND	THE	SIGHT
GOES,	SATORI	REALIZATION	WILL	ARISE	OF	ITSELF.
Satori	is	the	Japanese	name	for	SAMADHI.	Samadhi	is	the	ultimate	experience;
its	very	meaning	is,	everything	is	solved.	Samadhi	means	everything	is	solved	--
no	question,	no	answer.	One	is	at	peace	with	existence,	one	has	come	home	...	a
tremendous	relaxation	which	is	never	disturbed	again.	Just	following	awareness,
going	deeper	and	deeper	from	the	mental	to	the	non-mental	awareness,	you	end
up	in	realization	of	satori,	or	samadhi.
ON	ANOTHER	OCCASION,	BUKKO	SAID:	THE	DHARMA	IS	DIFFERENT
FROM
SEEING,	HEARING,	PERCEIVING,	KNOWING.
But	he	does	not	include	awareness.
SEEING,	HEARING,	PERCEIVING,	KNOWING	ARE	ALL	DHARMA.
But	 none	 of	 them	 is	 comprehensive	 enough	 to	 make	 dharma-nature	 its
monopoly.
But	he	has	not	mentioned	awareness.	Perhaps	he	is	talking	to	people	who	are	not
yet	meditators;	otherwise	awareness	is	dharma.	Awareness	includes	everything,
and	something	more	that	cannot	be	said.
THIS	 MOUNTAIN	 PRIEST,	 says	 Bukko,	 MAKES	 A	 HOME	 FOR	 THE
PEOPLE	OF
THE	WIDE	EARTH.	WITHOUT	THE	DUST	BEING	RAISED	THEY	ENTER
THE
REALM	OF	PARADISE.
There	 is	 no	 need	 to	make	much	 fuss	 about	 your	 religion.	 It	 has	 to	 be	 utterly
silent;	even	your	neighbor	should	not	know	what	you	are	doing	inside	yourself.
But	 the	 people	 of	 the	 earth	 have	 been	 behaving	 differently.	 Everybody	 is
proclaiming	who	he	is	--	a	Hindu,	a	Mohammedan,	a	Christian,	a	Jew,	a	Jaina,	a
Buddhist.	A	dharma	should	be	such	a	secret	phenomenon,	so	 intimate	 that	you
would	not	like	to	talk	about	it.
I	have	not,	in	my	whole	life,	voted	in	any	election,	for	the	simple	reason	that	the
form	 that	 has	 to	 be	 filled	 in	 to	 become	 a	 voter	 has	 a	 question	 in	 it:	 to	 what
religion	do	you	belong?	That	I	cannot	say.	That	is	my	secret,	that	is	my	privacy.
No	government	is	allowed	to	enter	into	my	privacy.
And	when	I	refused,	saying,	"I	will	not	fill	in	this	question,"	the	poor	man	who
was	collecting	the	forms	said,	"But	you	are	a	strange	fellow	--	everybody	fills	it
in.	If	you	don't	have	any	religion	you	can	say	you	are	an	atheist."
I	said,	"I	am	not	an	atheist,	but	 I	am	not	a	 theist	either.	 I	am	just	myself.	And
finding	myself,	I	have	found	the	beauty	of	being	natural.	It	need	not	be	given	an
adjective	--	Hindu,	Mohammedan,	Christian.	To	give	an	adjective	to	nature	is	to
defile	a	great	experience."
But	 everybody	 is	making	 so	much	 fuss	 about	 religion.	 Religion	 should	 be	 an
absolutely	 silent	 phenomenon.	 In	 the	 deepest	 night,	 sitting	 on	 your	 bed,	 you
should	enter	into	yourself.
Your	own	wife,	or	your	husband,	or	your	children	will	not	know	about	 it.	 It	 is
not	 something	which	 can	 be	 done	 as	 a	 crowd,	 or	 as	 a	 family.	 It	 is	 something
which	is	absolutely	individual.
Your	awareness	is	only	your	awareness.

Yes,	 at	 the	 ultimate	 peak,	 when	 you	 will	 be	 disappearing	 into	 the	 universal
energies,	 your	 individuality	 will	 also	 be	 lost.	 Then	 nothing	 is	 private,	 then
everything	is	universal;	but	there	is	nobody	to	declare	it.
I	have	just	mentioned	al-Hillaj	Mansoor,	a	Sufi	mystic	who	was	killed	just	like
Jesus	Christ	--	of	course	in	a	more	primitive	and	ugly	way.	He	was	cut	part	by
part	 --	 legs,	 hands,	 head	 ...	 And	 his	 only	 crime	 was	 that	 he	 had	 declared
"ANA'L-HAQ"	 --	 I	 am	 the	 truth.	His	 own	master,	 Junnaid,	 used	 to	 calm	 him
down:	"Yes,	we	all	know	you	are	the	truth,	but	there	is	no	need	to	say	it."
I	 have	 been	 deeply	 inquiring	 into	 Junnaid,	 because	 al-Hillaj	 Mansoor	 has
become	world	famous.	Junnaid	also	knew,	"I	am	God,	I	am	truth,"	but	he	was	a
more	understanding,	more	sane	person.
He	 used	 to	 tell	 Mansoor,	 "If	 you	 know	 it,	 you	 need	 not	 say	 it.	 Your	 saying
simply	means	that	you	want	a	confirmation.	But	who	can	confirm	it?	Only	you
know."	There	is	something	in	the	inner	experience	that	nobody	can	confirm	and
nobody	can	certify.	No	government	can	give	a	certificate	 to	you	 that,	yes,	you
are	enlightened.	No	committee	can	confirm	it,	no	university	can	offer	a	degree	in
enlightenment	--	it	is	absolutely	private.
I	 agree	 very	 much	 with	 Junnaid;	 he	 understands	 the	 psychology	 of
enlightenment	 far	 more	 deeply	 than	 al-Hillaj	 Mansoor.	 He	 is	 saying,	 "Your
statement	 means	 you	 want	 others	 to	 recognize	 you,	 but	 this	 very	 desire	 for
recognition	is	poor.	This	desire	for	recognition	simply	means	you	are	not	certain,
there	is	still	some	doubt	lurking	inside	you	about	whether	you	are	enlightened	or
not."
But	Mansoor	 did	 not	 listen	 to	 him	 --	 he	was	 too	 young.	He	was	 right,	 but	 to
declare	 that	 you	 are	 the	 truth	 in	 a	 crowd	means	 that	 you	 are	 going	 to	 offend
people.	And	he	did	not	complete	the	sentence.	If	he	had	said,	"Just	as	I	am	the
truth,	you	are	also	the	truth,"	things	would	have	been	different.
Jesus	was	crucified	for	his	proclamation	that	he	is	the	son	of	God;	Mansoor	was
crucified	 for	his	declaration	 that	he	 is	 the	ultimate	 truth.	 In	 India	 thousands	of
buddhas	have	expressed	this,	but	they	have	always	expressed	it	in	a	way	which
includes	you,	which	does	not	exclude	you	from	their	experience.	They	say	that
they	 are	 the	 buddha,	 but	 they	 also	 say	 that	 you	 are	 also	 the	 buddha,	 and	 the
difference	 between	 them	 and	 you	 is	 very	 slight,	 not	 even	 worth	 calling	 a
difference.	They	have	opened	their	eyes	to	their	own	reality;	you	are	still	a	little
sleepy	--	maybe	last	night's	hangover	...	Just	a	little	more	--	another	turn	in	the
bed,	pulling	the	blanket	over	your	face.	But	how	long	are	you	going	to	do	this?	I
don't	think	you	will	be	able	to	do	it	for	eternity.	One	day	you	are	going	to	jump
out	of	the	bed:	"Enough	is	enough,	Ana'l-haq!"
LIFTING	HIGH	HIS	STAFF,	BUKKO	SAID:	OM,	OM,	OM!
Om	is	the	silent	sound,	when	the	mind	stops	all	chattering	and	you	enter	into	the
world	of	no-mind.	The	music	of	no-mind	 is	 something	 closer	 to	Om.	 It	 is	 not
exactly	Om,	but	Om	comes	very	close	to	that	subtle	sound.
BUKKO	SAID:	HASTE,	HASTE,	HASTE!
All	the	buddhas	are	saying	that.	Why	are	you	postponing	your	own	blissfulness,
your	own	divinity?	Why	are	you	postponing?
QUICK,	QUICK,	QUICK!
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
97
Chapter	8	-	Please,	settle	for	no-self
This	 is	 not	 only	Bukko.	All	 the	 buddhas	 down	 the	 ages	 have	 been	 concerned
about	your	continuous	snoring.	They	make	every	effort,	 they	 throw	cold	water
into	 your	 eyes,	 but	 rather	 than	 getting	 up,	 you	 simply	 freak	 out.	You	 become
angry	rather	than	becoming	a	buddha.
They	have	been	pulling	your	legs,	they	have	been	pulling	your	blankets,	and	you
become	angry:	"In	the	early	morning	it	is	too	cold,	and	this	old	guy	has	nothing
else	to	do	--	he	is	pulling	my	blanket."
You	become	angry,	you	shout,	but	you	don't	understand	 that	 all	 these	buddhas
are	calling	for	you	to	be	quick	out	of	compassion.
Bukko	says:	BOW,	BOW,	BOW!
Existence	is	calling	for	your	gratitude,	for	your	prayer,	for	your	gratefulness.	But
how	can	you	be	grateful	if	you	have	not	experienced	it?	You	have	been	sleeping
for	centuries,	 for	hundreds	of	 lives.	You	cannot	be	grateful	 to	existence.	 It	has
given	 you	 only	 misery	 up	 to	 now,	 only	 suffering.	 It	 was	 not	 existence's
responsibility,	you	were	creating	it	yourself.
You	 are	 a	 great	 genius	 in	 creating	 misery!	 If	 someday	 you	 find	 yourself
untroubled,	unworried,	unconcerned,	you	will	 jump	on	your	 rented	cycle	 to	go
somewhere,	to	do	something.	This	is	not	natural,	sitting	silently;	it	looks	a	little
weird.	Just	sit	silently	like	a	buddha	and	the	neighbors	will	start	looking	at	you	--
"Something	 has	 gone	wrong;	what	 has	 happened	 to	 this	 poor	 fellow?	He	was
running	here	and	there	on	his	rented	bicycle,	and	now	he	does	not	even	care	who
is	taking	his	bicycle!	He	is	sitting	with	closed	eyes,	undisturbed.
Something	must	have	gone	wrong."
And	 you	will	 also	 think,	 "Something	 seems	 to	 be	wrong.	 Somebody	 is	 taking
notes	from	my	pocket	and	I	am	saying	nothing.	Have	I	gone	mad?"
All	your	miseries	are	your	own	creations;	you	cannot	live	without	them.	You	hug
them,	you	sleep	with	them.	They	are	very	familiar,	friendly,	well	known	to	you.
And	you	brag	about	them:	how	many	migraines	you	have.	As	if	it	is	something
great	 that	 you	 have	 a	migraine,	 that	 your	 stomach	 ...	 People	 are	 talking	 about
amoebas,	stomachs,	headaches,	migraines,	and	they	call	it	great	conversation!	It
seems	the	whole	world	is	a	big	hospital.
THROWING	 HIGH,	 NOT	 REACHING	 THE	 SKY;	 LAYING	 DOWN,	 NOT
REACHING
THE	EARTH.	ALL	THE	BUDDHAS	AND	PATRIARCHS	 FIND	NO	HOLD
AT	ALL.
HOLD,	NO	HOLD.	OM!
He	is	saying,	there	is	nothing	to	hold,	but	don't	be	worried	--	existence	will	take
care	of	you.	It	has	always	taken	care.
If	it	was	left	for	you	to	remember	to	breathe,	do	you	think	you	would	have	been
alive?	 If	 it	was	 left	up	 to	you	 to	 remember	 to	keep	your	heart	beating,	do	you
think	you	would	be	here	today?	Long	ago	you	would	have	been	in	your	grave,	or
on	a	funeral	pyre.	You	would	have	forgotten	very	easily.
If	somebody	insults	you,	at	that	time	do	you	think	you	will	remember	to	breathe?
If	somebody	 is	 taking	away	your	 rented	bicycle,	do	you	 think	at	 that	 time	you
will	remember	that	the	heart	should	continue	to	beat?	There	are	a	thousand	and
one	opportunities	in	a	day	to	forget.
Existence	 has	 not	 left	 essential	 functions	 up	 to	 you,	 it	 has	 kept	 essential
functions	in	its	own	care.	So	you	can	sleep	and	breathing	will	continue,	you	can
be	angry	and	breathing	will	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence

Chapter	8	-	Please,	settle	for	no-self
continue,	you	can	fight	and	still	your	heart	will	not	stop.	You	can	do	everything;
the	essential	things	of	life	are	not	dependent	on	you.	They	are	connected,	rooted
in	the	universe.
The	universe	is	already	taking	care	of	you,	but	you	have	not	been	grateful.	The
only	 prayer	 I	 know	of	 is	 the	 prayer	 of	 gratitude	 --	 "I	 am	nobody	 and	 still	 the
whole	existence	takes	care	of	me."
ALL	THE	BUDDHAS	AND	PATRIARCHS	FIND	NO	HOLD	AT	ALL.	HOLD,
NO
HOLD.	OM!	--	DIVINE	STREAMS	RUSHING,	RUSHING!
You	don't	be	worried.	HOLD,	NO	HOLD,	whether	you	have	any	possessions	or
no	 possessions,	 whether	 you	 are	 or	 you	 are	 not,	 the	 divine	 stream	 is	 rushing
continuously.	You	are	part	of	 it,	or	you	are	 the	whole	of	 it	 --	 it	all	depends	on
you:	to	remain	a	part	or	to	become	the	whole.
I	mentioned	Kabir.	First	he	was	just	a	dewdrop	disappearing	into	the	ocean,	but
at	the	last	moment	of	his	life	he	recognized,	from	the	other	side,	that	the	ocean
had	disappeared	into	the	dewdrop.	The	truth	became	complete.

There	are	people	who	are	searching	in	the	mountains,	in	the	cities,	in	the	forest,

searching;	he	was	tired	and	fed	up.	That	very	night	he	became	enlightened.

Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
LATELY	 I	 HAVE	 FELT	 AWARE	 THAT	 WE	 ARE	 JUST	 BIG	 VACUUMS,
EMPTINESSES,	 WALKING	 AROUND	 WITH	 A	 FACADE	 OF
PERSONALITY	THAT
DOES	 THINGS	 AND	 THINKS	 THOUGHTS.	 BUT	 BUKKO	 TALKS	 OF
"APPROACHING
THE	 SELF."	 IS	 THE	 SELF	ANYTHING	OTHER	 THAN	 THAT	 SENSE	OF
EMPTINESS?
ARE	 THE	 QUESTIONS	 JUST	 A	 MEANS	 TO	 DISCOVER	 THERE	 IS	 NO
SELF?
Yes,	Maneesha.	All	 inquiry	 in	 the	beginning	 is	 to	 find	 the	 self.	But	when	you
find	it,	it	is	not	the	self.	When	you	find	it,	it	is	no-self.	But	to	tell	somebody,	"Go
on	a	search	for	no-self,"
he	will	say,	"Are	you	mad?	I	am	already	puzzled	and	in	trouble,	and	I	should	go
in	 search	 for	 no-self,	 no-mind,	 emptiness,	 nothingness?	 I	 am	 already	 troubled
and	 you	 are	 encouraging	 me	 to	 go	 into	 more	 troubled	 waters.	 Why	 should	 I
search	for	no-self?"
Hence	the	buddhas	say	to	you,	"Go	to	search	the	self."	Because	they	know	you
will	 find	no-self,	 so	 there	 is	no	problem.	They	 say,	 "Go	and	 search	 inside	and
you	will	find	everything."
But	you	will	find	only	a	pure	nothingness.
But	that	cannot	be	said.	That	can	be	said	only	to	the	adepts,	to	those	who	are	on
the	path	and	are	able	to	listen	and	understand	that	the	ultimate	search	can	only	be
a	 dissolution	 into	 the	 whole	 cosmos,	 just	 like	 a	 wave	 disappearing	 into	 the
ocean,	or	a	stream	running	fast	--
according	to	Bukko	--	with	haste,	reaching	to	the	ocean	just	to	disappear.
People's	minds	are	oriented	 to	achieve	 something.	 If	you	say	 to	 them,	 "Search
for	God,"	 it	 is	understandable,	because	finding	God	will	be	a	great	 joy,	and	he
will	give	you	all	that	you	had	always	desired.	He	will	give	you	a	right	place	to
live	in	heaven,	a	beautiful	palace,	where	rivers	are	full	of	wine,	and	where	young
women	who	never	grow	old	 ...	 at	 least	up	 to	now	 it	has	never	been	heard	 that
they	ever	grow	old	--	they	have	been	at	the	age	of	sixteen,	fixed,	for	centuries.
My	own	understanding	is	that	they	are	not	real	women	but	plastic,	pumped	with
air.	They	don't	perspire	--	that	is	significant	to	understand.	The	scriptures	make	it
clear	 that	 they	 don't	 perspire.	 Only	 plastic	 does	 not	 perspire,	 and	 only	 plastic
never	grows	old.	And	it	is	very	good	and	transportable.	Just	take	the	air	out,	fold
up	the	woman,	put	her	in	your	suitcase,	and	wherever	you	are	going,	go.	You	can
even	have	two	or	three	women	in	one	suitcase.
I	have	heard	...	Two	scientists	were	going	to	explore	in	Siberia.	They	were	in	the
last	village	post,	and	they	were	collecting	everything	that	they	would	need	in	the
cold,	in	the	eternal	snows.	And	they	were	going	to	live	there	for	almost	a	year,	so
they	were	collecting	all	the	things	that	they	would	need	.
The	 shop	 owner	 said,	 "Listen,	 I	 have	 been	 here	 selling	 things	 to	 scientists,
explorers,	 and	 I	 always	 suggest	 to	 them	 ...	 first	 they	 feel	 shocked,	 but	 then
finally	they	agree	with	me."	Those	two	scientists	said,	"What	do	you	mean?"
He	said,	"You	take	a	plastic	woman	with	you	--	I	have	very	beautiful	models."
They	 said,	 "What	 nonsense!	 Plastic	 women?	 What	 will	 we	 do	 with	 plastic
women?"

The	old	shopkeeper	said,	"You	will	miss	...	don't	take	the	chance,	be	on	the	safer
side.	And	it	will	not	take	much	space	in	your	suitcase."	And	he	brought	a	folded
woman,	pumped	air	 into	 it	 --	and	 it	was	 really	a	good	model,	a	Sophia	Loren.
They	both	thought,	"It	looks	a	little	weird,	but	what	is	the	harm?"	But	one	said,
"No,	I	don't	want	to	be	so	stupid.	Carrying	a	plastic	woman	...	and	I	am	a	great
Nobel	Prize	winner!"
The	 other	 said,	 "You	 remain	 a	 Nobel	 Prize	 winner,	 but	 remember,	 it	 is	 my
woman.	I	am	purchasing	it,	and	if	 I	ever	find	you	fiddling	with	her,	you	know
my	 temper	 --	 then	 I	will	not	 remember	whether	you	are	my	 friend	or	not.	My
gun	is	always	loaded."
The	friend	said,	"You	are	getting	unnecessarily	hot;	let	the	time	come.	Let	us	go
--	you	put	the	woman	in	your	suitcase."
The	 man	 who	 had	 the	 woman	 enjoyed	 the	 woman	 very	 much,	 and	 the	 other
fellow	forgot	all	about	Nobel	Prizes;	he	felt	very	lonely.	One	day	when	the	friend
had	gone	out,	he	pumped	up	the	woman	...	When	the	other	fellow	came	back	he
saw	 the	woman	 flying	out	of	 the	window.	He	came	 inside	 and	he	 said,	 "What
happened?	Why	has	the	woman	flown	out	of	the	window?"
He	 said,	 "I	 forgot,	 and	 I	 bit	 on	her	 breast	 too	hard;	 the	 air	 leaked	out	 and	 the
woman	 simply	 jumped!"	 True	 to	 his	 word,	 the	 man	 simply	 shot	 his	 friend
immediately.
After	 a	 year	when	he	 came	back	 to	 the	village	 to	 collect	 things	 again,	 the	old
man	said,
"How	are	things	going	with	the	woman?"
He	said,	"It	is	a	very	sad	story.	You	will	have	to	supply	me	with	another	woman	-
-	but	that	one	was	a	very	rare	model."
The	shopkeeper	asked,	"And	what	happened	to	your	friend?"
He	said,	"I	told	him	from	the	very	beginning,	'Don't	fiddle	with	my	woman!'	And
that	 idiot	bit	on	her	breast	so	deeply	that	she	flew	out	of	 the	window.	And	she
flew	out	just	when	I	was	coming	back,	so	I	shot	the	man.	Now	you	can	give	me
another	woman	and	we	will	live	in	peace.	And	I	have	discovered	a	great	truth:	it
is	 better	 than	 a	 real	woman,	 because	 there	 is	 no	harassment,	 no	nagging.	And
whenever	you	want	to	fold	it	you	can;	it	is	so	convenient.	It	never	says,	'I	have	a
headache.'	It	is	always	available	..."
My	feeling	is	that	if	there	is	a	God	and	there	is	a	paradise,	then	those	saints	must
have	 been	 playing	with	 plastic	women	 for	 centuries.	Real	women	 anyway	 are
not	 allowed	 to	 go	 to	 heaven.	 No	 religion	 allows	 women	 to	 go	 to	 heaven,	 so
naturally	that	is	the	only	alternative,	a	plastic	woman.	And	the	poor	saints,	they
can't	afford	a	real	woman;	they	could	not	manage	here	--	how	can	they	manage
there?
They	 escaped	 from	 the	 world	 --	 in	 fact	 they	 escaped	 from	 the	 woman.	 'The
world'	is	just	the	name.	When	they	say	somebody	has	renounced	the	world,	they
mean	he	has	renounced	the	woman.	The	world?	Where	are	you	going?	Wherever
you	go	it	is	the	world;	nobody	can	renounce	the	world.
But	 people	 call	 it	 'renouncing	 the	 world'	 to	 hide	 the	 fact	 that	 it	 is	 simply
renouncing	 the	 woman.	 And	without	 renouncing	 the	 woman	 you	 cannot	 be	 a
saint.	It	is	a	tragedy	that	you	renounce	a	real	woman,	and	in	paradise	you	get	a
plastic	woman	with	a	pump.
I	 don't	 believe	 that	 you	 should	 think	 of	 any	 positive	 achievement	 through
meditation.	You	won't	 get	 any	God,	because	what	will	 you	do	with	God?	You
both	will	feel	very	awkward.

After	 saying,	 "Hi!"	what	 are	you	going	 to	 say	 to	God?	All	 the	miseries	of	 the
world	that	he	has	created	...	This	is	the	worst	kind	of	world	that	anybody	could
have	created.
I	 had	 an	 old	Mohammedan	 tailor.	 I	 used	 to	 go	 to	 different	 cities,	 lecturing	 in
different	universities.	I	told	the	old	man	--	he	was	a	very	nice	guy	--	I	told	him,
"I	am	going	in	six	days,	so	you	have	to	prepare	my	clothes;	give	the	priority	to
my	clothes,	put	everything	else	away."
He	said,	"Listen.	Do	you	know	that	God	created	the	world	in	six	days?"
I	said,	"What	has	that	to	do	with	my	clothes?"
He	said,	"It	has	something	to	do	with	it.	Look	at	the	world	--	it	is	in	a	mess!	If
you	want	your	clothes	to	be	made	in	six	days,	then	don't	complain	--	they	will	be
a	mess."
What	are	you	going	to	say	to	God?	Perhaps	you	have	never	thought	about	it,	that
it	will	be	a	very	awkward	encounter.	And	what	are	you	going	 to	do	with	your
paradise?	 It	 is	 a	 question	 of	 eternity;	 forever	 and	 forever	 the	 same	 plastic
women,	and	the	same	dirty	wine	flowing	in	the	rivers.	And	I	know	perfectly	well
that	Indians	must	have	reached	there,	and	they	will	be	doing	all	kinds	of	nasty
things	--	that	wine	is	no	more	of	any	use.
So	please,	settle	for	no-self.

MASTER,
RINZAI	SAID:
FOLLOWERS	OF	THE	TAO,	I	AM	TALKING	ONLY	ABOUT	THAT	WHICH
IS
DISTINCTLY	 SOLITARY	 AND	 BRIGHT,	 AND	 IS	 LISTENING	 TO	 MY
EXPOUNDING
OF	 THE	 DHARMA.	 THIS	 ONE	 KNOWS	 NO	 OBSTRUCTIONS	 AND	 IS
OMNIPRESENT
IN	THE	THREE	WORLDS	OF	EXISTENCE	IN	THE	TEN	DIRECTIONS	OF
SPACE.	IT
CAN	 FREELY	 AND	 COMFORTABLY	 ENTER	 ALL	 THE	 DIFFERENT
STATES,	WITHOUT	BEING	INFECTED	BY	THEM.
IN	THE	SHORTEST	INSTANT,	IT	WILL	PENETRATE	DEEPLY	INTO	THE
DHARMA-DHATU	 WHERE	 IT	 WILL	 TALK	 ABOUT	 BUDDHAS,	 WHEN
MEETING
BUDDHAS;	 ABOUT	 PATRIARCHS,	 WHEN	 MEETING	 PATRIARCHS;
ABOUT
ARHATS,	WHEN	MEETING	ARHATS,	AND	ABOUT	HUNGRY	GHOSTS,
WHEN
MEETING	HUNGRY	GHOSTS.
IT	WILL	 GO	 TO	 ALL	 PLACES	 AND	 JOURNEY	 TO	 LANDS	WHERE	 IT
WILL
CONVERT	 THE	 LIVING.	 IT	 HAS	 NEVER,	 EVEN	 FOR	 THE	 TIME	 OF	 A
THOUGHT,	 STRAYED	 FROM	 OMNIPRESENT	 PURITY	 AND
CLEANNESS,	SHINING	THROUGH
THE	 TEN	DIRECTIONS	OF	 SPACE,	WHERE	MYRIAD	 THINGS	ARE	 IN
THE	STATE
OF	 SUCHNESS.	 FOLLOWERS	 OF	 THE	 TAO,	MEN	 OF	 ABILITY	 KNOW
ONLY	NOW
THAT	 FUNDAMENTALLY	 THERE	 IS	 NO	 CAUSE	 WHATEVER	 FOR
CONCERN.	IT	IS
JUST	 BECAUSE	 YOU	 DO	 NOT	 UNDERSTAND	 THIS,	 THAT	 EVERY
THOUGHT	OF
YOURS	 IS	 DIRECTED	 TO	 THE	 PURSUIT	 OF	 EXTERNALS,	 LIKE	 ONE
WHO	REJECTS
HIS	OWN	HEAD	TO	LOOK	FOR	ANOTHER;	HENCE	YOUR	 INABILITY
TO	APPLY
THE	BRAKE	TO	YOUR	THOUGHTS.
...	WHAT	THIS	MOUNTAIN	MONK	IS	TALKING	ABOUT	IS	JUST	AN
APPROPRIATE	MEDICINE	TO	CURE	A	PARTICULAR	AILMENT	OF	THE
MOMENT
BECAUSE	 THERE	 IS	NO	 FIXED	DHARMA.	 THE	HOLDER	OF	 SUCH	A
VIEW	 IS	A	 TRUE	LEAVER	OF	HOME,	AND	CAN	ENJOY	HIMSELF	 TO
THE	FULLEST,	AS	IF	HE
WERE	SPENDING,	EVERY	DAY,	TEN	THOUSAND	OUNCES	OF	YELLOW
GOLD	ON
HIS	PLEASURES.
Maneesha,	 Rinzai	 has	 a	 special	 place	 just	 as	 Bodhidharma	 has.	 Bodhidharma
introduced	Zen	 to	China	 from	India,	 and	Rinzai	 introduced	Zen	 to	 Japan	 from
China.	These	two	were	key	figures	in	creating	a	whole	new	approach	to	reality.
You	 will	 see,	 at	 some	 points,	 it	 is	 so	 difficult	 not	 to	 say	 that	 this	 man	 has
certainly	seen	the	original	face.	He	is	not	philosophizing,	although	his	words	are
that	of	a	philosopher.
It	 is	a	strange	fate	that	when	a	philosopher	turns	to	the	world	of	Zen,	he	never
shows	exactly	what	Zen	is.	He	goes	roundabout.	He	does	not	show	Zen	directly,
immediately,	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
105
Chapter	9	-	Lovers	of	tao
because	 of	 his	 old	 training.	 For	 an	 ordinary	 human	 being	 who	 has	 not	 been
trained	in	philosophy	it	is	far	easier	to	understand	Zen.	Rinzai	was	unfortunate	in
the	 sense	 that	 he	 was	 professionally	 a	 philosopher.	 So	 what	 can	 be	 said	 in	 a
single	sentence,	he	goes	on	elaborating	about,	around	and	around;	you	have	 to
find	that	single	sentence	almost	in	a	forest	of	words.
He	cannot	forget	his	old	habit	of	conceptualization	--	he	tries	his	best.
This	 was	 not	 the	 case	 with	 Mahakashyapa	 who	 created	 Zen.	 He	 was	 not	 a
philosopher,	 he	was	 a	 very	 simple,	 innocent	man.	And	Zen	was	 born	 out	 of	 a
laughter	--	that	you	should	never	forget	--	because	Mahakashyapa	laughed	at	the
very	stupidity	of	a	philosopher	asking	a	question	about	the	ultimate	reality.	You
can	ask	questions	about	relative	reality,	about	the	outside	world,	and	you	can	get
answers,	too.	All	the	encyclopedias	are	full	of	those	answers.
But	you	cannot	raise	a	question	about	your	inner	reality.	There	is	no	question	and
no	answer.
There	is	absolute	silence;	no	dust	is	raised,	just	a	pure,	clean	sky.	What	question
can	you	make	out	of	it?
Philosophy	in	a	way	avoids	the	inner	world	because	in	the	inner	world	there	is
no	place	for	philosophy.	It	talks	about	God	and	it	talks	about	paradise	and	it	talks
about	 a	 thousand	 and	 one	 things,	 just	 avoiding	 one	 thing	 --	 yourself.	 In	 other
words,	philosophy	is	an	avoidance	of	reality,	not	an	inquiry	into	reality.
Rinzai	tried	his	hardest	to	forget	the	old	training	of	his	mind,	and	once	in	a	while
he	 succeeded.	 There	 was	 no	 difficulty	 for	 Bodhidharma.	 He	 never	 knew	 any
scripture,	 he	 never	 knew	 any	 philosophy.	 He	 was	 a	 pure,	 original	 man	 --
uncultured,	uncultivated,	absolutely	raw.
Zen	fits	with	the	original,	uncultured,	unsophisticated	very	well,	because	Zen	is
a	gesture.	All	philosophies	are	linguistic.
Zen	has	a	totally	different	language	of	the	presence	of	the	master,	of	allowing	his
experience	to	filter	into	your	being,	of	receiving	with	joy	his	song	of	silence,	of
being	 blessed	 when	 the	 master	 is	 showering	 all	 his	 blessings	 ...	 like	 flowers
falling	 on	 you	with	 invisible	mysteries.	 Zen	 has	 to	 create	 a	 totally	 existential
language.	Our	ordinary	 language	 is	good	enough	for	 theology,	 for	 religion,	 for
philosophy,	but	not	for	Zen.
I	will	tell	you	when	he	goes	into	his	old	habits,	and	when	he	remembers	to	come
back	to	directly	pointing	to	the	truth.
RINZAI	SAID:
FOLLOWERS	OF	THE	TAO	...
Now,	this	is	...	from	the	very	beginning	he	commits	a	mistake.	Not	intentionally	-
-	he	is	a	great	lover	of	Buddha	and	Lao	Tzu,	of	Tao	and	Dhamma.	Dhamma	is
Buddha's	finger	pointing	to	the	moon,	and	Tao	is	Lao	Tzu's	finger	pointing	to	the
same	moon.	Only	the	fingers	differ.	That's	why	Buddhism	never	came	to	clash
with	Taoism	when	it	reached	China.
This	 is	 a	 rare	 incident	 in	 history.	 Whenever	 one	 religion	 travels	 there	 is
immediately	 conflict	 with	 the	 existing	 religion	 --	 naturally,	 because	 their
concepts	differ.	This	is	the	only	instance	in	the	whole	of	history	where	this	did
not	happen,	when	Buddhism	reached	China	and	was	welcomed	by	the	Taoists.	It
is	a	phenomenal	thing,	it	is	absolutely	unique	and	rare.
Do	you	think	Christianity	will	welcome	Hinduism	in	the	same	way,	or	Hinduism
will	 welcome	 Mohammedanism	 in	 the	 same	 way,	 or	 Mohammedanism	 will
welcome	 Judaism	 in	 the	 same	 way?	 They	 have	 all	 been	 in	 conflict,	 arguing,
fighting,	killing,	burning	for	fictitious	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
106
Chapter	9	-	Lovers	of	tao
concepts	which	have	no	evidence	of	existence	at	all.	This	is	the	only	instance	in
the	whole	of	history,	where	 the	 lovers	of	Tao	 simply	welcomed	Bodhidharma.
They	saw	that	 the	finger	 is	different	but	 the	moon	is	 the	same,	and	to	fight	for
fingers	is	absolutely	idiotic.	They	are	all	pointing	to	the	same	moon.
Rinzai	commits	his	first	mistake	because	Tao	does	not	allow	any	followers.	You
can	love	Tao,	you	can	live	Tao,	but	you	cannot	be	a	follower	--	because	Tao	is
not	an	ordinary	religion.
It	 is	not	a	church,	 it	has	no	organized	discipline.	 It	 is	 the	path	of	very	unique,
eccentric	people.
You	cannot	fall	into	the	trap	of	following	because	there	is	nothing	to	follow	--	no
doctrine,	no	discipline,	no	special	way	to	reach	to	the	truth.
And	further	on	he	says	that	Dhamma	is	not	fixed;	Dhamma	and	Tao	are	exactly
equivalent.	 If	Dhamma	 is	not	 fixed,	 how	can	you	 follow	 it?	You	can	 follow	a
thing	 which	 is	 dead	 and	 fixed,	 but	 Tao	 is	 a	 living	 phenomenon.	 It	 has	 no
scripture,	 it	has	only	a	deep,	personal	 intimacy	which	is	handed	down,	hand	to
hand,	 from	 master	 to	 disciple.	 The	 same	 is	 true	 of	 Zen.	 It	 is	 a	 transmission,
invisible	 to	 outsiders,	 because	 it	 is	 a	 heart	meeting	 another	 heart,	 joining	 in	 a
dance,	falling	into	the	same	rhythm.
You	 cannot	 call	 these	 people	 followers.	 I	 cannot	 call	 my	 people	 followers
because	 there	 are	 no	 rules	 to	 follow.	 You	 are	 not	 here	 to	 follow	 a	 certain
doctrine,	as	Christians	are	doing	in	churches,	you	are	here	simply	to	experience
your	own	self.	It	 is	easier	when	there	are	so	many	people	engaged	in	the	same
search	of	their	inner	reality.	It	creates	a	magnetic	field.	In	that	magnetic	field	it	is
easier	 for	you	 to	 relax,	 it	 is	 easier	 for	you	not	 to	doubt.	 It	 is	 easier	 for	you	 to
enter	into	yourself,	seeing	that	so	many	people	are	entering;	there	is	no	fear.
Tao	is	an	energy	field	which	is	being	transferred	from	master	to	disciple.	And	the
moment	it	is	transferred,	the	disciple	becomes	a	master	in	his	own	right.	Now	he
has	his	own	field	of	energy.	Energy	is	invisible;	only	its	effects	are	visible.	You
can	 see	 light,	 but	 you	 cannot	 see	 electricity.	 Have	 you	 ever	 seen	 electricity?
These	lights	are	just	the	effects	of	electricity.
Electricity	 can	do	 a	 thousand	 and	one	 things,	 but	 nobody	has	 ever	 seen	 it	 and
nobody	will	ever	see	it.
Energy	is	not	something	to	be	seen,	but	only	felt.	Have	you	seen	love?	You	may
have	seen	lovers	--	even	that	is	very	difficult	--	but	to	see	love	...	You	yourself
may	even	be	in	love	--
you	 can	 have	 a	 subtle	 feeling	 of	 a	 great	 change	 in	 your	 behavior.	 You	 walk
differently,	your	eyes	have	a	different	gleam,	you	smile	in	a	more	understanding
way,	you	relate	with	other	people	with	grace	--	but	these	are	all	effects.	One	can
act	all	these	effects	without	having	love	at	all.
I	have	heard	...	Mulla	Nasruddin's	wife	drags	him	to	a	movie	house.	And	in	the
picture	which	 is	 shown	 the	 hero	 hugs	 and	 kisses	 the	 heroine	 so	 gracefully,	 so
sweetly,	 that	 immediately	Mulla	Nasruddin's	wife	 turns	 to	him	and	 says,	 "You
never	do	that	to	me."
Mulla	Nasruddin	said,	"You	don't	understand	--	he	is	paid.	Am	I	paid?"
But	 the	wife	was	also	a	rare	personality.	She	said,	"Paid	or	not	paid,	you	don't
know	that	in	real	life	also	they	are	husband	and	wife."
Mulla	said,	"My	god!	If	in	real	life	also	they	are	husband	and	wife,	then	he	is	a
great	actor.
I	can	certify	that	he	is	a	great	actor."	Showing	so	much	sweetness	to	one's	own
wife	--	who	has	ever	heard	of	it?
You	can	act.	People	have	acted	as	if	they	are	enlightened,	knowing	perfectly	well
inside	 that	 it	 is	 just	 acting.	But	 followers	 are	 not	 possible.	Gautam	Buddha	 is
reported	to	have	said,	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
107
Chapter	9	-	Lovers	of	tao
"Watch	me,	feel	me,	but	don't	follow	me."	You	have	to	find	your	own	path	alone.
And	that	is	a	great	beauty,	that	your	enlightenment	will	be	fresh	and	virgin,	not
second	hand.
There	are	no	followers	of	Tao,	but	Rinzai	is	a	man	of	philosophy	where	there	are
only	followers.	In	Tao,	in	Zen,	in	Dhamma,	there	are	only	lovers	...	 love	at	the
highest	 peak,	 where	 you	 open	 your	 heart	 to	 the	 unknown	 realities,	 to	 the
unknown	invisible	mysteries	of	your	own	being.	It	is	a	trust	certainly,	but	not	a
following.
Remember,	trust	is	not	a	belief.	These	things	I	have	to	remind	you	of	again	and
again,	 because	 all	 your	 dictionaries	 are	misleading.	 I	 have	 not	 come	 across	 a
single	dictionary	or	encyclopedia	which	is	not	mixed	up	and	confused	about	trust
and	belief.
Belief	is	in	a	system	of	thoughts	and	trust	is	the	essence	of	love.	You	can	trust
only	a	living	being;	you	can	believe	in	a	dead	scripture.	Trust	simply	means	that
you	 have	 already	 tasted	 something	 and	 you	 have	 heard	 the	 call	 of	 the	master
..."Come	closer,	be	more	intimate.
I	 can	 show	 you	 my	 inner	 world	 in	 order	 to	 help	 you	 to	 see	 your	 own	 inner
world."	The	function	of	 the	master	 is	 to	provoke	a	quest	 in	you	for	your	 inner
treasures.
There	are	no	followers	of	Tao.
There	are	only	lovers.
Rinzai	says:
I	AM	TALKING	ABOUT	THAT	WHICH	IS	DISTINCTLY	SOLITARY	AND
BRIGHT
AND	IS	LISTENING	TO	MY	EXPOUNDING	OF	THE	DHARMA.	THIS	ONE
KNOWS
NO	OBSTRUCTIONS	AND	 IS	OMNIPRESENT	 IN	THE	THREE	WORLDS
OF
EXISTENCE	IN	THE	TEN	DIRECTIONS	OF	SPACE.	IT	CAN	FREELY	AND
COMFORTABLY	 ENTER	 ALL	 THE	 DIFFERENT	 STATES,	 WITHOUT
BEING
INFECTED	BY	THEM.
This	I	call	philosophical	--	going	round	and	round.	In	this	whole	passage	what	he
is	saying	is	simply,	"Look	into	yourself.	The	reality	of	your	being	is	as	big	as	all
ten	dimensions.
Nothing	 can	 penetrate	 it	 and	 nothing	 can	 burn	 it,	 nothing	 can	 steal	 it."	 If
Bodhidharma	was	 to	 say	 it,	 he	would	 simply	hit	 you	with	his	 sandal,	 and	 that
would	be	enough.	"It	is	you,	there	is	no	need	to	go	on	talking	about	it."	Why	not
wake	you	up	directly?
IN	THE	SHORTEST	INSTANT,	says	Rinzai,	IT	WILL	PENETRATE	DEEPLY
INTO
THE	DHARMA-DHATU.
The	 poor	 fellow	 cannot	 forget	 his	 philosophy.	 Now,	 DHARMA-DHATU	 is
simply	 a	 philosophical	way	 to	 say,	 enter	 into	 your	 fundamental	 nature.	Rather
than	saying	 that	 --	enter	 into	your	 fundamental	nature	 --	he	brings	 in	 the	word
dharma-dhatu.	To	the	fools	these	strange	words	sound	very	profound	--	the	man
must	know,	must	be	a	great	buddha:	dharma-dhatu!
And	it	does	not	mean	much,	it	simply	means	your	foundation.
WHERE	 IT	 WILL	 TALK	 ABOUT	 BUDDHAS,	 WHEN	 MEETING
BUDDHAS;	ABOUT
PATRIARCHS	WHEN	MEETING	PATRIARCHS,	ABOUT	ARHATS,	WHEN
MEETING
ARHATS,	 AND	ABOUT	HUNGRY	GHOSTS	WHEN	MEETING	HUNGRY
GHOSTS.
Now	you	can	see	how	philosophy	goes	on	creating	great	systems	of	thought	and
belief.
Your	 very	 foundation	 is	 certainly	 the	 foundation	 of	 all	 the	 buddhas;	 your
ultimate	 consciousness	 is	 the	 source	 of	 all	 the	 buddhas.	 A	 single	 sentence	 is
enough,	that	you	are	containing	a	buddha	within	you.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
108
Chapter	9	-	Lovers	of	tao
And	as	far	as	hungry	ghosts	are	concerned,	I	cannot	agree	with	him.	There	are
hungry	 people,	 but	 hungry	 ghosts?	 There	 is	 no	 reason	 for	 them	 to	 be	 hungry,
they	can	eat	 in	any	restaurant	without	paying	--	and	they	do	it.	You	cannot	see
them,	so	they	can	enter	anywhere;	locks	and	doors	don't	matter.	This	is	a	stupid
idea	he	must	have	got	from	his	childhood	which	is	still	hanging	around	--	hungry
ghosts!	To	frighten	a	child	just	a	ghost	is	enough,	but	to	make	it	hungry	means,
"Beware!"	 A	 hungry	 ghost	 immediately	 gulps	 you.	 One	moment	 you	 are	 and
next	 moment	 you	 are	 gone.	 I	 know	 ghosts,	 but	 I	 have	 never	 heard	 ..."Poor
ghosts,	 hungry	 ghosts."	 There	 is	 no	 reason	 for	 them	 to	 be	 hungry	 --	 just
something	to	frighten	children	...
But	Rinzai	is	still	carrying	his	own	childhood.	There	are	no	ghosts	in	the	world,
but	all	the	religions	talk	about	ghosts	because	their	very	foundation	is	dependent
on	a	belief	 in	God.	And	if	people	start	asking	questions	about	God's	existence,
they	 are	 immediately	 repressed:	 "Even	 to	 disbelieve	 or	 doubt	 for	 a	 single
moment	about	God	you	will	be	in	trouble."	The	ghosts	come	in	the	same	line.
God	lives	far	away;	ghosts	live	just	in	the	neighborhood.	They	may	be	living	in
your	own	house.	To	frighten	children	with	a	God	who	lives	far	away	--	no	child
is	so	unintelligent	to	be	afraid.	By	the	time	the	message	reaches	to	him	the	child
will	think,	"We	will	see.	But	first,	bring	the	ice	cream	from	the	refrigerator."	But
hungry	 ghosts?	 They	 may	 be	 in	 the	 refrigerator	 itself	 enjoying	 all	 your	 ice
cream!
But	a	man	like	Rinzai	talking	about	hungry	ghosts	simply	shows	that	even	if	you
grow	older	the	child	within	you	remains.	And	then	he	became	very	learned	in	his
scriptures,	 so	 the	 scriptures	 and	 the	 childhood	 superstitions	 all	 got	 mixed	 up.
Finally	he	became	enlightened,	but	his	whole	past	was	still	hanging	around	him
like	shadows.	And	when	he	starts	talking	about	religion	he	has	to	come	down	to
the	mind,	and	the	mind	is	full	of	those	shadows	of	the	past.
He	says:
IT	WILL	 GO	 TO	 ALL	 PLACES	 AND	 JOURNEY	 TO	 LANDS	WHERE	 IT
WILL
CONVERT	 THE	 LIVING.	 IT	 HAS	 NEVER,	 EVEN	 FOR	 THE	 TIME	 OF	 A
THOUGHT,	 STRAYED	 FROM	 OMNIPRESENT	 PURITY	 AND
CLEANNESS,	SHINING	THROUGH
THE	 TEN	DIRECTIONS	OF	 SPACE,	WHERE	MYRIAD	 THINGS	ARE	 IN
THE	STATE
OF	SUCHNESS.
Now	he	is	saying	something	of	experience.	He	knows	that	your	suchness,	your
nature,	your	Tao	is	immortal,	and	it	is	all	over	the	cosmos.
It	 is	 a	 very	 difficult	 job	 ...	 and	 I	 have	 suffered	 so	 much	 from	 these	 people.
Reading	 their	 scriptures,	 I	had	 to	 sort	out	what	was	 their	 childhood,	what	was
their	 training,	 what	 was	 their	 scripture	 knowledge,	 and	 what	 was	 their	 actual
experience	 --	 that	 was	 very	 small.	 And	 to	 search	 in	 a	 mountain	 for	 a	 small
diamond,	 it	 is	 really	 difficult.	 Now,	 what	 he	 is	 saying	 is	 true	 but	 still	 the
language	is	not	of	Zen.	The	language	is	of	philosophy.
IT	 HAS	 NEVER,	 EVEN	 FOR	 THE	 TIME	 OF	 A	 THOUGHT,	 STRAYED
FROM
OMNIPRESENT	 PURITY	 AND	 CLEANNESS,	 SHINING	 THROUGH	 THE
TEN
DIRECTIONS	OF	SPACE,	WHERE	MYRIAD	THINGS	ARE	IN	THE	STATE
OF
SUCHNESS.
Just	a	simple	sentence:	in	your	suchness	you	are	the	whole.	This	very	moment	if
you	become	aware	of	your	suchness,	you	are	not	separate	from	the	cosmos.	But
a	small	thing	Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
109
Chapter	9	-	Lovers	of	tao
philosophers	tend	to	make	much	fuss	about.	Philosophy	is	so	much	garbage	that
it	is	very	easy	to	forget	whether	the	philosopher	has	found	it	or	not.
Rinzai	 is	counted	as	a	great	philosopher	 in	 the	Japanese	history	of	philosophy.
He	should	not	be,	but	his	words	give	the	 impression	that	he	 is	a	philosopher.	I
want	to	say	that	he	is	a	mystic	who	does	not	know	the	language	of	the	mystics.
He	 is	 a	 mystic	 who	 knows	 the	 language	 of	 philosophy,	 and	 then	 everything
becomes	unnecessarily	pompous.
Again	he	says:
FOLLOWERS	OF	THE	TAO,	MEN	OF	ABILITY	KNOW	ONLY	NOW	THAT
FUNDAMENTALLY	THERE	IS	NO	CAUSE	WHATEVER	FOR	CONCERN.
He	is	saying	a	great	truth,	but	again	using	wrong	words.	Followers	don't	exist	in
the	 world	 of	 the	 buddhas	 --	 only	 lovers,	 only	 those	 who	 are	 ready	 to	 expose
themselves	 to	 their	 very	 core.	Otherwise	what	 he	 is	 saying	 is	 significant.	 Just
change	'followers'	into	'lovers	of	Tao'.
MEN	OF	ABILITY	KNOW	ONLY	NOW	THAT	FUNDAMENTALLY	THERE
IS	NO
CAUSE	WHATEVER	FOR	CONCERN.
But	it	has	still	to	be	reduced	to	a	more	Zen	way,	to	a	more	Zen	language.	He	is
saying	that	when	you	become	a	buddha,	you	know	that	 there	was	no	cause	for
concern.	Even	 if	you	are	not	a	buddha	 there	 is	no	cause	 for	concern.	Your	not
being	a	buddha	is	only	a	small	sleep,	just	a	little	dream.	In	the	eternity	of	time	it
does	not	matter	that	you	dreamed	for	few	a	seconds.
Our	whole	lives	are	so	small	in	comparison	to	eternity	that	nothing	matters,	but
this	 is	 known	 only	 to	 people	who	 have	 come	 to	 suchness,	who	 have	 come	 to
realization	of	their	center	of	being.
Suddenly,	 for	 them	 nothing	 matters.	 All	 judgments	 drop	 --	 nobody	 is	 good,
nobody	is	bad;	nobody	is	a	sinner	and	nobody	is	a	saint.	All	these	are	different
dreams	 people	 are	 having.	 One	 person	 is	 dreaming	 that	 he	 is	 a	 thief,	 another
person	is	dreaming	that	he	is	a	saint.	When	they	wake	up,	both	will	be	the	same.
And	the	difference	in	dreams	is	not	much	of	a	difference;	hence	his	statement	is
absolutely	correct,	 that	men	of	understanding	know	perfectly	well	 that	 there	 is
no	reason	for	concern.
IT	IS	JUST	BECAUSE	YOU	DO	NOT	UNDERSTAND	THIS,	THAT	EVERY
THOUGHT	OF	YOURS	IS	DIRECTED	TO	THE	PURSUIT	OF	EXTERNALS,
LIKE	ONE
WHO	 REJECTS	 HIS	 OWN	 HEAD	 TO	 LOOK	 FOR	 ANOTHER;	 HENCE
YOUR
INABILITY	TO	APPLY	THE	BRAKE	TO	YOUR	THOUGHTS.
WHAT	 THIS	 MOUNTAIN	 MONK	 IS	 TALKING	 ABOUT	 IS	 JUST	 AN
APPROPRIATE
MEDICINE	 TO	 CURE	 A	 PARTICULAR	 AILMENT	 OF	 THE	 MOMENT,
BECAUSE
THERE	IS	NO	FIXED	DHARMA.
Now,	 this	 is	 something	very	original	 that	he	 is	 saying.	THERE	IS	NO	FIXED
DHARMA,	so	 there	 is	no	question	of	following	somebody.	It	may	be	right	 for
him	to	do	something;	it	may	not	be	right	for	you	to	do	the	same	thing	because
you	are	a	different	individual,	in	a	different	context,	in	a	different	time.	You	have
to	 find	 your	 own	 truth	 and	 act	 accordingly	 --	 not	 according	 to	 anybody	 else's
truth.	There	is	no	certainty,	stability,	permanence	in	the	world	of	existence.	But
one	thing	he	forgets,	or	perhaps	is	not	aware	of.
He	is	saying:
WHAT	 THIS	 MOUNTAIN	 MONK	 IS	 TALKING	 ABOUT	 IS	 JUST	 AN
APPROPRIATE
MEDICINE	TO	CURE	A	PARTICULAR	AILMENT	OF	THE	MOMENT.
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
110
Chapter	9	-	Lovers	of	tao
On	a	very	low	level	the	statement	is	right,	but	from	the	heights	of	a	buddha,	the
ailment	is	as	illusory	as	the	medicine.
You	are	suffering	from	illusions.	Certainly	you	need	a	cure,	but	the	cure	has	to
be	as	illusory	as	your	suffering;	otherwise	it	will	disturb	rather	than	help.	Once
your	ailment	is	cured	you	don't	keep	the	bottle	of	medicine	with	you,	you	throw
it	away.
The	 people	 who	 go	 on	 carrying	 their	 scriptures	 are	 carrying	 medicines
prescribed	 perhaps	 five	 thousand	 years	 before	 to	 a	 certain	 person,	 who	 was
certainly	suffering	from	an	illusory	ailment.	The	prescription	you	are	carrying	...
the	 time	 has	 changed,	 so	much	water	 has	 gone	 down	 the	Ganges.	You	 are	 no
longer	living	in	the	world	where	the	BHAGAVADGITA	had	a	truth,	or	the	Bible
had	 a	 truth.	 The	 whole	 world	 has	 changed,	 but	 you	 cling	 to	 your	 medicine
bottles,	and	you	are	no	longer	suffering	from	those	ailments.	Now	the	medicine
has	become	your	illness.
THE	HOLDER	OF	SUCH	A	VIEW	 IS	A	TRUE	LEAVER	OF	HOME,	AND
CAN
ENJOY	HIMSELF	TO	THE	FULLEST,	AS	IF	HE	WERE	SPENDING,	EVERY
DAY,	TEN
THOUSAND	OUNCES	OF	YELLOW	GOLD	ON	HIS	PLEASURES.
It	 is	 true	 that	 a	man	 of	 enlightenment	 lives	 each	moment	 in	 such	 bliss	 and	 in
such	splendor	--
AS	 IF	 HE	 WERE	 SPENDING	 TEN	 THOUSAND	 OUNCES	 OF	 YELLOW
GOLD	ON
HIS	PLEASURES.
He	is	not	spending	a	single	paisa	but	what	Rinzai	is	saying	is	that	his	blissfulness
is	far	bigger	than	any	emperor.	He	may	be	a	beggar,	but	his	inner	silence	and	his
inner	peace	and	his	inner	dance	is	far	bigger	than	any	Alexander	the	Great.
Rinzai	has	to	be	understood	with	very	open	eyes.	He	is	carrying	all	his	childhood
superstitions,	 he	 is	 carrying	 all	 that	 he	 has	 learned	 as	 a	 student	 of	 philosophy,
and	he	has	attained	the	truth.	So	when	he	says	something	it	is	very	mixed	up.	It
is	not	pure	twenty-four	carat	gold;	it	has	some	truth	mixed	with	some	falseness.
Studying	Rinzai	is	arduous,	you	have	to	sift	it.	But	how	can	you	sift	it	unless	you
know?
My	own	understanding	is	that	people	should	read	scriptures	only	when	they	have
attained	to	the	truth.	In	fact,	then	there	is	no	need.	But	that	is	the	only	right	way,
because	 then	 they	can	see	what	 is	 false	and	what	 is	 right,	what	 is	superstitious
and	what	is	just	garbage.	There	may	be	a	small	truth	hidden	somewhere,	but	the
problem	is	that	those	who	have	attained	don't	read	and	those	who	read	have	not
attained.
I	have	read	much,	but	I	started	reading	after	my	attainment	because	before	that	I
simply	refused	...	Philosophers,	my	professors,	well-wishers	wanted	me	to	read
this	book,	that	book.	I	said,	"No.	Before	that	I	have	to	be	absolutely	certain	about
my	truth.	I	don't	have	any	criterion	to	judge	and	I	don't	want	to	get	confused	with
all	kinds	of	thoughts."	But	fortunately	the	enlightenment	came	very	early	to	me,
and	then	reading	was	an	absolute	joy	because	I	could	separate	the	false	from	the
true,	the	fictitious	from	the	real.
One	of	my	professors	used	to	say,	"Why	do	you	unnecessarily	waste	your	time	in
reading?"	Because	he	had	seen	my	books.	I	would	make	comments	on	my	books
--	that	this	is	stupid,	this	is	idiotic,	this	is	nonsense	carried	from	their	childhood.
He	said,	"Why	do	you	read	if	you	...	he	is	such	a	great	philosopher	and	you	are
making	such	comments."
I	said,	"Only	now	am	I	able	to	read	it."
Osho	-	The	Language	of	Existence
111
Chapter	9	-	Lovers	of	tao
This	is	a	strange	world.	When	you	are	able	to	read	there	is	no	point	in	reading,
and	 when	 you	 are	 incapable	 of	 reading	 you	 read	 too	 much	 and	 that	 goes	 on
creating	more	confusion	in	your	mind.
I	have	read	Rinzai,	and	I	have	found	that	it	is	very	rare	to	find	such	a	confused
enlightened	master.	He	certainly	did	a	great	job	--	others	have	to	sort	it	out.	But
at	least	he	carried	the	message	from	China	to	Japan.	Those	who	followed	Rinzai,
they	dropped	his	philosophy,	 they	dropped	his	 superstitions.	They	carried	only
the	pure,	clean	experience	of	consciousness.
Rinzai	 is	 still	worshipped.	He	has	his	own	school,	one	 thousand	years	after	he
was	alive.
But	the	masters	who	followed	really	did	a	good	sorting	out;	almost	ninety-nine
percent	of	Rinzai	has	been	dropped.	One	percent	is	so	true	that	you	cannot	drop
it.	But	he	was	not	the	man	to	express	only	that	one	percent,	he	made	much	fuss
about	it.	It	would	have	been	far	better	for	him	first	to	forget	his	philosophy,	drop
his	 superstitions,	 sort	 out	 for	 himself	what	 is	 actually	 his	 own	 experience	 and
then	give	an	expression	 to	 it.	But	others	have	 to	do	 this	 laundry	 job.	He	 left	a
mess	behind	him.
A	master,	Kansan,	of	the	same	lineage	as	Rinzai,	says	in	a	few	words	much	more
than	Rinzai's	big	discourses.
Kansan	says:
I	CLIMB	THE	ROAD	TO	COLD	MOUNTAIN,
THE	ROAD	TO	COLD	MOUNTAIN	THAT	NEVER	ENDS.
THE	VALLEYS	ARE	LONG	AND	STREWN	WITH	STONES;
THE	STREAMS	BROAD	AND	BANKED	WITH	THICK	GRASS.
THE	MOSS	IS	SLIPPERY,
THOUGH	NO	RAIN	HAS	FALLEN;
PINES	SIGH,	BUT	IT	IS	NOT	THE	WIND.
WHO	CAN	BREAK	FROM	THE	SNARES	OF	THE	WORLD,
AND	SIT	WITH	ME	AMONG	THE	WHITE	CLOUDS?
He	is	saying,	the	road	is	a	non-ending	road.	Your	inner	world	has	no	limitations
to	it.	Just	as	the	outer	universe	has	no	boundaries,	your	inner	world	also	has	no
inner	boundaries.	He	is	simply	describing	the	whole	path	he	has	moved	through.
I	CLIMB	THE	ROAD	TO	COLD	MOUNTAIN.
Because	as	you	go	deeper	it	becomes	colder	and	colder.	All	the	heat	is	sickness,
it	is	fever.

Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
LANGUAGE	 IS	 USUALLY	 ABOUT	 THE	 COMMUNICATION	 OR
TRANSFER	OF
IDEAS;	AND	THE	UNDERSTANDING	OF	MOST	RELIGIONS	SEEMS	TO
BE	THAT
ONE	DOES	NOT	NEED	TO	BE	GIVEN	SOMETHING.
HOWEVER,	ZEN	 IS	DIFFERENT	 IN	THAT	 IT	APPEARS	TO	BE	SAYING
ONE
ONLY	NEEDS	TO	UNDERSTAND	WHAT	ONE	ALREADY	HAS.	 IS	 THIS
WHY	YOU
HAVE	CALLED	ZEN	"THE	LANGUAGE	OF	EXISTENCE"?
Maneesha,	you	are	right.	Zen	has	nothing	to	give	to	you,	but	has	something	to
take	away	--
your	personality,	your	mask,	your	 false	 identities.	Zen	has	 to	 rip	you	away,	 so
that	 only	 the	 existence,	 pure	 existence	 remains	 unpolluted	 in	 you.	 It	 does	 not
bother	about	philosophizing.
Its	concern	is	experiencing,	its	concern	is	existential.	That's	why	I	have	called	it
"the	 language	 of	 existence."	 All	 other	 languages	 are	 man's	 languages	 --	 for
purposes	 of	 the	 mediocre	 and	 for	 purposes	 of	 the	 marketplace.	 Zen	 is	 not	 a
marketplace	phenomenon.	It	needs	a	tremendous	courage	to	enter	into	one's	own
existence,	leaving	everything	that	one	values	so	much.
It	 does	 not	want	 you	 to	 renounce	 the	world,	 it	 simply	wants	 you	 to	 renounce
yourself,	 and	 just	 let	 the	 existence	 express	 and	 radiate	 through	 you.	 The	 Zen
master,	or	buddha,	does	not	speak,	he	only	allows	existence	to	sing	its	song.	The
buddha	is	just	a	flute,	a	bamboo	with	holes.	Existence	can	sing	any	song	that	it
wants;	the	flute	does	not	interfere.	The	flute	allows	existence	to	commune	with
those	who	are	capable	of	listening	to	the	music	that	is	flowing	through	it.
Rinzai	has	been	a	very	serious	trip.	My	understanding	of	Zen	is	that	it	is	full	of
laughter	and	giggles.	It	is	not	a	serious	concern	at	all.
History	records	many	examples	of	people	in	restaurants	who	have	found	flies	in
their	soup.
Professor	 Dingleberry,	 a	 world	 famous	 authority,	 has	 run	 a	 survey	 on	 the
international	situation;	his	findings	are	revealing.
In	 America,	 if	 a	 diner	 finds	 a	 fly	 in	 his	 soup,	 he	 sends	 the	 dish	 back	 and
complains	to	the	manager.

In	English	 restaurants,	 the	 fly	 is	 carefully	 removed	between	 finger	and	 thumb,
placed	on	the	table,	and	then	politely	ignored	for	the	rest	of	the	meal.
In	France,	the	fly-finder	consumes	the	soup,	but	pushes	the	fly	to	the	side	of	the
plate.
In	Scotland,	the	fly	is	lifted	forcibly	out	of	the	soup	and	squeezed	over	the	plate,
then	dropped	to	the	ground	and	trodden	into	the	carpet.
The	Chinese	consume	the	fly	with	one	swallow,	and	then	wash	it	down	with	the
soup.
In	Jewish	restaurants,	particularly	in	New	York,	the	diner	immediately	sends	for
the	manager	and	complains,	"Is	this	all	I	get,	just	one	fly?"
Captain	 Cartwright	 Num-Nuts,	 the	 astute	 commander	 of	 the	 latest	 electronic
miracle	 battleship,	 the	 U.S.S.	 Turkey	 Shoot,	 proudly	 scans	 the	 horizon	 for
smoke.	He	is	standing	on	the	deck	of	his	observation	tower,	on	board	ship.
The	Turkey	Shoot	 is	 floating	a	 few	miles	 from	the	coast	of	Florida,	and	Num-
Nuts	 has	 just	 commanded	 the	 destruction	 of	 a	 mysterious	 aircraft	 flying	 too
nearby.
What	 he	 does	 not	 know	 is	 that	 he	 has	 just	 shot	 down	 the	 latest	 multi-billion
dollar	American	rocket	launched	to	explore	Mars.
Captain	Num-Nuts	 strides	 proudly	 up	 and	 down	 the	 deck,	 sniffing	 the	 salt	 air
and	 whistling	 the	 Turkey	 Shoot	 battle	 song,	 to	 celebrate	 his	 uncanny
marksmanship.
Suddenly,	an	aide	comes	running	up	 to	 the	captain.	"Here	 is	a	special	message
from	the	admiral,	sir,"	reports	the	sailor.
"Read	 it	 to	 me,	 my	 son,"	 says	 Num-Nuts,	 puffing	 out	 his	 chest,	 and	 gazing
towards	the	horizon.
"But,	sir,"	says	the	sailor,	"it	is	addressed	to	you	personally."
"Just	read	it	to	me,"	snaps	back	Captain	Num-Nuts.
The	 sailor	 reads,	 "Of	 all	 the	 blundering,	 stupid,	 idiotic	 morons,	 you	 take	 the
cake!"
Captain	Num-Nuts	shifts	his	gaze	to	the	sailor	and	pauses.	Then	he	says,	"Have
that	decoded	at	once!"
Luscious	Miss	Willing	starts	her	new	job	as	a	waitress	in	the	Goatburger	Cafe.
She	 approaches	 a	 table	 where	 Kowalski	 and	 Zabriski	 are	 sitting	 after	 just
finishing	their	meal.	She	leans	over	and,	cleaning	away	the	plates,	asks,	"What
would	you	gentlemen	like	for	dessert?"
"Uh,	 I	 would	 like	 raisin	 cake,"	 stammers	 Zabriski,	 noticing	 her	 full,	 white
breasts.
"Okay,"	she	says,	turning	to	Kowalski	and	leaning	all	the	way	over,	exposing	her
beautiful	tits.	"And	is	yours	raisin,	too?"
"Well,"	 says	Kowalski,	 looking	 down	 at	 the	 napkin	 on	 his	 lap.	 "Yup,	mine	 is
raisin'	too!"

Be	silent.	Close	your	eyes.
Feel	your	body	to	be	completely	frozen.
Gather	all	your	energy	inwards.
Look,	almost	like	an	arrow,
searching	deep	for	your	center	of	being,
because	your	center	of	being	is	also
the	center	of	the	universe.
One	who	knows	it	becomes	a	buddha.
Deeper	and	deeper	...
This	moment	is	precious.	You	are	very	close	to	your	own	being	and	to	the	being
of	the	universe.	Realizing	it	is	going	to	transform	your	whole	life.
Without	 any	 fear	 ...	 because	 it	 is	 your	 own	 territory,	 it	 is	 your	 own	 space.
Nobody	 can	 enter	 here.	 It	 has	 been	waiting	 for	 you	 for	millions	 of	 lives.	 Just
penetrate	it	and	you	will	find	the	greatest	blessing	showering	on	you.
To	make	it	more	clear,	Nivedano	...
(Drumbeat)
Relax,	let	go	of	the	body	and	the	mind.	You	are	just	a	watcher.	The	mind	may	be
creating	 some	dust,	 the	 body	may	be	 feeling	uncomfortable.	You	 are	 simply	 a
watcher.
Don't	 get	 identified,	 because	 this	 body	will	 change,	 this	mind	will	 change.	 A
thousand	 times	 they	have	already	changed.	Only	 this	watcher	 is	your	 treasure,
which	always	remains	...
eternity	to	eternity.
Lao	Tzu	calls	it	Tao.
Buddha	calls	it	Dhamma.
Whatever	the	name,
this	is	your	pure	existence.
It	 opens	 the	 doors	 of	 all	 the	mysteries	 --	mysteries	 that	 you	 can	 feel,	 but	 you
cannot	 say;	mysteries	 that	 you	 can	 sing,	 you	 can	dance,	 you	 can	 live,	 but	 you
cannot	say.	This	is	the	world	of	Zen,	and	experiencing	existence	is	its	language.
Blessed	is	this	evening.

Chapter	9	-	Lovers	of	tao
You	have	all	disappeared	into	an	oceanic	love,
into	an	oceanic	consciousness,
dissolving	your	thin	boundaries.
Remember	 this	 universal	 experience	 twenty-four	 hours,	 just	 like	 an
undercurrent.	Remain	a	buddha	--	walking	or	sitting,	sleeping	or	waking.
Nivedano	...
(Drumbeat)
Now	you	can	come	back,	but	come	back	not	the	same	as	you	had	gone	in.
Come	back	much	more	solid,
much	more	integrated,
much	more	centered,
and	then	sit	silently	for	a	few	moments
as	a	buddha.
Okay,	Maneesha?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.
Can	we	celebrate	the	gathering	of	ten	thousand	buddhas?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.
