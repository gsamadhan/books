OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
AN	OLD	MASTER	SAID:
TURN	 YOUR	 HEART	 ROUND	 AND	 ENTER	 THE	 ORIGIN.	 DO	 NOT
SEARCH	FOR
WHAT	 HAS	 SPRUNG	 OUT	 OF	 IT!	 WHEN	 YOU	 HAVE	 GAINED	 THE
ORIGIN,	WHAT
HAS	SPRUNG	OUT	OF	IT	WILL	COME	TO	YOU	OF	ITSELF.
IF	YOU	WANT	TO	KNOW	THE	ORIGIN,	THEN	PENETRATE	YOUR	OWN
ORIGINAL	HEART.	 THIS	HEART	 IS	 THE	 SOURCE	OF	ALL	 BEINGS	 IN
THE	WORLD
AND	 OUTSIDE	 THE	 WORLD.	 WHEN	 THE	 HEART	 STIRS,	 VARIOUS
THINGS	ARISE.
BUT	WHEN	THE	HEART	ITSELF	BECOMES	COMPLETELY	EMPTY,	THE
VARIOUS
THINGS	ALSO	BECOME	EMPTY.	 IF	YOUR	HEART	 IS	DRIVEN	ROUND
NEITHER	BY
GOOD	NOR	BAD,	THEN	ALL	THINGS	ARE	JUST	AS	THEY	ARE.
MASTER	OTSU,	COMMENTING	ON	THIS	 EMPTYING	OF	THE	HEART,
SAID:	 THE	 HEART	 BECOMES	 EMPTY,	 THE	 SITUATION	 QUIET,	 AND
THE	BODY	JUST
AS	IT	IS.	WHEN	SOMEONE	SUCCEEDS	IN	REACHING	THIS	POINT,	THE
MIRROR
OF	HIS	HEART	SHINES	CLEARLY	AND	HIS	NATURE	OPENS	WIDE	AND
CLEAR.	HE
LEAVES	 ERROR	 AND	 DOES	 NOT	 ATTACH	 HIMSELF	 TO	 TRUTH;	 HE
DWELLS
NEITHER	 IN	 ERROR	 NOR	 AWAKENING.	 HE	 IS	 NEITHER	 WORLDLY
NOR	SAINTLY.
ALL	WORLDLY	DESIRES	FALL	AWAY,	AND	AT	THE	SAME	TIME,	THE
MEANING
OF	SAINTLINESS	IS	EMPTIED	WITHOUT	RESIDUE.
SUCH	DETACHMENT	FROM	EVERYTHING	 IS	WHAT	MASTER	RINZAI
CALLED
"THE	COMPLETE	TAKING	AWAY	OF	BOTH,	OF	MAN	AND	SITUATION."
HERE	IS
EXPERIENCED	 ABSOLUTE	 NOT-NESS,	 SINCE	 SELF	 AND	 OBJECT
ALLOW
THEMSELVES	TO	COME	TO	NOTHING.
GENUINE	 ZEN	 EXPERIENCE	 CONSISTS	 EXCLUSIVELY	 IN	 THIS
"TAKING
AWAY	 OF	 MAN	 AND	 OBJECT."	 THIS	 COMPLETE	 NOT-NESS	 IS	 THE
ORIGINAL
PLACE	 FROM	WHICH	 ALL	 THINKING	 AND	 KNOWING	 SPRING.	 BUT
EVEN	IF	ONE
IS	 PERMITTED	 TO	 SPEAK	 OF	 A	 "PLACE"	 AT	 ALL,	 SUCH
TERMINOLOGY	IS	ONLY
PROVISIONAL.
EVEN	IF	ONE	WANTED	TO	CHARACTERIZE	IT	AS	UNBORN-NESS,	OR
AS
NIRVANA,	OR	AS	TRUTH,	ONE	COULD	NEVER	HIT	IT.	IT	LIES	BEYOND
ALL
TERMINOLOGY	AND	EXPRESSION;	THINKING	CANNOT	REACH	THAT
FAR.
Maneesha,	 there	 are	 four	 possible	 ways	 to	 explain	 the	 unexplainable.
Unconsciously,	man	has	made	philosophies	out	of	those	four	ways.
Man	is	a	crossroads,	where	four	ways	meet.	The	first	way	is	that	of	matter.	The
atheist	takes	that	road,	the	scientist	takes	that	road:	"Man	is	nothing	but	matter."
From	the	days	of	the	Osho	-	The	Miracle
2
Chapter	1	-	How	full,	emptiness!
charvakas	 to	 the	 days	 of	 Bertrand	 Russell,	 there	 have	 been	 great,	 eminent
thinkers	who	have	 chosen	 that	 path.	And	almost	 half	 of	 the	world	 today	 is	 on
that	 path,	 because	 communism	does	 not	 believe	 in	 anything	 else	 but	matter	 --
mind	is	only	an	epiphenomenon.
Epiphenomenon	 means	 just	 a	 shadow:	 when	 the	 man	 disappears,	 the	 shadow
disappears.
There	 is	 nothing	 beyond	 death,	 and	 there	 is	 nothing	 before	 birth.	 You	 are
complete	between	birth	and	death;	that's	all	you	have.
The	second	road	defines	man	as	a	duality	between	matter	and	mind.	Most	of	the
philosophers	 of	 the	 world	 have	 chosen	 that	 definition	 because	 it	 seems
completely	rational.
All	 that	we	know	about	man	 is	 that	his	body	consists	of	matter,	 and	we	know
that	he	has	thoughts	which	are	not	material.	These	things	can	be	observed	from
outside.	Hence,	man	is	basically	matter	with	an	addition	of	a	shadow	that	is	his
mind.	 As	 the	 body	 dies,	 mind	 also	 dies.	 On	 this	 path	 also,	 life	 extends	 only
between	birth	and	death.
The	third	possibility,	which	has	been	accepted	by	all	religions,	is	that	man	is	not
just	matter	or	just	mind;	he	is	also	a	soul.	Matter	is	his	outer	expression,	soul	is
his	 inner	 expression,	 and	mind	 functions	 as	 a	 bridge	 between	 the	 two.	On	 the
third	 path	 there	 is	 a	 possibility	 of	 a	 life	 beyond	 death.	 The	 people	 who	 have
accepted	it	have	created	on	this	foundation	the	idea	of	reincarnation:	birth	after
birth,	one	changes	houses	but	the	essential	soul	remains.
Zen	 has	 a	 fourth	 standpoint.	 Man	 is	 not	 matter,	 although	 he	 is	 covered	 with
matter.	He	is	not	mind,	although	he	is	covered	with	mind.	Nor	is	he	an	individual
soul.	He	 is	 a	pure	nothingness.	Man,	 from	 this	 fourth	 standpoint,	which	 is	 the
standpoint	of	Zen,	is	almost	like	an	onion.	You	go	on	peeling	it,	one	layer	after
another	 layer,	 hoping	 that	 you	 are	 going	 to	 find	 something.	Finally,	when	you
have	peeled	all	 the	 layers	off,	your	hands	are	full	of	emptiness;	nothing	is	 left.
The	onion	was	only	layers	and	layers	and	layers	and	layers.	Behind	those	layers
was	emptiness,	nothingness,	which	will	not	be	visible	to	the	eyes,	which	will	not
be	tangible	to	the	hands.
Zen	 has	 taken	 the	 ultimate	 standpoint	 about	man,	 you	 cannot	 go	 beyond	 that.
Here	ends	the	whole	journey,	the	pilgrimage	of	the	seeker.
Zen	wants	you	not	to	stop	at	matter.	Respect	it,	it	serves	you;	care	for	it,	it	cares
for	you.
You	are	not	the	mind	--	don't	make	it	a	master.	It	is	a	good	servant	--	use	it.	Use
it	 so	 that	 you	 can	 reach	 beyond	 it.	 It	 is	 a	 ladder	 to	 go	 beyond,	 but	 don't	 get
caught	up	with	it.
The	 "soul"	 is	 simply	 a	 consolation	 to	 people,	 because	 if	 you	 say	 to	 them	 that
meditation	will	 end	up	 in	nothingness	 ...	 In	a	million,	perhaps	one	person	will
become	interested	in	meditation.	And	if	you	tell	them,	"All	your	effort	will	come
to	a	vast	nothingness,"	you	will	frighten	them.	You	will	create	a	question	in	their
minds:	"Then	what	is	the	purpose?	We	are	--
at	least,	we	are.	Doing	meditation,	we	will	not	be."	It	is	going	to	be	the	ultimate
death.	Yes.
Gautam	Buddha	was	continually	asked,	 "Why	do	people	go	on	coming	 to	you
when	you	offer	nothing	but	nothingness?"
And	Buddha	said	many	times,	"Nothingness	is	not	just	no-thing-ness.	It	has	its
own	universality.	It	 is	becoming	as	vast	as	the	whole	universe,	unlimited.	Your
personality	is	too	small."
The	 people	 who	 are	 afraid	 of	 nothingness,	 of	 dissolving	 not	 only	 their
personality	but	their	individuality	too,	remain	with	the	third	standpoint.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	1	-	How	full,	emptiness!
The	third	is	very	consoling.	At	least	it	gives	you	something	to	hang	on	to.	Zen
does	not	give	you	anything;	it	simply	takes	away	all	the	layers	of	the	onion	and
then	says	to	you,	"Look,	this	is	you	--	just	pure	nothingness."
But	the	purity	of	it	is	so	overwhelming	that	you	are	not,	but	your	laughter	is.	You
are	not,	but	your	joy	is.	It	has	become	cosmic.	You	are	not,	but	your	ecstasy	is,
and	now	it	 is	not	confined	 to	a	small	area	of	your	personality	or	 individuality;
now	the	whole	of	existence	is	ecstatic.	The	birds	flying	and	the	flowers	opening
and	the	clouds	showering	--	everything	is	happening	in	the	deep	nothingness	of
your	realization	of	the	cosmic	emptiness	as	the	source	of	all	things.
Perhaps	 Zen	 alone	 has	 given	 a	 very	 scientific	 answer	 to	 the	 question.	 "From
where	do	things	come,	and	to	where	do	they	go	back?"	Even	science	shrugs	its
shoulders	the	moment	you	start	asking	them	questions	about	the	origin.	All	that
has	been	said	about	the	origin	by	the	religions,	by	the	scientific	people,	is	simply
guesswork.	Nobody	was	a	witness,	obviously.
How	can	there	be	a	witness	when	existence	has	not	started	yet?	You	will	come
later	on;	you	cannot	come	before.	And,	in	fact,	if	there	was	a	creator,	existence
was	already	there;	otherwise	how	can	the	creator	exist?
But	people	don't	go	to	such	depths.	They	don't	bother	about	that,	believing	in	a
God	who	created	the	world.	Why	don't	you	ask	who	created	God?	When	did	he
start	to	be?	His	family,	his	nationality,	his	race	--	any	trace?	Suddenly	he	comes
and	starts	creating	the	world.	Such	a	stupid	idea,	and	millions	have	believed	in	it,
and	still	believe	in	it.
Zen	is	very	clean	and	clear,	saying	that	there	has	been	no	beginning	at	all;	hence
the	 question	 of	 creation	 does	 not	 arise.	And	 there	 is	 not	 going	 to	 be	 any	 end;
hence	the	question	of	anybody	destroying	it,	God	or	Devil,	does	not	arise.	It	 is
always	here,	it	has	always	been	here,	and	it	will	always	be	here.	It	just	goes	on
playing	in	many	forms.	It	is	a	tremendous	drama.
If	you	understand	the	fourth	--
that	everything	comes	from	nothingness	...
If	you	can	return	to	nothingness	consciously
you	have	found	the	source.
That's	what	I	call	meditation:
returning	consciously	to	the	very	source
not	only	of	your	being
but	of	the	very	cosmos.
There	you	find	an	eternal	flame.
Things	come,	things	go.
Waves	arise,	and	waves	disappear.
But	everything	remains,
rooted	in	nothingness.
This	nothingness	is	very	miraculous	because	one	would	think	that	things	should
be	rooted	in	something.	But	if	you	ask	the	Zen	masters	if	things	should	be	rooted
in	something,	they	will	simply	laugh	and	ask,	"In	what	will	your	something	be
rooted?"
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	1	-	How	full,	emptiness!
You	cannot	ask	the	same	question	about	nothingness.	Nothingness	simply	means
nothingness,	there	is	no	question	of	any	roots.	It	neither	comes	nor	goes.	Nothing
happens	to	it;	it	simply	remains,	utterly	silent.
You	touch	this	nothingness	when	you	are	deep	in	your	being,	because	that	being
is	 already	 rooted	 in	 this	 nothingness.	 You	 are	 driving	 your	 life,	 moment	 to
moment,	from	that	nothingness.
The	flowers	may	not	understand	from	where	they	have	come.	The	branches	may
not	know	from	where	they	have	come.	The	trunk	of	a	tree	may	not	know	from
where	 it	 has	 come,	 because	 the	 roots	 are	 hidden	 underground.	 The	 roots	 are
hidden	for	security	purposes,	otherwise	you	could	be	harmed	very	badly.
You	 cannot	 take	 even	 your	 very	 intimate	 friend	 into	 your	 nothingness;	 you
cannot	invite	anybody	there	--	no	party!	You	have	to	go	alone.	It	is	such	a	sacred
place.
In	the	old	Jewish	tradition	...	It	is	significant	to	understand,	because	Jews,	their
rabbis,	will	not	be	able	to	give	the	explanation.	Zen	can	give	an	explanation	for
many	things	in	other	religions	also,	because	it	has	gone	to	the	very	root,	 it	has
traveled	the	whole	path.	It	has	not	chosen	one	path,	it	has	accepted	all	paths,	and
still	it	has	gone	beyond	all	paths.	So	it	knows	more	than	anybody	else	and	yet	it
is	absolutely	innocent	because	it	knows	nothing.
In	 the	 great	 temple	 of	 Jerusalem	 there	 used	 to	 be	 a	 festival	 once	 a	 year.	 The
temple	had	an	inner	sanctum,	a	small	room,	and	only	the	chief	rabbi	was	allowed
to	enter	into	it.	He	would	enter,	close	the	doors,	and	in	that	silent,	small	chamber
he	was	allowed	to	whisper	the	word
"God".	 It	 has	 a	beauty	of	 its	own,	why	 it	was	done	 in	 such	a	way.	To	use	 the
word	"God"	as	a	mundane	word	makes	it	also	like	a	thing.	Jews	have	avoided	it
...	you	can	only	whisper	in	silence.	Perhaps	you	don't	even	have	to	whisper;	you
can	simply	feel	the	presence	of	nothingness.
Judaism	is	the	only	religion	which	does	not	write	the	whole	word	"God".	They
leave	the
"o"	 out:	 "G-d".	 The	 "o"	 in	 between	 is	 left	 out,	 they	 don't	 write	 it.	 It	 is
sacrilegious	to	pronounce	the	name	of	God;	something	of	it	is	bound	to	remain
beyond	words.	In	fact,	 the	most	 important	part	--	 the	middle	part	--	 is	missing.
You	have	 touched	only	one	side	or	another	side,	but	you	have	not	 touched	 the
heart	of	 it.	 In	 the	word	also,	you	are	making	 it	clear	 that	unless	you	 touch	 the
heart	of	God	 ...	 and	 the	only	way	 is	 to	 touch	your	own	heart.	You	don't	know
your	own	heart.	Your	heart	has	roots	in	the	universal	heart	from	where	it	gets	its
life.	And	as	the	universal	heart	withdraws	man	dies,	but	the	life	that	was	is	not
finished.	It	may	move	into	a	new	ripple,	into	a	new	flower,	into	a	new	cuckoo	...
millions	are	the	ways.	Or	it	may	remain	silent	in	the	ocean	of	the	cosmos.
Because	it	has	chosen	the	fourth,	Zen's	standpoint	is	the	most	superior,	the	most
delicate,	and	the	most	intimate	one.
AN	OLD	ZEN	MASTER	SAID:
TURN	 YOUR	 HEART	 ROUND	 AND	 ENTER	 THE	 ORIGIN.	 DO	 NOT
SEARCH	FOR
WHAT	 HAS	 SPRUNG	 OUT	 OF	 IT!	 WHEN	 YOU	 HAVE	 GAINED	 THE
ORIGIN,	WHAT
HAS	SPRUNG	OUT	OF	IT	WILL	COME	TO	YOU	OF	ITSELF.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	1	-	How	full,	emptiness!
We	 are	 born	 looking	 outwards.	 Our	 eyes	 open	 outwards,	 our	 hands	 reach
outwards,	all	of	our	senses	are	ready	to	receive	the	outward	vibrations.	But	we
don't	have	any	sense	available	which	gives	us	information	about	our	inner	being.
Meditation	is	the	search	for	that	hidden	eye	that	can	see	your	origin.	It	is	called
the	buddha-eye.	But	a	great	 turning	is	needed.	You	have	to	close	off	 the	world
completely,	 even	 if	 just	 for	 a	 single	 moment,	 and	 give	 a	 turn	 to	 your	 whole
being,	to	look	inside	the	well	from	where	you	are	coming.
And	 don't	 think	 about	 anything	 else,	 because	 this	 experience	 of	 looking	 into
yourself	 will	 explain	 everything	 that	 was	 a	 question	 to	 you.	 Thousands	 of
answers	were	there,	but	no	answer	was	able	to	satisfy	it.
IF	YOU	WANT	TO	KNOW	THE	ORIGIN,	THEN	PENETRATE	YOUR	OWN
ORIGINAL	HEART.	 THIS	HEART	 IS	 THE	 SOURCE	OF	ALL	 BEINGS	 IN
THE	WORLD
AND	 OUTSIDE	 THE	 WORLD.	 WHEN	 THE	 HEART	 STIRS,	 VARIOUS
THINGS	ARISE.
BUT	WHEN	THE	HEART	ITSELF	BECOMES	COMPLETELY	EMPTY,	THE
VARIOUS
THINGS	ALSO	BECOME	EMPTY.	 IF	YOUR	HEART	 IS	DRIVEN	ROUND
NEITHER	BY
GOOD	NOR	BAD,	THEN	ALL	THINGS	ARE	JUST	AS	THEY	ARE.
Zen	 has	 no	 idea	 of	 judgment.	 It	 never	 judges	 that	 somebody	 is	 a	 sinner	 or
somebody	is	a	saint.	These	are	only	waves;	there	is	no	need	to	waste	your	time
on	waves.	 If	 you	 know	 the	 ocean,	 you	 will	 not	 bother	 about	 the	 waves.	 One
wave	turns	in	one	way,	the	other	in	another	way,	but	they	all	belong	to	the	same
ocean	and	they	all	dissolve	finally	into	the	same	ocean.
So	the	only	thing	worth	consideration	is	not	what	is	good	and	what	is	bad,	but
what	is	the	origin	from	where	your	heart	has	come.	It	is	an	existential	approach	-
-	not	theoretical,	not	philosophical.
MASTER	OTSU,	COMMENTING	ON	THIS	 EMPTYING	OF	THE	HEART,
SAID:	 THE	 HEART	 BECOMES	 EMPTY,	 THE	 SITUATION	 QUIET,	 AND
THE	BODY	JUST
AS	IT	IS.
Everything	remains	the	same,	nothing	changes.	This	does	not	mean	that	the	man
who	 has	 approached	 the	 very	 origin	 of	 existence	 becomes	 somebody	 special.
Everything	 remains	 the	 same.	But	on	 the	other	hand,	 everything	 starts	 looking
different.	Now	he	can	see	the	beauty	of	the	flower	that	you	cannot	see.	His	eyes
are	so	fresh	that	he	can	see	the	beauty	of	a	sunset	that	you	cannot	see.	Your	eyes
are	so	full	of	dust,	you	are	hardly	able	to	see.	You	cannot	penetrate	to	the	very
origin	of	a	flower.
But	 a	 man	 who	 knows	 his	 origin	 knows	 the	 origin	 of	 everything.	 He	 never
makes	any	judgment.	This	is	a	great	contribution	to	human	consciousness:	not	to
make	judgments.	That	is	a	very	low	kind	of	morality,	a	very	low	kind	of	religion,
which	goes	on	making	judgments	about	good	and	bad.
In	Zen	 everything	 is,	 as	 it	 is,	 a	manifestation	 of	 the	 cosmic	 soul.	 It	 has	 to	 be
loved	 and	 respected.	 It	 does	 not	matter	what	 the	manifestation	 is	 doing.	What
matters	is	that	the	man	who	is	a	thief	or	a	murderer	is	also	coming	from	the	same
source	as	you	are,	and	he	will	be	going	to	the	same	source	as	you	are.
So	behind	 the	curtain	you	will	 find	great	 saints	 sharing	experiences	with	great
sinners.	On	the	stage	it	is	one	thing;	behind	the	stage	it	is	totally	different.	And
once	you	have	touched	the	origin	of	things,	you	have	gone	behind	the	stage.	On
the	stage	it	is	all	acting.	On	the	stage	it	is	Osho	-	The	Miracle
6
Chapter	1	-	How	full,	emptiness!
simply	 drama.	 Behind	 the	 stage	 it	 is	 pure	 silence,	 nothingness.	 A	 rest,	 a
relaxation	--
everything	has	moved	into	total	tranquility.
WHEN	SOMEONE	SUCCEEDS	IN	REACHING	THIS	POINT,	THE	MIRROR
OF	HIS
HEART	 SHINES	 CLEARLY	 AND	 HIS	 NATURE	 OPENS	 WIDE	 AND
CLEAR.	HE
LEAVES	ERROR	AND	DOES	NOT	ATTACH	HIMSELF	TO	TRUTH.
These	 are	 great	 statements.	 The	 day	 you	 understand	 them	 as	 your	 experience,
you	will	dance	with	joy.
Master	Otsu	is	saying	that	the	moment	a	person	enters	into	the	origin	of	things,
he	leaves	all	dualities	behind:	truth	and	untruth,	love	and	hate.	He	enters	into	the
oneness	of	things.	He	is	neither	worldly	nor	saintly.
That's	why	 it	 is	very	difficult	 to	 find	an	authentic	man	of	meditation.	You	will
find	people	who	are	worldly;	you	can	see	them.	You	can	find	very	easily	people
who	are	other-worldly,	saints.	They	have	renounced	the	world;	that	is	very	easy.
The	 world	 is	 so	 crazy,	 so	 insane,	 that	 one	 wonders	 why	 everybody	 is	 not
renouncing	 it!	 The	 problem	 is	 where	 to	 go?	 If	 everybody	 renounces	 it,
everybody	will	reach	to	another	place,	but	the	same	faces,	the	same	people	...	the
buses	will	start	going	to	Everest,	restaurants	will	have	to	be	opened;	everybody
is	coming	to	the	hills,	renouncing	the	world.
There	is	no	way	to	renounce	the	world.	And	there	is	no	point,	either.	But	that's
what	 all	 your	 religions	 have	 been	 valuing	 the	most:	 renouncing	 the	world.	 So
there	are	saints,	and	those	who	are	still	attached	to	things	are	sinners.	But	for	a
man	of	cosmic	consciousness	--
and	that's	what	the	ultimate	of	meditation	is	--	all	waves	are	just	drama.
It	is	a	beautiful	drama.	You	cannot	take	away	the	sinners;	otherwise	it	will	lose
all	salt.
The	 saints	 and	 the	 sinners	 both	 are	 needed	 to	make	 the	drama.	Love	 and	hate
both	are	needed.
If	 everything	 is	 goody-goody	 ...	 finished!	All	 taste	 is	 lost.	 If	 everybody	 looks
alike	--	very	saintly,	very	pious	--	the	world	will	become	a	boredom.	It	is	good
that	a	 few	people	are	cheats,	a	 few	people	are	cutting	your	pockets.	 If	nobody
cuts	the	pockets,	what	is	the	point	of	having	pockets?	To	make	the	drama	richer
...
Just	the	other	day,	Anando	brought	me	news:	A	man	has	reported	to	the	police
station	that	his	wife	was	missing.	The	police	officer	asked,	"When	did	you	find
that	she	was	missing?"
He	said,	"I	don't	remember.	It	may	be	a	few	weeks,	or	maybe	a	few	months.	She
is	certainly	missing,	but	there	is	no	hurry	to	find	her."
A	great	man	of	insight.
I	have	heard	another	version:
A	man	came	running	 into	a	post	office,	 tears	coming	down,	and	he	said	 to	 the
postmaster,
"My	 wife	 is	 missing	 --	 find	 her	 immediately!"	 He	 would	 not	 even	 give	 the
postmaster	a	chance	to	say	anything.	He	was	so	much	in	misery	and	suffering,
and	tears	rolling	down,	that	 the	postmaster	said	finally,	"Listen,	 this	 is	 the	post
office."
He	said,	"I	know."
The	postmaster	said,	"The	police	station	is	just	opposite,	on	the	other	side	of	the
road."
The	man	said,	"I	know."

The	postmaster	said,	"If	you	know,	then	why	are	you	bothering	me?	For	half	an
hour	crying	and	weeping	...	Just	go	to	the	police	station."
The	man	said,	"Once	before	it	also	happened,	and	I	went	to	the	police	station	and
those	 idiots	 brought	 my	 wife	 back!	 Now	 I'm	 not	 going.	 You	 have	 to	 write	 it
down,	just	for	my	consolation,	that	at	least	I	reported	it.	To	whom	I	reported	it
does	not	matter."
The	postmaster	said,	"Okay,	I	can	take	the	report,	but	that	will	not	help."
The	man	 said,	 "That's	what	 I	want,	 that	 it	 should	 not	 help.	You	 just	write	 the
report.	Those	police	officers	are	such	idiots.	I	told	them	that	there	was	no	hurry,
but	they	brought	my	wife	within	six	hours	and	again	the	old	drama	started."
But	 it	 is	 a	 beautiful	 world	where	wives	 run	 away,	 where	 husbands	 run	 away,
where	people	forget	to	come	back	home,	enter	into	another	home	and	are	gone.
Rather	 than	making	 it	 a	miserable	 place,	 Zen	 gives	 it	 color.	And	 that	 needs	 a
very	 great	 heart,	 to	 accept	 that	 the	 drama	 needs	many	 kinds	 of	 people,	many
kinds	 of	 acts,	 many	 tragedies,	 many	 comedies.	 There	 is	 no	 need	 to	 make
judgments.
SUCH	DETACHMENT	FROM	EVERYTHING	 IS	WHAT	MASTER	RINZAI
CALLED
"THE	COMPLETE	TAKING	AWAY	OF	BOTH,	OF	MAN	AND	SITUATION."
What	is	the	difference	between	you	and	the	other	person?	--	a	certain	situation.
You	were	born	into	a	different	family;	that	is	a	situation.	You	were	educated	in	a
different	school;	that	is	a	situation.	What	is	different	between	man	and	man,	man
and	woman?	--	just	a	situation.
Rinzai	 is	 saying,	 THE	 COMPLETE	 TAKING	 AWAY	 OF	 BOTH,	 OF	 MAN
AND
SITUATION.	 HERE	 IS	 EXPERIENCED	ABSOLUTE	NOT-NESS.	 He	 is	 not
using	the	word
'nothingness'	 because	 you	 misunderstand	 it.	 To	 emphasize	 that	 it	 is	 not
nothingness,	he	says	it	is	simply	not-ness,	it	is	pure	emptiness.
...	 SINCE	 SELF	 AND	 OBJECT	 ALLOW	 THEMSELVES	 TO	 COME	 TO
NOTHING.
Everything	comes	 to	relax	 into	nothing,	and	then	arises,	 rejuvenated,	back	 into
some	manifestation.	The	way	Zen	looks	at	the	world,	it	does	not	make	anybody
feel	guilty;	neither	does	it	make	anybody	feel	superior.	The	source	is	the	same,
the	 game	 is	 the	 same.	Of	 course,	 different	 players	 have	 to	 play	 from	different
sides.
GENUINE	 ZEN	 EXPERIENCE	 CONSISTS	 EXCLUSIVELY	 IN	 THIS
"TAKING
AWAY	 OF	 MAN	 AND	 OBJECT."	 THIS	 COMPLETE	 NOT-NESS	 IS	 THE
ORIGINAL
PLACE	 FROM	WHICH	 ALL	 THINKING	 AND	 KNOWING	 SPRING.	 BUT
EVEN	IF	ONE
IS	 PERMITTED	 TO	 SPEAK	 OF	 A	 "PLACE"	 AT	 ALL,	 SUCH
TERMINOLOGY	IS	ONLY
PROVISIONAL.
You	cannot	call	it	even	a	place;	it	is	only	space.
EVEN	IF	ONE	WANTED	TO	CHARACTERIZE	IT	AS	UNBORN-NESS,	OR
AS
NIRVANA,	OR	AS	TRUTH,	ONE	COULD	NEVER	HIT	IT.
One	has	just	touched	on	it.	No	word	can	reach	to	the	very	heart	of	existence.
IT	LIES	BEYOND	ALL	TERMINOLOGY	AND	EXPRESSION;	THINKING
CANNOT
REACH	THAT	FAR.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	1	-	How	full,	emptiness!
But	 silence	 can	 divulge	 as	much	 depth	 as	 you	 have	 courage	 for.	What	words
cannot	manage	to	express,	your	silence	can	express,	your	laughter	can	express,
because	laughter	is	coming	from	the	depth	of	your	heart.	It	is	just	like	a	flower.
Words	 are	 first	 put	 into	 you	 just	 the	 way	 computers	 are	 fed	 full	 of	 all	 the
information	that	they	have.	Then	you	can	ask	them	and	they	will	repeat	it.	That
does	not	make	 them	very	great	 learned	scholars.	But	 that	 is	what	your	 learned
scholars	are.	They	have	not	a	single	word	of	their	own	to	say.
The	cosmic	origin	of	things	is	beyond	our	intellect,	our	mind,	our	words.	But	in
deep	silence	we	reach	it.	We	feel	the	dance	of	it,	we	hear	the	music	of	it,	we	feel
the	unknown	fragrance	of	it.
There	is	a	Zen	saying:
TEN	YEARS	OF	DREAMS	IN	THE	FOREST!
NOW	ON	THE	LAKE'S	EDGE	LAUGHING,
LAUGHING	A	NEW	LAUGH.
TEN	YEARS	OF	DREAMS	IN	THE	FOREST!	--	because	a	meditator	does	not
just	one	day	become	a	meditator;	dreams	follow,	for	years.	Even	if	you	go	into
the	 deepest	 forest,	 those	 dreams	 haunt	 you.	 But	 slowly	 slowly	 those	 dreams
settle	down	because	there	is	no	point.	You	are	no	more	interested	in	them;	on	the
contrary	you	simply	sit	there	watching.
This	 watchfulness	 makes	 you	 so	 silent	 that	 when	 sitting	 by	 the	 lake's	 edge,
laughing	...
laughing	about	what?	Laughing	about	the	whole	world;	 that	you	have	it	within
you	 and	 still	 you	 are	 searching	 for	 it.	 LAUGHING	 A	 NEW	 LAUGH.	 A
meditator	laughs	a	new	laugh.	Its	freshness	comes	from	his	depths.
Another	Zen	saying:
FOR	TEN	YEARS	I	COULD	NOT	RETURN;
NOW	I	HAVE	FORGOTTEN	THE	ROAD
BY	WHICH	I	CAME.
He	is	saying	that	he	has	reached	his	origins.	It	took	ten	years	to	find	it,	and	now
he	 has	 forgotten	 the	 road,	 how	 to	 come	 back	 --	 THE	 ROAD	 BY	WHICH	 I
CAME.
Please,	don't	you	do	that!	Every	day	I	take	you	to	the	very	origin	of	things,	but	I
don't	leave	you	there	long	enough.	I	keep	Nivedano	alert.	Somebody	may	forget
the	way	back;	then	I	will	be	responsible.	But	Nivedano	has	a	good	drum,	and	he
is	 finding	 some	 other,	 better	 instruments.	 So	 in	 spite	 of	 yourself,	 you	 are
suddenly	awake.	Before	you	know	it,	you	have	come	back.
There	is	not	much	distance	between	you	as	you	are	and	as	your	original	being	is.
The	 difference	 is	 so	 slight	 --	 just	 a	 drum	 beat,	 a	 hit	 on	 your	 head	 by	Master
Niskriya,	anything	can	bring	you	back.

Chapter	1	-	How	full,	emptiness!
This	Zen	master	who	remained	for	ten	years	and	could	not	come	back	must	have
been	searching	alone,	without	a	master.	Otherwise	the	master	gives	you	a	certain
rope;	he	does	not	allow	you	to	go	beyond	that.	He	gives	you	a	taste	of	your	being
--	 that	 is	 enough	 --	 and	 a	 remembrance	 of	 it.	 He	 takes	 you	 through	 the	 rose
garden	and	the	fragrance	of	 the	roses	hangs	around	your	clothes.	That	much	is
enough.	You	 know	who	 you	 are	 and	 your	 actions	 express	 your	 sincerity,	 your
every	gesture	becomes	a	buddha	gesture.	Just	two	minutes	are	enough	to	reach
the	origin	of	your	being.
I	go	on	watching:	when	I	say	die,	 I	have	 to	watch	whether	somebody	 is	 really
dying.
Otherwise	I	will	be	proved	a	criminal,	that	I	ordered	him	to	die	and	he	died.	So	I
have	to	keep	watch.	And	the	only	way	is,	I	have	to	feel	your	heart	throbbing	--
ten	 thousand	hearts	 throbbing.	And	my	arithmetic	 is	 not	good,	but	 somehow	 I
manage.	At	least	up	to	now	I	have	managed.	One	never	knows	about	tomorrow,
or	even	tonight.
Sardar	 Gurudayal	 Singh	 is	 laughing,	 and	 he	 is	 one	 of	 the	 fellows	 who	 may
become	 lost	 and	not	 come	back.	He	may	not	 care	 about	Nivedano's	 drum.	He
may	listen,	but	may	not	care.
But	I	have	other	ways	also.
(SARDAR	LAUGHS	HEARTILY.)
Do	you	want	to	see	my	other	ways?
(THE	MASTER	BEGINS	TO	MAKE	TICKLING	GESTURES	TOWARDS
AVIRBHAVA,	 AS	 HE	 DID	 THE	 PREVIOUS	 EVENING,	 AND	WAVES	 OF
LAUGHTER
RISE	 AND	 FALL	 AS	 HE	 "TICKLES"	 AGAIN	 AND	 AGAIN.)	 This	 way	 is
purely	 imported	 --	 Hollywood,	 California.	 A	 real	 buddha!	 And	 I	 have	 my
substitutes	...
(HE	TURNS	TO	ANANDO	AND	PROVOKES	MORE	LAUGHTER.)
Nobody	 can	 die	 here.	 Even	 if	 you	 have	 died,	 you	will	 have	 to	 laugh	 at	 least.
That's	why	I	am	at	ease	in	ordering	you	to	die.	Otherwise	who	orders	anybody	to
die	--	and	die	completely	and	totally?	Because	I	know	that	I	have	ways	to	wake
you	up	even	if	you	are	dead.	Every	night	I	have	to	do	it.	A	few	people	really	die.
And	another	Zen	master:
HE	SEES	ONLY	THE	WINDING
OF	THE	STREAM
AND	THE	TWISTING	OF	THE	PATH.
HE	DOES	NOT	KNOW	THAT	ALREADY
HE	IS	IN	THE	LAND	OF	THE	IMMORTALS.

A	 tremendously	significant	 statement.	You	see	only	misery	and	suffering	 --	all
non-essentials.	 You	 don't	 see	 that	 on	 this	 very	 earth,	 immortal	 buddhas	 have
moved,	 lived,	 loved.	 You	 don't	 see	 the	 heights	 that	 human	 consciousness	 has
reached	many,	many	times.
You	remain	confined	to	very	small	things.
At	 least	 every	 evening	with	me,	 you	 have	 to	 reach	 the	 heights.	And	 don't	 get
lost;	 come	 back	 down	 to	 the	 marketplace.	 My	 whole	 message	 is:	 Touch	 the
heights	of	consciousness	and	bring	those	heights	to	the	marketplace.
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
YOU	 SEEM	 TO	 EMBODY	 THE	 MIRACLE	 OF	 ZEN	 --	 HOW	 FULL
EMPTINESS	CAN
BE!
Maneesha,	there	is	no	end	to	the	fullness	of	emptiness.	Because	if	there	were	a
limit,	 then	the	emptiness	would	not	be	really	empty;	it	would	have	boundaries.
Total	emptiness	means	the	whole	cosmos,	unlimited,	in	your	hands.	And	if,	out
of	meditation,	you	cannot	bring	a	new	juice,	a	fresh	fragrance,	a	new	life	and	a
new	laughter,	your	meditation	has	not	been	authentic.
You	played	the	game	but	not	totally.
Otherwise	...	every	night,	ten	thousand	people	are	becoming	buddhas.	When	the
same	 buddhas	 come	 again	 they	 have	 forgotten	 what	 has	 happened	 last	 night.
They	wake	up	and	start	looking	for	their	rented	bicycles.	This	is	very	strange	--
buddhas	never	have	used	rented	bicycles.	And	so	quickly!
Just	take	time,	don't	be	in	such	a	hurry.
But	 I	 am	 introducing	 in	 the	 world	 a	 new	 kind	 of	 buddha	 who	 can	 have	 a
girlfriend,	and	can	change	his	girlfriend	as	many	times	as	he	wants,	because	we
don't	take	this	world	seriously.
So	 I	 see	my	buddhas	moving	with	 new	girlfriends	 every	 day.	Nobody	 exactly
knows	...
(THE	 MASTER	 BEGINS	 TO	 "TICKLE"	 AVIRBHAVA	 AGAIN,	 AND	 WE
LAUGH
ALONG	WITH	HIM.)
Maneesha,	this	is	the	miracle	you	are	talking	about!	Another	miracle	is	...
(HE	TURNS	TO	"TICKLE"	ANANDO.)
I	have	got	only	two	miracles.	But	I	think	two	are	enough	to	make	ten	thousand
buddhas	 laugh.	 And	 they	 do	 nothing.	 They	 sit	 so	 buddha-like.	 But	 still	 they
trigger	you.
And	I	have	got,	 just	behind	Maneesha,	Stonehead.	Now	he	has	cut	all	his	hair,
removed	his	beard,	and	left	a	small	Chinese	moustache.	You	all	have	to	see	him
in	his	whole	glory.
Germany	has	never	seen	a	Zen	master	...
Do	you	want	to	see	him	in	his	full	glory?

It	is	ten	o'clock	at	night	when	Og	and	Beep-o,	two	Martian	pilots,	land	on	earth
in	 the	middle	of	a	city.	Og	is	sent	out	 to	make	contact	with	whatever	he	finds,
while	Beep-o	watches	him	on	a	TV	screen.
The	first	thing	Og	runs	into	is	big	Olga	Kowalski	taking	her	dog	for	its	nightly
walk.	The	dog	is	sniffing	enthusiastically	at	a	lamppost	as	Og	approaches	them.
Five	minutes	later,	a	battered	Og	returns	to	his	flying	saucer.	"What	happened	to
you	out	there?"	cries	Beep-o.
"Well,"	says	Og,	"there	was	a	 little	hairy	creature	on	a	 rope	 that	kept	smelling
me,	and	then	it	watered	my	feet	..."
"Yes,"	interrupts	Beep-o.	"But	what	about	that	big,	ugly	beast	on	the	other	end	of
the	rope?"
"Oh,	that!"	exclaims	Og.	"Be	careful	of	that	one.	While	the	little	hairy	beast	was
washing	my	feet,	that	big	one	walked	up	to	me,	stuck	a	silver	coin	in	my	mouth,
then	beat	on	my	face	and	screamed,	'Shit!	There	is	never	any	fucking	Coca-Cola
in	these	machines!'"
Paddy	decides	to	have	his	old	Ford	car	completely	computerized	and	automated
at	O'Grady's	Garage.
After	the	job	is	done,	he	drives	over	to	Kowalski's	house.	An	hour	and	ten	beers
later,	 Paddy	 shouts,	 "Hey,	 Kowalski!	 Come	 and	 listen	 to	 my	 new	 automatic
compact	disc	player!"
Kowalski	grabs	his	can	of	beer,	staggers	across	the	yard	and	gets	into	the	car.
"How	about	some	Irish	music?"	slobbers	Paddy,	selecting	a	tiny	silver	disc	and
pushing	several	buttons	on	the	dashboard.
Five	minutes	later	the	speeding	Ford	car	rounds	a	corner	on	two	wheels,	knocks
down	a	policeman	and	four	pedestrians,	overturns	a	fruit-cart,	slices	a	telephone
pole	 in	 half,	 flattens	 one	 hundred	 yards	 of	 bushes,	 rolls	 over	 three	 times,	 and
flies	through	the	open	door	of	the	pub
--	finally	coming	to	rest	against	the	shattered	bar.

A	dazed	Paddy	opens	the	crumpled	door	of	the	back	seat	and	staggers	out.	Then
an	equally	dazed	Kowalski	rubs	his	eyes	and	peers	at	Paddy	through	the	dust.
"Jeezus	Christ!"	Kowalski	cries.	"Can	you	get	all	that	on	a	tiny	compact	disc?"
Spudski,	the	Polack	farmer,	is	hiring	someone	to	help	him	run	his	farm.
Clodski	applies	for	the	job	and	goes	for	an	interview.
"Now	show	me,"	says	Farmer	Spudski,	"how	you	blow	your	nose."
Clodski	 is	puzzled,	but	obligingly	clears	his	nostrils,	one	at	a	 time	into	 the	air,
making	a	disgusting	noise.
"Okay,"	says	Spudski,	"you	are	hired."
"You	mean,"	asks	Clodski,	"that's	all	you	want	to	know	about	me?	Why?"
"Well,	 you	 see,"	 explains	 the	 farmer,	 "the	 last	 guy	 that	 worked	 here	 had	 a

3	August	1988	pm	in	Gautam	the	Buddha	Auditorium
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
DOGEN	WROTE:
NOW,	WHEN	WE	 SEE	 THE	 FOLLOWERS	 OF	 AN	 ENLIGHTENED	 ZEN
MASTER,	 WE	 REALIZE	 THAT	 THEY	 HAVE	 MANY	 DIFFICULTIES	 IN
HEARING	HIS	TRUE
TEACHINGS.	TRUE	ASPIRANTS	OF	BUDDHISM	AMOUNT	TO	TWENTY
OR	THIRTY
--	NAY,	TO	ONE	HUNDRED	OR	TO	ONE	THOUSAND.	IN	THIS	CASE,	IF
A	MASTER
TRIES	TO	LEAD	EVERY	ONE	OF	THEM,	HE	WILL	FIND	THE	DAYS	AND
NIGHTS
TOO	 SHORT.	 FURTHER,	 THEY	 HAVE	 NO	 EAR	 FOR	 HIS	 TEACHINGS,
HOWEVER
HARD	HE	MAY	TRY	TO	LEAD	THEM.	BUT	WHEN	THEY	GIVE	EAR	TO
HIM,	HIS
SERMON	IS	ALREADY	FINISHED.
WHEN	 AN	 OLD	 ZEN	 MASTER	 LAUGHS	 LOUDLY,	 CLAPPING	 HIS
HANDS,	 BEGINNERS	 AND	 LATER-DAY	 TRAINEES	 IN	 BUDDHISM
SEEM	TO	HAVE
DIFFICULTY	 EVEN	 IN	 HAVING	 A	 CHANCE	 TO	 FIND	 THEMSELVES
AMONG	THE
ATTENDANTS.	 SOME	 OF	 THEM	 REALIZE	 THE	 INNERMOST	 DEPTHS
OF	THE
MASTER,	 AND	 OTHERS,	 NOT.	 SOME	 HEAR	 THE	 CORE	 OF	 THE
MASTER'S
ENLIGHTENMENT,	AND	OTHERS,	NOT.
TIME	 FLIES	 FASTER	 THAN	 AN	 ARROW;	 LIFE	 IS	 MORE	 TRANSIENT
THAN	 A	 DEWDROP.	 SOME	 MAY	 HAVE	 THE	 MASTER,	 BUT	 REGRET
THAT	THEY	CANNOT
HEAR	HIS	TEACHINGS.	SOME	WISH	TO	LISTEN	TO	HIS	TEACHINGS,
BUT	REGRET
THAT	THEY	CANNOT	SEE	THE	MASTER	HIMSELF.
ON	ANOTHER	OCCASION,	DOGEN	SAID:
MY	OWN	MASTER	NEVER	EASILY	PERMITTED	NEW	MONKS	TO	STAY
IN	HIS
TEMPLE,	USUALLY	SAYING,	"THOSE,	WHO,	LACKING	IN	THE	BODHI-
MIND,	BEHAVE	THEMSELVES	MERELY	FROM	FORCE	OF	HABIT	MUST
NOT	STAY
HERE."	HAVING	TURNED	THEM	OUT,	HE	SAID,	"THEY	ARE	LACKING
IN	THE
BODHI-SEEKING	 MIND.	 WHAT	 ARE	 THEY	 GOING	 TO	 DO?	 SUCH
FELLOWS	ONLY
DISTURB	OTHERS.	THEY	ARE	NOT	WORTHY	OF	BEING	ALLOWED	TO
STAY
HERE."
DOGEN	 CONTINUED:	 SEEING	 AND	 PERSONALLY	 HEARING	 THIS
FACT,	I	SAID
TO	MYSELF:	"LIVING	AS	THEY	ARE,	IN	THIS	COUNTRY,	WHAT	SIN	OR
CRIME	IN
THEIR	PREVIOUS	EXISTENCE,	PREVENTS	THEM	FROM	LIVING	WITH
MY
MASTER?	UNDER	WHAT	A	LUCKY	STAR	I	WAS	BORN	THAT,	COMING
FROM	 A	 FAR-DISTANT	 FOREIGN	 COUNTRY,	 I	 AM	 PERMITTED	 TO
STAY	HERE	TO
WORSHIP	 HIS	 VENERABLE	 BODY	 AND	 LISTEN	 TO	 HIS	 SERMON!
FOOLISH	 AS	 I	 AM,	 I	 HAVE	 BEEN	 ABLE	 TO	 FORM	 A	 GOOD	 AND
FRUITFUL	CONNECTION	WITH
HIM.	"
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	2	-	Dissolved,	just	like	ice
Maneesha,	Dogen	is	dealing	with	one	of	the	most	important	aspects	of	Zen.	His
statement	is	not	as	exact	as	it	could	be,	but	anyway	he	comes	very	approximately
near	to	the	truth.
He	does	not	mention,	and	perhaps	no	Zen	master	has	ever	mentioned,	that	there
are	 three	 potentialities.	 When	 a	 seeker	 comes	 to	 a	 master	 he	 may	 be	 only	 a
student,	most	of	them	are.
They	 are	 in	 search	 of	 more	 knowledge	 because	 knowledge	 brings	 power,
knowledge	brings	respectability,	knowledge	brings	honor	and	dignity.	But	these
are	not	the	true	seekers.
The	second	category	that	comes	to	the	master	is	the	disciple.	Zen	masters	have
reached	 very	 high	 as	 far	 as	 human	 consciousness	 is	 concerned.	But	 they	 have
stopped	at	the	second	category	of	seekers,	the	disciple	and	the	master.
There	is	another	category	which	Zen	is	not	aware	of,	because	it	was	not	needed.
To	be	a	disciple	was	enough	...	to	meditate,	to	watch	the	master,	and	to	create	a
connection	 of	 consciousnesses.	 It	 has	 worked	well	 for	 Zen	 but	 I	 can	 see	 that
something	is	missing,	and	that	is	the	devotee.
The	third	category	of	seekers	did	not	happen	in	Zen.	The	masters	have	reached
to	the	highest	peak,	but	 the	disciple	cannot	reach	to	 the	highest	peak	unless	he
becomes	a	devotee.
And	the	difference	is	great.	The	disciple	is	satisfied	if	he	is	connected	with	the
master	--
watches	 his	 movements,	 listens	 to	 his	 words,	 listens	 to	 his	 silences.	 Slowly
slowly	 he	 starts	 growing	 an	 individuality	 of	 his	 own.	 He	 may	 jump	 from
disciplehood	into	mastership.
Zen	knows	disciples	and	masters.	But	a	more	ancient	 tradition	 in	 India,	which
has	 almost	 disappeared,	 makes	 it	 clear	 that	 unless	 a	 disciple	 first	 becomes	 a
devotee	there	is	no	way	of	becoming	a	master.
And	what	 is	 the	difference	between	 the	disciple	and	 the	devotee?	The	disciple
seeks	 connection,	 the	 devotee	 seeks	 dissolvement;	 the	 disciple	 seeks
individuality,	 the	devotee	seeks	the	ocean.	Personality	is	borrowed,	it	has	to	be
dropped;	individuality	is	your	own,	but	if	you	can	manage	to	drop	it	also	then	the
whole	ocean	is	yours.	Otherwise,	a	dewdrop	is	beautiful	in	the	sunlight	or	in	the
moonlight,	but	the	roaring	reality	of	the	ocean	and	the	eternity	of	the	ocean	are
missing.	The	dewdrop	has	no	song	 to	 sing;	 the	ocean	has	millions	of	 songs	 to
sing	and	millions	remain	unsung.
Although	the	dewdrop	can	reflect	the	moon	as	much	as	the	ocean,	the	depth	of
the	reflection	cannot	be	more	than	the	circular	dimension	of	the	dewdrop.	In	the
ocean	the	same	moon	penetrates	to	the	very	depths,	miles	deep.
Being	a	devotee	means	dropping	even	 individuality,	 dropping	even	 the	 feeling
that,	"I	am"
...	 just	 merging	 with	 the	 universe.	 It	 is	 the	 ultimate	 quantum	 leap.	 From
personality	 to	 individuality	 is	 a	 very	 small	 jump,	 available	 to	many,	 but	 from
individuality	to	no-individuality	is	a	very	rare	occurrence.	And	that's	what	makes
a	disciple	a	devotee.
Because	 Zen	 tradition	 knows	 nothing	 about	 the	 devotee,	 there	 is	 something
missing	in	it.	It	brings	the	individual	to	realize	the	truth,	it	brings	the	individual
back	 home;	 but	 the	 separation	 of	 the	 individual	 from	 the	 master	 and	 the
separation	 of	 the	 individual	 from	 existence	 still	 remain	 in	 a	 very	 subtle	 form.
The	disciple	still	is.	He	has	not	forgotten	himself	completely,	he	has	not	dropped
even	his	being.
A	devotee	is	a	miracle.	He	simply	disappears	into	the	whole,	leaving	behind	not
even	a	trace.

Gautam	Buddha	 is	 reported	 to	have	said	 that	 the	authentic	seeker	 is	 just	 like	a
bird	flying	in	the	sky,	leaving	no	footmarks	behind.	When	the	bird	becomes	one
with	the	sky	...	not	only	in	tune,	because	in	tune	you	still	remain	separate.	The
disciple	is	in	tune	with	the	master	but	they	are	two	different	instruments,	meeting
deeply	with	each	other,	but	the	separation	line	is	still	there.	The	devotee	simply
disappears,	only	the	master	remains.	The	master	himself	becomes	just	a	window
for	him	to	jump	into	the	beyond.
Because	 the	 devotee	 is	 not	 at	 all	 a	 part	 of	 the	 Zen	 tradition	 ...	 and	 there	 are
reasons	why	the	word	has	not	appeared.	The	reasons	are	that	devotees	--	the	very
word	'devotee'	has	become	contaminated	with	the	idea	of	God,	with	worship.	To
devote	yourself,	to	dedicate	yourself,	to	surrender	yourself	...	but	all	these	words
are	not	the	essence	of	the	word	'devotee'.	Because	of	these	misconceptions	about
the	devotee,	Zen	has	not	used	 the	word	at	all	 --	because	 there	 is	no	God	 to	be
devoted	to	and	there	is	no	worship	to	be	done;	you	have	to	be	just	yourself.
My	 own	 experience	 is	 that	 just	 to	 be	 yourself	 is	 great,	 but	 not	 great	 enough.
There	is	one	step	more	--	not	to	be.	Let	the	pine	trees	stand	in	their	beauty	under
the	 full	moon,	 let	 the	 birds	 sing,	 let	 the	 sun	 rise	 and	 set,	 but	 you	will	 not	 be
found	 anywhere.	You	 are	 no	more,	 existence	 is.	 This	 ultimate	 step	makes	 the
disciple	a	devotee	...	no	worship,	no	question	of	any	God.	And	according	to	me,
unless	one	is	a	devotee,	not	in	tune	with	the	universe	but	one	with	the	universe,
he	cannot	be	a	master.
Hence	the	master	is	one	of	the	most	miraculous	phenomena.	He	is	and	he	is	not.
He	 is	 to	 you,	 from	 the	 outside;	 he	 is	 not	 at	 all	 from	 the	 inside.	 Inside	 is	 pure
space.	 This	 you	 have	 to	 remember	 before	 I	 talk	 about	 Dogen,	 because	 he	 is
talking	about	the	difficulties	of	the	disciple.
Dogen	wrote:
NOW,	WHEN	WE	 SEE	 THE	 FOLLOWERS	 OF	 AN	 ENLIGHTENED	 ZEN
MASTER	...
In	fact	a	Zen	master	has	no	followers.	That	is	the	beauty	of	Zen:	he	has	lovers,
he	 has	 people	 as	 fellow	 travelers,	 but	 not	 followers.	 Others	 have	 followers	 --
following	means	imitating,	following	means	preparing	oneself	step	by	step	in	a
discipline.	 It	 is	more	or	 less	creating	yourself	 in	 the	 image	of	your	master,	but
that	again	is	hypocrisy.
I	will	not	say,	FOLLOWERS	OF	AN	ENLIGHTENED	ZEN	MASTER.	If	there
are	 followers	 then	 the	 master	 is	 not	 enlightened.	 If	 the	 master	 is	 enlightened
there	are	only	lovers,	fellow	travelers.	The	question	of	following	does	not	arise.
I	make	this	statement	with	absolute	authority,	that	Dogen	has	missed	the	point.
He	 says:	 ...	 WE	 REALIZE	 THAT	 THEY	 HAVE	MANY	 DIFFICULTIES	 IN
HEARING
HIS	TRUE	TEACHINGS.	TRUE	ASPIRANTS	OF	BUDDHISM	AMOUNT	TO
TWENTY
OR	 THIRTY	 --	 NAY,	 TO	 ONE	 HUNDRED	 OR	 TO	 ONE	 THOUSAND.	 IN
THIS	CASE,	IF
A	MASTER	TRIES	TO	LEAD	EVERY	ONE	OF	THEM,	HE	WILL	FIND	THE
DAYS	AND
NIGHTS	 TOO	 SHORT.	 FURTHER,	 THEY	 HAVE	 NO	 EAR	 FOR	 HIS
TEACHINGS,	HOWEVER	HARD	HE	MAY	TRY	TO	LEAD	THEM.
Dogen	 does	 not	 understand	 the	working	 of	 a	master.	 Perhaps	 these	 statements
were	 made	 by	 him	 before	 he	 himself	 became	 a	 master.	 There	 is	 a	 difficulty,
because	 in	 those	 days	 there	 was	 no	 printing,	 no	 writing,	 just	 disciples	 taking
notes.	So	 it	 is	very	difficult	 to	know	whether	 it	 is	Dogen's	own	mistake	or	 the
mistake	of	the	person	who	was	taking	the	notes.
Osho	-	The	Miracle
18
Chapter	2	-	Dissolved,	just	like	ice
But	anyway	we	don't	know	who	took	the	notes.	One	thing	is	certain,	that	Dogen
must	have	said	something	to	create	the	fault.
First,	TRUE	ASPIRANTS	OF	BUDDHISM.	He	is	still	talking	in	terms	of	'isms'
and	Zen	 is	 not	 an	 'ism'.	 Zen	 is	 freedom	 from	 all	 'isms'	 --	Buddhism	 included.
And	 aspirants	 are	 for	 the	 truth,	 not	 for	 Buddhism,	 not	 for	 Hinduism,	 not	 for
Christianity.	 These	 are	 not	 aspirants,	 these	 are	 conditioned	 people	 who	 are
following	their	conditioning.	They	may	find	a	certain	solace,	a	consolation,	but
they	will	never	find	the	truth,	because	truth	is	not	part	of	any	theology.
Dogen's	 statements	 are	 very	 amateurish.	 TRUE	ASPIRANTS	 is	 enough;	 don't
say	OF
BUDDHISM.	Why	should	anybody	be	an	aspirant	of	Buddhism?	Everybody	is	a
buddha	himself.	So	it	is	better	to	say:	"Seekers,	aspirants,	searchers	of	one's	own
being."	Why	bring	theologies	in?	That	is	not	the	Zen	way.
And	he	does	not	know	that	a	master	can	have	thousands	of	disciples.	He	may	not
know	even	their	names,	he	may	not	have	even	met	them	--	it	does	not	matter.	He
works	in	a	totally	different	way	than	things	are	done	in	the	ordinary	world.	He
simply	creates	an	atmosphere,	he	does	not	work	with	"A"	and	"B"	and	"C".
Then	 naturally,	 according	 to	Dogen,	 a	man's	 life	 is	 very	 short;	 if	 he	 becomes
enlightened	--
as	Gautam	Buddha	became	enlightened	--	at	 the	age	of	forty	 ...	He	 lived	up	 to
eighty-two.	In	forty-two	years,	if	he	had	worked	day	and	night	without	sleeping,
without	eating	...	even	then,	how	many	people	would	he	have	been	able	to	bring
to	the	consciousness	that	he	had	achieved?
And	 that	 is	 a	 very	 foolish	way,	 there	 is	 no	 need.	The	 very	mastery,	 the	 art	 of
being	 a	master	 is	 to	 create	 an	 atmosphere	 in	which	 things	 start	 happening	 on
their	own.	What	are	we	doing	here?	I	don't	know	many	of	you,	I	don't	know	your
names,	I	don't	meet	you	personally.	I	simply	create	an	atmosphere	in	which	you
can	drown,	in	which	you	can	drink	the	very	juice	of	life.	There	is	no	need	for	me
to	 work	 on	 individuals	 --	 that	 is	 a	 very	 poor	 and	 primitive	 way.	 I	 work	 by
creating	an	atmosphere,	an	energy	field,	and	every	day	that	energy	field	becomes
more	and	more	powerful.	Every	one	of	you	contributes	to	it.	You	are	not	just	on
the	side	of	taking;	you	are	also	a	giver.
Here	your	presence,	your	consciousness,	certainly	creates	a	chain	reaction.	Just
the	man	sitting	by	your	side	...	you	may	not	know	him	at	all,	but	in	your	silence
you	meet	with	him.
When	 everybody	 becomes	 silent	 there	 is	 simply	 a	 lake	 of	 buddhahood	 --	 one
consciousness,	one	existence,	one	dance.	You	are	not	in	tune	with	existence,	you
are	it.
So,	for	his	first	mistake,	he	thinks	that	life	is	too	short	and	a	master	cannot	work
on	 many	 people.	 That	 is	 absolutely	 wrong.	 A	 single	 master	 can	 work	 on	 the
whole	world.	And	he	need	not	go	out	of	his	room;	he	can	radiate	enough	energy,
invisible	rays,	to	surround	the	whole	globe.
Many	times	it	has	been	reported	to	me	that	some	sannyasin	has	come	from	New
Zealand	or	some	sannyasin	has	come	even	from	the	Soviet	Union,	for	the	reason
that	he	simply	saw	my	picture.	A	friend	had	my	picture,	and	seeing	the	picture	a
tremendous	longing	arose	in	him	somehow	to	reach	me	--	 irrational,	but	 life	 is
irrational.
Somebody	has	read	a	few	words	in	a	book	and	those	words	become	a	magnetic
force	 so	 that	 he	 has	 to	 come	 here.	 Somebody	 has	 heard	 how	 I	 have	 been
condemned,	criticized,	and	 thinks,	"If	 so	many	people	and	so	many	magazines
and	so	many	politicians	are	against	this	man,	there	must	be	something	to	him."

Nobody	 is	 opposed	 on	 such	 a	 vast	 scale.	 I	 cannot	 enter	 twenty-one	 countries,
their	parliaments	have	passed	laws.
Just	today	I	received	a	beautiful	note	from	Vimal,	who	has	gone	to	England.	He
had	 taken	his	girlfriend,	who	 is	 an	 Indian,	 to	 the	British	High	Commissioner's
office	 in	 Bombay.	 They	 would	 not	 give	 a	 visa	 to	 the	 Indian	 woman.	 They
interrogated	her	for	hours	and	finally	refused.
But	Vimal	is	not	a	person	who	will	accept	any	refusal	so	easily.	He	asked	to	see
the	highest	authority.	He	did	not	want	to	deal	with	an	assistant	commissioner;	he
wanted	to	see	the	High	Commissioner	himself:	on	what	grounds	is	he	denying	a
visa	just	for	three	weeks?
The	High	Commissioner	said,	"To	be	frank	with	you,	your	girlfriend	has	nothing
--	no	bank	account,	no	home,	no	particular	reason	why	she	should	come	back	to
India	again."
Vimal	 said	 to	 him,	 "Don't	 be	 afraid	 about	 that.	We	have	 not	 been	 saying	 it	 to
you,	but	we	are	Osho	Rajneesh's	disciples.	She	has	every	reason	to	be	here.	She
has	no	reason	to	be	anywhere	else."
And	Vimal	 has	written	 a	 note	 to	me,	 "The	British	Commissioner	 immediately
gave	 the	 visa.	 He	 said,	 'If	 she	 is	 Osho	 Rajneesh's	 disciple,	 then	 there	 is	 no
problem.'"
It	is	the	first	time	that	my	name	has	been	of	help	--	because	that	makes	it	certain
that	she	will	not	remain	in	England.	"She	can	go	have	a	three	week	trip,	or	if	you
want,	three	months
...	 any	 time.	 We	 were	 worried	 that	 she	 may	 not	 come	 back.	 But	 if	 she	 is	 a
disciple	of	Osho	Rajneesh,	there	is	no	worry."
Life	is	very	strange.	They	were	hiding	my	name,	but	they	forgot	that	my	name
has	 to	 be	 kept	 secret	 if	 you	 are	 coming	FROM	England.	 If	 you	 are	 going	TO
England	it	 is	a	different	story.	The	High	Commissioner	was	perfectly	satisfied;
there	was	no	question	of	asking	any	more	about	the	woman.	She	will	come	back
to	India.
I	 have	 come	 across	many	 sannyasins	who	 just	 heard	my	 name	 and	 something
started	 --	 a	 longing,	 a	 desire	 ...	 as	 if	 a	 forgotten	 language	 suddenly	 is
remembered.	A	master	does	not	work	on	individuals.	He	creates	an	atmosphere
and	 that	 atmosphere	 itself	goes	on	becoming	every	day	 richer,	more	dense.	 Its
pull,	its	gravitation,	goes	on	bringing	new	people	from	faraway	places.
In	 Rancho	 Rajneesh	 in	 America	 ...	 now	 even	 the	 Oregon	 newspapers	 are
accepting	the	fact	that	our	presence	has	made	Oregon	a	world-famous	place.	In
fact	 the	 news	 media	 --	 television,	 radio,	 newspapers,	 magazines	 --	 they	 all
missed.	 They	 had	 a	 tremendously	 beautiful	 story,	 with	 all	 the	 colors	 of	 the
rainbow,	 with	 all	 the	 rumors	 that	 you	 can	 manage.	 We	 gave	 them	 so	 much
material	 and	 we	 allowed	 them	 to	 invent	 whatever	 they	 wanted	 to	 invent.	We
enjoy	it	anyway,	we	don't	make	much	fuss	whether	it	is	true	or	not.	We	kept	the
whole	news	media	busy.
It	is	almost	unbelievable	that	I	was,	for	two	years,	the	first	man	...	I	was	a	tourist
whose	 tourist	 visa	 had	 expired	 years	 before,	 and	 I	was	 chosen	 the	man	of	 the
year	in	Oregon	because	I	was	discussed	more	than	the	president	himself.
Many	times	my	people	said	to	me,	"These	allegations	...	we	should	drag	them	to
the	court."
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	2	-	Dissolved,	just	like	ice
I	 said,	 "Stop	 --	 don't	 bother!	 Let	 them	make	 as	many	 allegations	 as	 possible.
Help	 to	 create	 rumors	 yourself!	 Let	 the	whole	 of	America	 be	 concerned	with
you."	And	we	made,	within	five	years,	the	whole	of	America	concerned.
Now	the	politicians	are	missing	me.	One	of	my	attorneys	came	a	few	days	ago.
He	said,
"Now,	in	Oregon,	the	politicians	are	missing	you	very	much."
I	said,	"Why?"
He	said,	"Because	you	were	a	good	reason	for	 them	to	collect	 the	votes	of	 the
Oregonians,	because	they	all	were	against	you.	Now	there	is	no	reason	why	they
should	 be	 chosen."	 And	 he	 added,	 "The	 newspapers	 are	 missing	 you,	 the
television	is	missing	you."
The	man	Ed	Meese	 said	 in	a	press	conference,	 "All	 that	we	want	 is	 to	 silence
Rajneesh	 absolutely.	He	 should	not	 be	heard	 anywhere,	 he	 should	not	 be	 seen
anywhere.	We	will	close	all	the	doors	to	his	voice."
Anando	has	sent	him	just	now	...	Here	we	are,	ten	thousand	sannyasins,	and	poor
Ed	Meese	has	been	kicked	out	of	his	Attorney	General's	job	because	he	has	been
found	guilty	of	doing	many	criminal	acts.
And	Anando,	 as	my	 secretary,	 has	written	 to	 him	 --	with	 a	 photograph	 of	 ten
thousand	sannyasins,	that	means	twenty	thousand	hands	raised	--	saying,	"Osho
Rajneesh	is	still	being	heard	--	where	are	you?"	It	is	only	a	question	...
In	the	Soviet	Union,	where	it	is	almost	impossible	for	anybody	to	enter,	I	have
my	sannyasins.	They	have	never	seen	me.	They	meet	 in	basements.	They	have
been	 terrorized,	 harassed,	 by	 the	 Russian	 intelligence,	 their	 books	 have	 been
burned.	So	those	poor	Russians	have	to	type	the	books	and,	from	hand	to	hand,
those	books	are	moving	around.
Now	 that	 America	 has	 banned	 me	 from	 entering	 for	 five	 years,	 Russian
intelligence	 has	 relaxed.	 Before	 they	 used	 to	 think	 that	 I	 must	 be	 in	 favor	 of
America	 and	 America's	 capitalism.	 Now	 at	 least	 that	 much	 is	 proved	 --	 that
America	has	closed	its	doors	to	me.
Now	 even	 sannyasins	 in	 the	 Soviet	 Union	 have	 started	 feeling	 that	 they	 can
invite	me	sometime.	Things	are	getting	better,	the	police	are	no	more	harassing
them.
I	 am	 sitting	 here	 in	 my	 room,	 and	 I	 am	 being	 discussed,	 for	 and	 against,	 in
almost	all	the	parliaments	of	the	world.	Articles	arrive	every	day	from	Holland,
from	Germany,	 from	England,	 from	 places	 of	which	 I	 have	 not	 even	 heard	 --
small	places	 ...	Bolivia.	And	 just	now	I	have	received	 their	congratulations	for
my	birthday.	My	sannyasins	in	Bolivia,	in	Yugoslavia,	in	Czechoslovakia	...	it	is
a	contagious	phenomenon.
To	be	a	master	is	almost	like	a	dangerous	disease	moving	like	winds,	like	clouds
...	it	does	not	carry	a	passport,	it	does	not	believe	in	any	boundaries.	A	master's
existence	is	always	universal.	His	focus	cannot	be	on	individuals.	That	will	take
ages	 to	 bring	 enlightenment	 to	 the	 world.	 No,	 it	 is	 not	 a	 retail	 work	 --	 it	 is
wholesale.	When	I	make	you	every	night	enlightened	it	is	wholesale.
And	whatever	vibrations	you	are	gathering,	you	will	be	spreading	without	your
knowing,	wherever	you	go.	I	don't	make	anybody	a	missionary.	I	don't	want	you
to	convert	anybody.	I	want	you	just	to	be	converted	yourself	--	converted	not	to
any	ideology,	converted	to	your	own	truth.	And	suddenly	you	will	start	radiating
a	fragrance	for	which	many	are	thirsty.
Sannyasins	have	 reported	 to	me	 that,	 "It	 is	very	 strange.	We	have	dropped	 the
orange,	we	have	dropped	 the	mala	 just	so	 that	nobody	recognizes	us,"	because
the	governments,	the	Osho	-	The	Miracle
21
Chapter	2	-	Dissolved,	just	like	ice
airports	...	everywhere	the	Americans	influence,	blackmail,	because	they	are	all
indebted	to	America.	The	sannyasins	say,	"It	is	very	strange.	We	are	immediately
recognized,	it	has	made	no	difference.	Even	if	we	say	we	don't	know	who	Osho
Rajneesh	is,	they	say,	'We	know	you	are	a	man	concerned	with	Osho	Rajneesh.
Your	very	eyes	show	it.'"
Now,	I	cannot	take	away	my	people's	eyes.	I	can	give	you	sunglasses,	but	then
you	will	be	recognized	by	your	sunglasses.	Then	nobody	else	in	the	world	will
be	able	to	wear	sunglasses.
We	can	have	a	hilarious	time:	whoever	wears	sunglasses	is	a	sannyasin.
Dogen	does	not	understand	 that	 the	work	of	a	master	 is	very	subtle,	very	 fine.
And	it	is	not	in	the	realm	of	the	visible,	it	is	in	the	realm	of	the	invisible,	so	you
don't	see	it	but	you	know	it	is	spreading.
So	much	 fear	 in	politicians	of	a	man	who	has	no	nuclear	weapons,	not	even	a
vegetable	cutting	knife	...	I	have	not	seen	with	my	own	eyes	a	vegetable	cutting
knife.	I	don't	know	who	cuts	my	vegetables.
Why	this	fear?	It	seems	the	very	air	is	ready	for	me.	The	young	people	around
the	 world	 are	 searching	 for	 something.	 They	 are	 not	 satisfied	 with	 their	 own
churches,	they	are	not	satisfied	with	their	religions	or	their	leaders.	There	is	an
immense	discontent	all	over	the	world.	That	is	the	fear	of	the	politicians:	that	I
can	catch	up	with	the	youth	--	with	the	young,	with	the	fresh,	with	the	intelligent.
It	 is	better	 to	avoid	me.	But	 the	more	 they	 try	 to	avoid,	 the	more	 they	make	 it
clear	to	their	people	that	if	these	politicians	are	afraid	of	a	man	who	has	not	done
any	harm	to	anybody,	then	it	is	worthwhile	to	go	to	that	man.
Half	 of	 my	 people	 here	 are	 from	 Germany.	 It	 is	 because	 of	 the	 German
politicians	 who	 are	 working	 in	 my	 favor	 by	 making	 laws	 against	 me.	 The
intelligent	 youth	 can	 see	 that	 if	 these	politicians	 are	 so	much	 afraid	of	 a	man,
then	it	is	better	to	go	and	not	to	miss	the	opportunity.
A	master	functions	like	free	air	--	it	goes	on	around	the	earth	like	radiation.
Dogen	must	have	said	these	things	when	he	was	not	himself	a	master.	But	a	few
points	of	what	he	is	saying	are,	by	chance,	important.	TRUE	ASPIRANTS	--	I
drop	off	the	OF
BUDDHISM.	A	true	aspirant	does	not	remain	stuck	being	a	student	because	as	a
student	he	can	only	be	burdened	with	borrowed	knowledge.	He	can	see	that	it	is
not	his	experience.	A	true	aspirant	wants	to	know	things	as	his	own	experience.
He	immediately	becomes	a	disciple.
But	 the	 disciple	 has	 a	 few	 difficulties;	 it	 depends	 on	 both	 the	master	 and	 the
disciple	how	great	those	difficulties	will	be.	First,	THEY	HAVE	NO	EAR	FOR
HIS	TEACHINGS.
According	 to	me,	 there	 are	 no	 teachings,	 but	 only	 a	 presence.	You	 don't	 need
ears,	you	need	a	heart	which	can	drink	the	presence	of	a	master.
And	he	is	saying,	THEY	HAVE	NO	EAR	FOR	HIS	TEACHINGS,	HOWEVER
HARD
HE	MAY	TRY	TO	LEAD	THEM.	Sheer	nonsense!	A	master	never	 tries	hard.
When	 a	 thing	 can	 be	 done	 very	 easily,	 only	 idiots	 try	 hard.	 And	 when	 you
understand	 the	 way	 an	 energy	 phenomenon	 works	 it	 is	 only	 a	 question	 of
triggering.	It	is	not	a	hard	job.	It	is	the	most	easy	job,	otherwise	I	would	not	have
chosen	it.
I	am	myself	an	example:	a	lazy	man	who	has	never	done	anything.	I	saw	that	it
seems	enlightenment	is	perfectly	in	tune	with	laziness	and	I	immediately	became
enlightened.	 I	 did	 not	 have	 second	 thoughts.	 For	 thirty	 years	 I	 have	 been
enlightened	and	not	for	a	single	Osho	-	The	Miracle
22
Chapter	2	-	Dissolved,	just	like	ice
moment	I	have	doubted.	In	fact	I	am	so	lazy	I	will	not	doubt;	doubting	also	takes
effort.	And	once	I	have	become	enlightened,	why	unnecessarily	bother?
You	 go	 on	 doing	 hard	 things.	 You	 become	 enlightened,	 you	 become
unenlightened.	And	next	day	when	you	see	me	you	again	remember	that	you	are
a	buddha.	In	this	hall	only	buddhas	sit.	It	is	so	easy	to	be	silent,	it	is	so	easy	to	be
watchful;	it	is	not	an	arduous	thing.	But	all	old	masters	made	it	seem	like	a	very
arduous	thing.
It	 is	 true	 that	very	few	have	the	courage	to	open	their	hearts	so	 the	master	can
pour	himself	into	them.	But	it	is	not	a	question	of	any	teachings;	no	master	worth
the	name	has	any	teachings.	He	certainly	has	some	insights	to	share.	He	does	not
argue,	he	does	not	want	 to	 convince	you.	He	has	no	 investment	 in	 convincing
you.	He	is	not	interested	in	converting	you	to	be	a	follower.	It	is	his	joy	to	share
the	bliss	he	has,	because	the	more	he	shares	it,	the	more	he	has.	It	is	not	out	of
compassion;	it	is	out	of	a	simple	understanding	that	the	more	you	share	your	joy,
the	 more	 there	 is.	 It	 is	 a	 strange	 arithmetic:	 the	 more	 you	 give,	 the	 more	 is
received	by	your	heart	from	the	unknown	sources	of	existence.
Dogen	 is	 certainly	 very	 immature.	BUT	WHEN	THEY	GIVE	EAR	TO	HIM,
HIS
SERMON	 IS	 ALREADY	 FINISHED.	 That	 is	 true.	 If	 the	 master	 is	 only
concerned	with	 teachings,	 then	by	the	 time	the	person	is	ready	to	 listen	to	him
the	 sermon	 is	 over.	But	 the	 authentic	master	 is	 a	 teaching	 himself.	He	 simply
provokes	 in	 you	 a	 synchronicity.	He	 brings	 you	 closer	 to	 his	 heart,	 his	 being,
because	that	is	the	door	to	the	universal	heart.	It	is	an	alchemical	transformation;
it	is	not	a	scholarly	job.
WHEN	 AN	 OLD	 ZEN	 MASTER	 LAUGHS	 LOUDLY,	 CLAPPING	 HIS
HANDS,	 BEGINNERS	 AND	 LATER-DAY	 TRAINEES	 IN	 BUDDHISM
SEEM	TO	HAVE
DIFFICULTY	 EVEN	 IN	 HAVING	 A	 CHANCE	 TO	 FIND	 THEMSELVES
AMONG	THE
ATTENDANTS.
When	the	old	Zen	master	laughs	...	if	you	start	thinking	about	why	he	is	laughing
you	have	missed.	He	is	simply	enjoying	it.	And	if	you	understand	the	point,	you
should	 join	 him	 in	 his	 laughter.	You	will	 find	 that	 you	 are	 laughing	 in	 a	 very
fresh	and	new	way.	You	have	laughed	before;	it	was	very	ordinary.	This	time	it
seems	to	be	very	precious.	It	has	reflected	the	laughter	of	the	master	also.	It	has
joined	hands	with	a	tremendous	energy,	it	has	reflected	the	full	moon.
Your	laughter	has	been	a	laughter	in	dark	tunnels.	You	have	laughed	because	you
wanted	 to	hide	your	misery.	You	 laughed	because	you	did	not	want	 to	 expose
your	sufferings	to	others.	Your	laughter	was	a	defensive	device.
But	when	 a	master	 laughs	 it	 has	 nothing	 to	 do	with	 anything	 to	 hide.	On	 the
contrary,	he	is	laughing	because	he	can	see	his	buddhahood	and	he	can	see	your
buddhahood,	 and	 he	 cannot	 believe	 how	 you	 buddhas	 can	 manage	 to	 be	 in
suffering.	 This	 is	 the	 most	 unbelievable	 thing:	 that	 a	 buddha	 is	 in	 misery.
Carrying	essentially	the	buddhahood,	how	can	you	be	in	misery?
How	can	you	be	in	suffering?	How	can	you	be	dry	and	not	blossoming?
Zen	 is	 a	 participation	 with	 the	 master's	 being.	 He	 laughs	 and	 you	 join	 in	 his
laughter,	 not	 even	 bothering	 why	 he	 is	 laughing.	 The	 question	 "why?"	 is	 the
most	stupid	question.	Why	are	the	roses	so	beautiful?	Why	are	the	clouds	today
silent?	Why	do	the	bamboos	go	on	growing?
Everything	simply	is.	At	the	moment	the	master	feels	like	laughing	he	does	not
ask	himself	why.	His	laughter	is	just	like	a	flower.	The	bush	does	not	ask,	"Why
has	this	rose	arisen	in	me?"	The	bush	enjoys	the	dance	of	the	rose,	its	beauty	and
its	fragrance,	without	any	Osho	-	The	Miracle
23
Chapter	2	-	Dissolved,	just	like	ice
questioning.	Existence	has	no	rationality	in	it.	It	is	beyond	reason,	hence	there	is
no	question	of	any	teaching.	The	question	is	only	of	sharing.
SOME	OF	THEM	REALIZE	THE	INNERMOST	DEPTHS	OF	THE	MASTER,
AND
OTHERS,	 NOT.	 SOME	 HEAR	 THE	 CORE	 OF	 THE	 MASTER'S
ENLIGHTENMENT,	AND	OTHERS,	NOT.
You	can	see	the	statement	seems	to	be	a	footnote	by	a	disciple,	because	a	master
does	 not	 speak	 about	 great	 things	 as	 if	 he	 has	 heard	 about	 them.	He	 has	 seen
them.	He	is	 talking	about	 things	 that	may	be	happening.	Some	people	hear	 the
master	and	some	people	don't	hear.
TIME	 FLIES	 FASTER	 THAN	 AN	 ARROW;	 LIFE	 IS	 MORE	 TRANSIENT
THAN	 A	 DEWDROP.	 SOME	 MAY	 HAVE	 THE	 MASTER,	 BUT	 REGRET
THAT	THEY	CANNOT
HEAR	HIS	TEACHINGS.	SOME	WISH	TO	LISTEN	TO	HIS	TEACHINGS,
BUT	REGRET
THAT	THEY	CANNOT	SEE	THE	MASTER	HIMSELF.
Unfortunately,	Dogen	is	still	not	a	master.	I	have	just	finished	a	series	on	Dogen.
Those	 were	 the	 statements	 when	 he	 must	 have	 become	 a	 master.	 But	 these
statements,	without	any	doubt,	show	that	he	has	taken	notes	but	has	no	authority
of	his	own.	A	master	speaks	with	authority,	 the	authority	 that	comes	out	of	his
own	experience.
ON	ANOTHER	OCCASION,	DOGEN	SAID:
MY	OWN	MASTER	NEVER	EASILY	PERMITTED	NEW	MONKS	TO	STAY
IN	HIS
TEMPLE.
Now	 it	 is	 impossible	 for	 a	master	 to	do	 such	an	unkind	act.	Everybody	has	 to
begin	 someday.	Everybody	 is	 new	 ...	 even	 those	who	 are	 old	 disciples	 started
one	 day	 as	 new	 disciples.	 Now,	 not	 to	 permit	 the	 new	 monks	 to	 stay	 in	 the
temple	is	sheer	unkindness,	and	that	is	not	a	sign	of	a	master.	Perhaps	Dogen	has
stayed	with	a	teacher.
And	 when	 he	 rejected	 people,	 USUALLY	 SAYING,	 "THOSE,	 WHO,
LACKING	IN	THE
BODHI-MIND,	 BEHAVE	 THEMSELVES	 MERELY	 FROM	 FORCE	 OF
HABIT	MUST
NOT	STAY	HERE."	HAVING	TURNED	THEM	OUT,	HE	SAID,	"THEY	ARE
LACKING
IN	 THE	 BODHI-SEEKING	 MIND.	 WHAT	 ARE	 THEY	 GOING	 TO	 DO?
SUCH	FELLOWS
ONLY	DISTURB	OTHERS."
Not	 only	 was	 Dogen	 not	 a	 master	 at	 the	 time	 these	 words	 were	 written,	 his
master	also	was	not	a	master.
The	 very	miracle	 of	 the	master	 is	 to	 transform	 the	 disciple.	 I	 cannot	 conceive
that	a	master	will	reject	anyone.	The	very	foundation	of	Zen	is	that	everybody	is
a	buddha,	whether	he	knows	it	or	not.	The	function	of	the	master	is	very	easy:
just	to	help	the	person	to	remember	his	self-nature.	There	is	nowhere	one	has	to
go,	 no	 discipline	 has	 to	 be	 enforced,	 no	 self-torture	 ...	 just	 a	 silent	 searching
within	oneself.	And	the	master	creates	the	atmosphere.
You	 see	 the	miracle	 every	 day.	The	 new	person	 comes	 and	 as	 he	 joins	 in	 this
energy	 field	 he	 becomes	 as	 old	 as	 you	 are.	 His	 laughter	 is	 as	 deep	 as	 yours.
Perhaps	one	day	he	may	hesitate,	but	the	next	day	he	will	see	that	everybody	is
laughing	--	"Why	should	I	hesitate?"
Perhaps	one	day	he	will	not	die,	but	when	he	sees	another	day	 that	everybody
here	dies	and	comes	back,	then	there	is	no	fear	in	dying	...	one	can	die.
The	 newcomer	 becomes	 very	 soon	 an	 old	 disciple,	 just	within	 days.	 I	 can	 see
when	 the	 newcomer	 for	 the	 first	 time	 enters	 the	 Buddha	 Hall	 he	 is	 hesitant,
worried	what	is	going	to	Osho	-	The	Miracle

happen,	cannot	understand	how	he	is	going	to	do	gibberish.	But	any	child	can	do
gibberish,	 it	 doesn't	 need	 any	 training.	 From	 the	 very	 first	 moment	 you	 are
almost	trained.	Gibberish	needs	no	training,	nor	does	laughter	need	any	training.
If	you	can	do	the	gibberish	you	are	cleansing	your	mind	of	all	kinds	of	dust	that
goes	 on	 gathering.	And	 as	 the	mind	 becomes	 silent	 ...	 there	 is	 nowhere	 to	 go
other	 than	 inwards.	 All	 roads	 are	 forgotten,	 there	 remains	 a	 single	 one-way
traffic.
Just	 for	 a	 day	 or	 two	 you	 may	 hesitate	 to	 go	 that	 much	 inside.	 Who	 knows
whether	 you	 will	 be	 able	 to	 come	 back	 or	 not?	 That's	 the	 whole	 purpose	 of
creating	an	energy	field	--	so	that	you	can	see	that	so	many	people	are	coming
and	going,	becoming	enlightened,	unenlightened.	It	is	a	playful,	joyful	exercise;
there	is	nothing	to	be	worried	about,	you	can	go	as	deep	as	you	want.	And	when
everybody	else	is	going,	in	that	tremendous	storm	it	is	so	easy	to	join.	Alone	you
may	 find	 it	 difficult	 to	 do	 gibberish,	 but	when	 ten	 thousand	 people	 go	 simply
with	their	wings,	not	knowing	Chinese	but	speaking	Chinese,	not	knowing	what
they	 are	 saying	 but	 saying	 it	 very	 emphatically,	 not	 bothering	 at	 all	 who	 is
listening	...
Nobody	 is	 listening,	 so	 you	 can	 say	 anything	 you	want,	 you	 are	 not	 going	 to
offend	anybody.	There	is	nobody	other	than	you.	Such	an	absolute	freedom	you
will	 not	 find	 even	 when	 you	 are	 alone.	 And	 everybody	 helps	 to	 trigger
everybody	else.	When	you	see	your	neighbor	is	going	nuts	the	resistance	drops.
Everybody	is	going	nuts	and	everybody	is	enjoying	it	so	much,	why	not	take	a
little	step	and	be	nuts,	only	for	two	minutes?
That	will	make	you	saner	than	you	have	ever	been,	because	you	throw	so	much
garbage	that	you	were	holding.	Do	you	think	your	gibberish	is	coming	from	the
sky?	 You	 are	 carrying	 all	 that	 garbage,	 throw	 it!	 And	 don't	 be	 worried	 that,
"What	 will	 the	 others	 say?"	 They	 are	 throwing	 their	 garbage,	 nobody	 is
interested	in	anybody	else.	Although	thousands	of	people	are	doing	it,	everybody
is	doing	it	on	his	own.
Just	one	 thing	 I	have	 to	warn	you:	don't	 sit	 silently	when	people	 are	 throwing
garbage,	because	that	garbage	tends	to	find	new	spaces	again,	some	new	house.
So	outdo	each	other,	don't	be	worried;	it	is	a	great	competitive	phenomenon.	If
you	are	just	a	little	polite	you	are	in	a	danger.	It	is	not	a	question	of	being	polite,
because	people	are	throwing	all	kinds	of	poisons.
To	keep	their	poisons	from	entering	in	you,	you	have	to	be	on	top	of	it.	Such	a
joy,	and	with	no	ticket!	You	will	not	have	such	a	joy	even	in	a	madhouse!
Just	 do	 it	 totally,	 enthusiastically.	 Don't	 be	 bothered	 whether	 it	 is	 Arabic	 or
Hebrew	or	Chinese,	you	are	allowed	to	speak	any	language	that	you	don't	know.
Just	 avoid	 the	 language	 that	 you	 do	 know,	 because	 the	 language	 that	 you	 do
know	will	not	bring	your	nonsense	out,	it	will	be	very	grammatical.
Just	be	careful	that	you	are	not	writing	a	meaningful	poetry	or	prose.	Meaning	is
not	 at	 all	 the	 requirement.	 Just	 for	 two	 minutes	 give	 an	 opportunity	 to	 your
existence	to	be	meaningless.
And	you	will	be	 immensely	shocked	to	know	that	 just	within	two	minutes	you
become	so	light,	so	ready	to	enter	into	silence.
A	master's	function	is	not	to	reject	anybody,	because	anybody	who	is	coming	is	a
buddha	 in	disguise,	you	have	 just	 to	help	him	 to	discover	his	buddhahood.	He
knows	 in	his	deepest	being	but	he	has	 forgotten	 the	way.	Meditation	 is	 just	 to
help	him	to	find	the	way.	And	the	way	is	not	very	long,	it	is	very	short.	From	the
head	 to	 the	 heart	 how	 many	 inches?	 From	 the	 heart	 to	 the	 being	 how	 many
inches?	 And	 from	 the	 being	 to	 the	 universal	 being	 ...	 just	 a	 single	 step.	 The
reality	is	so	close	to	you,	you	are	just	standing	on	the	boundary	of	it.

The	master	 --	 any	master	worth	 his	 salt	 --	will	 not	 reject	 anybody,	 because	 to
reject	 anybody	 is	 to	 reject	 a	 buddha.	 He	 may	 be	 hiding	 himself,	 he	 may	 be
thinking	himself	somebody	else,	but	it	is	a	great	joy	to	remind	him.
The	master	is	just	a	reminder.
Certainly	 Dogen	 was	 not	 with	 a	 master,	 because	 that	 master	 used	 to	 say,
"Because	they	are	not	yet	buddhas,	I	will	not	accept	them."	That	is	almost	like
telling	 a	 sick	 person,	 "The	 doctor	 will	 not	 accept	 you	 because	 you	 are	 sick.
When	you	are	healthy	come	back!"
When	one	is	healthy	one	does	not	come	back	to	the	doctor.
You	are	all	buddhas,	whether	you	know	it	or	not	...	but	I	know	it,	so	it	is	only	a
question	 of	 creating	 a	 certain	 climate	 in	 which	 you	 also	 become	 part	 of	 the
knowing	that	I	am	ready	to	share	with	you.
DOGEN	 CONTINUED:	 SEEING	 AND	 PERSONALLY	 HEARING	 THIS
FACT,	I	SAID
TO	MYSELF:	"LIVING	AS	THEY	ARE,	IN	THIS	COUNTRY,	WHAT	SIN	OR
CRIME	IN
THEIR	PREVIOUS	EXISTENCE,	PREVENTS	THEM	FROM	LIVING	WITH
MY
MASTER?	"
Now	 he	 is	 thinking	 that	 the	master	 is	 right,	 and	 these	 fellows	 who	 are	 being
rejected	must	have	committed	some	grave	sins	in	their	past	lives,	that's	why	the
master	is	not	accepting	them.	The	truth	is,	the	master	is	not	the	master.
There	 is	 a	Tibetan	 story	 ...	An	old	master	 refused	his	whole	 life	 to	accept	any
disciple.	His	name	became	more	and	more	famous,	people	from	all	parts	of	Tibet
used	 to	 come	 to	 him	 to	 be	 accepted	 as	 a	 disciple.	 It	 had	 become	 almost	 a
craziness	 in	 all	 the	 seekers	 to	 see	who	was	 going	 to	 be	 accepted	 first.	But	 he
never	accepted	anyone.
But	on	the	day	he	was	dying	he	simply	called	his	servant	and	told	him,	"Just	go
to	the	marketplace	and	tell	whoever	wants	to	be	a	disciple	that	I	am	ready,	come!
--	because	today	I	am	going	to	die."
Even	 the	 servant	 could	 not	 believe,	 "Has	 he	 gone	 insane	 or	 senile	 or	 what?
Because	his	whole	 life	he	has	been	refusing	--	even	kings	had	been	rejected	--
and	now	he	is	saying,	'Go	to	the	marketplace	...	tell	anybody!'"
The	servant	said,	"Are	you	in	your	senses	when	you	are	saying	this?"
The	master	laughed,	he	said,	"Don't	waste	time,	because	this	evening	is	my	last
evening.	I	was	rejecting	the	disciples	up	to	now	because	I	was	not	a	master.	Just
this	morning	as	 the	sun	was	 rising	 I	became	 the	master,	 I	became	enlightened.
Now	 I	 can	 see	 the	 buddhahood	of	 everyone.	So	 don't	 be	worried,	 just	 go!	Go
around	the	town	and	declare,	'Whoever	wants	to	become	a	disciple,	come	soon,
the	master	will	not	be	available	tomorrow.'"
People	could	not	believe	the	servant,	they	thought,	"It	must	be	some	kind	of	joke
--	that	old	fellow	has	rejected	even	kings."
One	 man's	 wife	 had	 died	 and	 he	 was	 thinking,	 "What	 to	 do	 now?"	 Getting
married	again	meant	getting	into	another	tragedy.	Somehow	existence	has	saved
him,	one	tragedy	has	ended
...	but	sitting	without	doing	anything	looks	crazy.	And	he	thought,	"What	is	the
problem?	The	old	man	 is	going	 to	die	 tonight.	 If	he	can	make	me	enlightened
today	there	is	no	harm,	and	tomorrow	I	will	be	free	to	choose	whether	I	want	to
remain	enlightened	or	not."

So	 a	 few	 people	 ...	 somebody	 was	 there	 on	 a	 holiday,	 somebody	 was
unemployed	and	 just	 sitting	because	 there	was	no	 job	 --	 thirteen	people	 in	all.
The	 servant	 brought	 a	 very	 strange	 company.	 One	man	was	 going	 to	 commit
suicide	but	he	 thought,	 "It	 is	better	 first	 to	become	enlightened,	suicide	can	be
done	afterwards."
One	man	was	a	known	thief;	he	thought,	"It	is	a	good	opportunity,	it	must	be	a
great	gathering.	In	a	big	gathering	you	can	cut	a	few	pockets,	there	is	no	harm	in
it,	and	if	you	happen	to	become	enlightened	..."
Nobody	thought	about	 it,	and	nobody	took	it	seriously,	but	 they	had	some	free
time	...	The	servant	went	inside	the	cave	where	the	old	master	lived	and	he	said,
"I	have	brought	thirteen	people,	but	I	cannot	say	they	are	aspirants.	They	are	just
a	useless	lot,	I	know	every	one	of	them.	One	was	determined	to	commit	suicide,
I	 told	 him,	 'You	 can	 commit	 afterwards,	 what	 is	 the	 hurry?'	 One	 is	 a	 thief	 at
night,	so	in	the	day	he	is	free.	I	am	ashamed,"	the	servant	said,	"to	bring	this	lot,
but	what	can	I	do?	You	told	..."
The	master	said,	"There	is	no	problem.	Bring	each	one	of	them,	because	they	are
all	buddhas."
And	he	called	that	random	selection	of	thirteen	and	he	said	to	them,	"You	are	all
buddhas.
I	was	refusing	up	to	now	because	I	was	not	enlightened	myself,	and	I	could	not
accept	 a	 disciple	 because	 that	 would	 be	 a	 deception.	 This	 morning	 I	 have
become	 a	 buddha	 and	 this	 evening	 I	 am	 going	 to	 disappear	 into	 the	 universe.
Meanwhile,	if	any	of	you	want	to	share	my	being,	just	sit	silently	around	me."
They	looked	at	each	other	...	whether	to	sit	around	him	or	not?	But	now	that	they
had	 come	 so	 far	 into	 the	 forest,	 into	 the	mountains,	 they	 thought,	 "It	 is	worth
trying,	and	anyway	he	is	not	asking	any	fee	or	anything."
The	 story	 is	 ...	 the	 man	 died	 and	 those	 thirteen	 people	 became	 enlightened,
because	when	an	enlightened	master	dies	he	radiates	tremendous	energy	around
himself.	They	had	entered	into	the	cave	very	ordinary	people,	they	came	out	of
the	cave	brilliant	buddhas.
Dogen	must	have	been	in	the	company	of	a	man	who	himself	was	not	a	master
but	 a	 pretender.	 Because	 he	 was	 accepted	 by	 the	 master	 he	 thinks,	 UNDER
WHAT	 A	 LUCKY	 STAR	 I	 WAS	 BORN	 THAT,	 COMING	 FROM	 A	 FAR-
DISTANT	FOREIGN	COUNTRY,	I	AM	PERMITTED	TO	STAY	HERE	TO
WORSHIP	HIS	VENERABLE	BODY	AND	TO	LISTEN	TO	HIS	SERMON!
FOOLISH	AS
I	 AM,	 I	 HAVE	 BEEN	 ABLE	 TO	 FORM	 A	 GOOD	 AND	 FRUITFUL
CONNECTION	WITH
HIM.
You	don't	make	a	fruitful	connection	with	a	master.	In	fact,	either	you	dissolve
into	 the	 master	 or	 you	 remain	 yourself.	 'Connection'	 is	 a	 wrong	 word.
Connection	means	that	the	two	remain	two;	they	just	found	a	way	of	relating	to
each	other	that	they	call	a	connection.	I	will	not	say	that	you	are	connected	with
me	or	I	am	connected	with	you.	Here	there	is	only	one	consciousness!
You	have	to	understand	that	to	be	with	a	master	is	not	to	be	connected,	it	is	to	be
dissolved,	just	like	ice	dissolves.

Philosophy	is	speculation,	Zen	is	participation.	Participate	 in	 the	night	 leaving,
participate	 in	 the	evening	coming,	participate	 in	 the	stars	and	participate	 in	 the
clouds;	make	participation	your	lifestyle	and	the	whole	existence	becomes	such
a	joy,	such	an	ecstasy.	You	could	not	have	dreamt	of	a	better	universe.

Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
YOU	SEEM	TO	BE	THROWING	US	BACK	TO	OURSELVES	MORE	AND
MORE
LATELY,	REMINDING	US	THAT	YOU	HAVE	DISAPPEARED,	SO	THERE
IS	NO	ONE
TO	RELATE	TO.
BY	WHAT	MAY	WE	GAUGE	IF	WE	HAVE	A	"GOOD	AND	FRUITFUL"
CONNECTION,	WHEN	WE	ARE	CONNECTING	WITH	NO	ONE?
Maneesha,	 don't	 commit	 the	 same	mistake	 that	Dogen	 committed.	There	 is	 no
need	 of	 any	 connection,	 because	 connection	means	 you	 are	 separate;	 drop	 all
ideas	of	connecting.	Just	like	a	wave	disappears	into	the	ocean,	let	this	place	be
an	ocean	where	you	all	disappear.
You	cannot	have	any	connection	with	me,	because	I	am	not	there.	But	you	can
dissolve	 into	 the	 same	 silence	 and	 the	 same	 space	 where	 I	 used	 to	 be	 once;
where	for	thirty	years	I	have	not	been.	If	you	want	to	enter	into	an	uninhabited
house,	it	is	up	to	you.	It	is	dilapidated,	but	if	you	want	to	enter	the	space	...	the
walls	may	have	fallen,	the	roof	may	have	fallen,	but	the	space	is	still	there	and
has	been	always	there.	When	the	walls	were	standing,	it	was	there;	now	the	walls
are	 not,	 it	 is	 still	 there.	You	 cannot	 connect	with	 it	 but	 you	 can	 join,	 you	 can
participate.
Remember,	Dogen's	thought	was	not	a	mature	thought	of	a	master.	Your	question
has	 arisen	 out	 of	 Dogen's	 GOOD	AND	 FRUITFUL	CONNECTION	with	 the
master.	With	the	master	you	don't	have	any	connection	at	all,	because	the	master
is	the	name	of	an	absence.	He	is	no	more!	Just	an	open	sky	...	what	connection
can	 you	 have	 with	 the	 open	 sky?	 You	 can	 disappear	 into	 it,	 but	 it	 will	 be
participation,	and	only	participation	is	significant.
Before	 we	 enter	 into	 this	 evening's	 meditation,	 into	 a	 great	 participation,
dissolving	 ourselves	 into	 an	 ocean	of	 consciousness	 ...	 just	 to	make	you	 light,
just	to	make	you	playful,	not	serious	...
Ronald	Reagan	has	gone	deaf,	so	he	calls	in	the	White	House	doctor.
Doctor	Spook	immediately	looks	in	the	President's	ear.	"Why	do	you	have	that
suppository	in	your	ear?"	he	asks.
Reagan	says	nothing.
"Why	do	you	have	that	suppository	in	your	ear?"	shouts	Spook.
"What?"	replies	Reagan.
Doctor	 Spook	 pulls	 the	 suppository	 out	 of	 the	 President's	 ear	 and	 shows	 it	 to
him.
Reagan's	face	lights	up.	"A-ha!"	he	says,	"now	I	know	where	I	put	my	hearing
aid!"

"So	tell	me	the	bad	news,"	says	Jablonski.
"Okay,"	 says	 Jezebel,	 "the	 bad	 news	 is	 that	 Jerry	 junior	 grabbed	 your	 pet

"What?"	shrieks	Jablonski.	"That's	ghastly!	What	could	the	good	news	possibly

Rufus,	the	big	black	guy,	is	fed	up	with	living	in	Mississippi,	so	he	goes	to	the
station	to	catch	a	bus	north	to	Chicago.
Looking	around	the	bus	station,	he	suddenly	notices	a	weighing	scale	 that	 tells
your	weight	and	also	your	fortune.
Rufus	 goes	 over	 to	 the	 scale,	 steps	 on	 it,	 and	 drops	 in	 a	 quarter.	A	 little	 card
shoots	out	that	reads:	"You	weigh	one	hundred	and	fifty	pounds,	you	are	black,
and	you	need	to	go	to	the	bathroom."
"Mmm,"	says	Rufus,	"I	guess	I	do."	He	goes	to	the	bathroom,	but	all	he	does	is
pass	wind.
He	decides	to	try	the	machine	again,	so	he	digs	out	another	quarter	and	drops	it
into	 the	slot.	The	 little	card	shoots	out	and	Rufus	reads	 it.	 It	 says,	"You	weigh
one	hundred	and	fifty	pounds,	you	are	black,	and	 the	waitress	 in	 the	snack	bar
would	like	to	meet	you."
So	Rufus	goes	to	the	snack	bar,	strikes	up	a	conversation	with	the	waitress,	and
they	end	up	screwing	behind	the	counter.
Very	pleased,	Rufus	returns	again	to	the	machine	for	another	try.	This	time	the
card	shoots	out	and	reads,	"You	are	still	one	hundred	and	fifty	pounds,	you	are
still	a	nigger,	and	with	all	this	fucking	and	farting	around	you	have	missed	your
bus!"

AN	 ANCIENT	 SAID:	 ALL	 THOSE	 WHO	 STRIVE	 OUTWARDLY	 ARE
STUPID.
SUFFICE	 IT	 TO	 BE	 ONE'S	 OWN	 MASTER	 WHEREVER	 ONE	 MAY
HAPPEN	TO	BE,	AND	REALITY	WILL	PREVAIL	EVERYWHERE.	THUS

OUT	THROUGH
YOUR	 FOREHEAD.	 I	 URGE	 THOSE	 WHO	 HAVE	 NOT	 EXPERIENCED
THIS,	TO	TRY
TO	SEE	IT.
Maneesha,	Zen	is	for	the	simple,	for	the	ordinary,	for	the	natural.	But	the	mind	of
man	is	for	just	the	opposite;	it	wants	to	be	extraordinary,	it	wants	to	be	special,	it
wants	to	be	known.
Respectability,	 reputation,	 honor,	 riches	 --	 they	 are	 all	 desires	 for	making	 you
special.
But	 to	 be	 special	 is	 against	 nature.	 In	 nature	 everything	 is	 as	 it	 is.	Nobody	 is
feeling	 any	 inferiority	 complex,	 and	 nobody	 is	 suffering	 from	 any	 superiority
complex.	The	roses	are	beautiful	because	they	don't	claim	any	superiority.	There
are	thousands	of	flowers	but	there	is	no	competition,	everything	is	unique	in	its
simplicity.	They	are	not	running	a	marathon	race,	competing	with	each	other	to
come	 first;	 they	 are	 immensely	 satisfied	 as	 they	 are.	 In	 the	 whole	 animal
kingdom	--	and	all	 the	 trees,	all	 the	clouds,	all	 the	stars	 --	nobody	wants	 to	be
something	 else.	 Because	 even	 if	 you	 try	 to	 be	 something	 else,	 it	will	 be	 only
phony.

Chapter	3	-	Unhitch	the	Universe
In	 this	 sense	 all	 the	 religions	 have	 committed	 a	 great	 crime	 against	 humanity,
because	 they	 all	 want	 you	 to	 be	 saints,	 great	 saints.	 They	 have	 categories	 of
austerities,	 they	have	categories	of	respectability.	The	so-called	religions	of	 the
world	are	part	of	the	same	game	that	is	being	played	in	the	marketplace,	that	is
being	played	by	the	politicians.	Everybody	wants	to	have	a	position.	He	is	ready
to	 lose	 himself,	 to	 sell	 himself,	 for	 a	 position.	 That's	what	 has	 happened,	 and
everybody	has	lost	his	simplicity.
I	 came	 first	 in	 the	 whole	 university	 in	 my	 post-graduate	 examinations.	 My
grandfather	was	a	very	simple	man	...	knowing	nothing	of	Zen,	but	he	was	a	man
of	Zen.	When	I	told	him	that	I	got	the	gold	medal	for	being	the	first	in	the	whole
university,	he	looked	at	me	and	he	said,
"That	 simply	 means	 you	 were	 studying	 with	 fools;	 otherwise	 how	 could	 you
manage	to	be	first?"	Rather	than	being	happy,	he	was	angry	with	me,	"Don't	you
feel	ashamed?"
I	said	"My	God,	I	was	thinking	that	you	would	appreciate	..."
He	said,	"I	would	have	appreciated	it	if	you	had	given	the	chance	to	somebody
else,	 but	 you	 grabbed	 the	 gold	 medal	 yourself.	 This	 is	 very	 ungainly,
ungraceful."
I	 said,	 "You	 will	 be	 happy	 to	 know	 that	 I	 have	 not	 brought	 the	 gold	 medal
home."
I	had	dropped	it	in	the	university	well.	I	had	told	the	vice-chancellor	that	it	did
not	matter	to	me,	and	to	prove	it	I	threw	it	in	the	big	well	that	supplied	the	water
to	the	whole	university.
Everybody	thought	I	was	crazy.	Even	the	vice-chancellor	said,	"This	is	carrying
the	argument	too	far."
I	 said,	 "It	 is	 not	 an	 argument.	 I'm	 simply	 telling	 you	 that	 I	 don't	 believe	 in	 a
system	 of	 education	 which	 creates	 categories:	 first	 class,	 second	 class,	 third
class.	Everybody	is	just	himself,	this	classification	is	a	dangerous	phenomenon."
My	grandfather	said,	"That	is	good,	if	you	have	thrown	that	gold	medal.	You	did
well.	And	never	again	do	such	a	thing."
I	said,	"I	have	done	nothing.	They	simply	gave	it	 to	me;	 it	was	not	my	fault.	 I
had	done	everything	not	to	have	it."
I	was	 not	 attending	 the	 classes,	 I	was	 prohibited	 from	 attending	 the	 classes.	 I
never	 purchased	 a	 single	 book	 that	 was	 prescribed	 by	 the	 university.	 I	 was
purchasing	strange	books	which	had	nothing	 to	do	with	 the	examination.	Even
my	professors	were	worried.	They	loved	me.	They	said,	"You	are	losing	a	great
opportunity.	You	have	every	chance	to	be	the	first	in	the	whole	university,	but	we
never	see	you	reading	anything	that	is	prescribed."
How	strange	are	the	ways	of	life.	It	was	because	of	this	I	came	first	--	because	all
the	 other	 students'	 answers	were	 repetitive.	Only	my	 answers	were	 original	 --
original	in	the	sense	that	I	was	answering	them	not	only	for	the	examination,	not
for	any	gain,	but	 just	 to	enjoy	 the	answering	 ...	 just	as	 I	enjoy	answering	your
questions.	 I	 even	 said,	 "This	 question	 is	 absolutely	wrong,	 it	 does	 not	 deserve
any	answer.	And	if	I	can	find	the	man	who	asked	it,	I	will	hit	him."
Later	my	professor	said,	"That	examination	was	prepared	by	me,	and	I	have	read
your	answer.	I	understand	that	you	are	right,	the	question	was	stupid."
The	 question	 was,	 "What	 is	 the	 difference	 between	 Indian	 philosophy	 and
Western	 philosophy?"	 And	 naturally	 I	 said,	 "Philosophy	 is	 not	 geographical.
Philosophy	is	simply	philosophy.	What	does	it	have	to	do	with	East	and	West?	It
is	a	 thinking	process,	you	can	do	 it	anywhere.	 It	has	nothing	 to	do	with	place,
with	geography.	Your	question	is	absurd,	hence	I'm	not	going	to	answer	it.	And
if	I	could	meet	you,	I	would	hit	you."

He	said,	"It	is	good	that	that	examination	was	made	by	me,	because	anybody	else
would	 have	 become	 very	 angry.	 You	 answered	 beautifully	 and	 freshly,	 your
answers	were	simply	answers;	everybody	else	was	quoting	the	text	books.	You
had	 no	 idea	 what	 was	 written	 in	 the	 text	 books,	 you	 have	 never	 seen	 them.
Obviously,	you	had	to	be	original."
An	 old	 professor,	 who	 was	 from	 Poona,	 was	 the	 head	 of	 the	 philosophy
department	of	Allahabad	University,	Professor	R.	D.	Ranade.	He	was	a	world-
famous	authority	on	Indian	philosophy,	and	he	was	also	famous	for	not	passing
anybody.	It	was	said	that	in	his	whole	career	he	had	passed	only	three	persons.
My	professors	were	worried:	"If	Ranade	fails	you,	it	will	be	very	difficult.	Even
if	everybody	else	passes	you,	it	will	not	make	any	difference.
Because	Ranade	is	such	an	authority,	he	carries	more	weight	than	the	three	other
examiners."
But	 he	 gave	 me	 a	 ninety-nine	 percent	 grade,	 and	 wrote	 a	 note	 to	 the	 vice-
chancellor,
"Convey	to	this	student	my	message	that	I	loved	his	answers.	For	the	first	time
in	my	 life	 I	wanted	 to	 give	 a	 one	 hundred	 percent	 score,	 but	 that	would	 have
been	a	little	too	much.	Not	to	look	too	favorable,	I	cut	one	percent.	But	I'm	sorry,
he	deserved	one	hundred	percent	 --	 I	have	always	wanted	answers	so	direct	 to
the	questions,	not	crammed	from	text	books,	and	I	have	always	wanted	answers
as	condensed	as	possible."
I	had	been	warned	that	this	was	what	he	wanted.
I	had	said,	"Don't	be	worried	...	I	can	answer	almost	telegraphically	--	just	one-
liners."
They	 said,	 "You	 are	mad!	We	 are	 not	 saying	 that	 you	 have	 to	 answer	 in	 one
line."
I	said,	"I	will	see."	And	I	answered	with	one-liners.	Within	fifteen	minutes	I	was
finished.
The	professor	who	was	in	charge	in	the	examination	hall	tried	to	force	me	to	stay
seated.
I	 said,	 "This	 is	 strange.	 It	 is	 my	 right	 to	 get	 out	 now	 I'm	 finished	 giving
answers."
He	looked	at	my	answers	and	said,	"My	God,	these	are	answers?	You	are	giving
maxims!"
I	 said,	 "I	want	 to	 test	 Ranade.	 For	 his	whole	 life,	 he	 has	 been	wanting	 short,
simple,	direct	and	original	answers.	Let	him	enjoy	to	his	heart's	content.	It	does
not	matter	whether	 I	 fail	or	pass,	 anyway	 I'm	going	 to	be	a	vagabond.	 I'm	not
going	to	be	in	any	government	service,	I'm	not	going	to	be	doing	any	business.
I'm	going	to	remain	in	the	ancient	business	of	the	buddhas."
They	said,	"You	are	mad.	That's	not	a	business."
I	said,	"Anything	that	keeps	you	busy	is	business."
Ranade	was	very	happy,	but	his	note	shocked	the	vice-chancellor.	And	because
of	Ranade's	ninety-nine	percent	mark,	I	came	first	in	the	whole	university.	Life	is
very	strange,	it	is	a	mystery.
Later	on	I	met	Ranade.	He	was	retired,	very	old.	I	said	to	him,	"Perhaps	you	will
remember	 a	 man	 who	 deserved	 one	 hundred	 percent,	 but	 you	 gave	 him	 only
ninety-nine	percent."
He	said,	"Of	course	I	remember,	because	this	happened	only	once	in	my	life.	I
had	never	gone	beyond	thirty-three	percent.	Are	you	the	person?"
I	said,	"Of	course	I	am	the	person.	And	I	have	come	to	say	to	you	that	you	did
not	 prove	 your	 greatness.	 You	 should	 have	 given	 me	 one	 hundred	 and	 one
percent.	What	was	your	fear?
Were	you	afraid	that	people	would	think	you	were	favoring	me?	You	didn't	even
know	me."
He	said,	"Nobody	talks	to	me	this	way.	I	am	an	old,	retired,	respected	professor."
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	3	-	Unhitch	the	Universe
I	said,	"That	does	not	matter.	You	showed	your	weakness	in	cutting	me	by	one
percent."
He	 said,	 "You	 are	 strange.	 Nobody	 fights	 with	me,	 especially	 after	 ten	 years.
Now	what	can	I	do?"
I	said,	"You	can	at	least	say	'I'm	sorry'."
There	were	at	least	twenty	professors	who	were	sitting	with	him.	He	had	become
almost	 a	 holy	 place,	 where	 every	 kind	 of	 professor	 and	 intellectual	 gathered.
They	were	all	shocked.
I	said,	"Don't	be	worried	about	these	idiots;	it's	because	of	them	you	cut	my	one
percent."
He	looked	at	me	and	he	said,	"I	am	sorry,	and	I	say	it	publicly.	You	deserved	one
hundred	and	one	percent."
I	said	to	him,	"Now	I	can	forgive	you."
I	 was	 speaking	 in	 Allahabad	 University.	 He	 had	 never	 come	 to	 listen	 to	 any
lecturer	 visiting	 the	 university,	 but	 he	 was	 sitting	 just	 in	 front	 of	 me	 when	 I
entered	the	hall.
Everybody	was	 surprised	 that	 Professor	 Ranade	 also	 had	 come	 to	 listen.	 I	 hit
hard	on	the	education	system	and	on	the	professors	who	were	supporting	it.
He	listened	carefully,	and	as	I	came	down	from	the	podium	he	came	to	me	and
said,	"Son"
--	he	was	almost	ninety	years	old	--	"you	are	right.	We	did	not	have	the	courage
to	 fight.	 We	 all	 know	 that	 our	 educational	 system	 is	 producing	 only	 clerks,
secretaries,	 postmasters,	 stationmasters.	 Our	 whole	 education	 is	 based	 on	 the
idea	of	creating	servants.	And	what	you	want	 is	 to	create	masters.	 I	absolutely
agree	with	you."
Zen	wants	everybody	to	be	a	glory	unto	himself.	It	 is	not	an	achievement,	 it	 is
not	competition;	it	is	simply	originality.	And	the	originality	is	already	there,	you
have	 just	 to	 throw	 away	 all	 the	 rubbish	 that	 you	 have	 been	 collecting	 from
others.	 However	 valuable	 it	 may	 be,	 it	 is	 destroying	 your	 original	 being,
covering	it	with	dust;	and	you	will	never	be	happy	unless	you	find	your	original
being.	The	very	finding	of	your	original	being	is	such	a	dance,	such	a	joy,	that
you	can	bless	the	whole	world	yet	you	will	remain	overflowing.
ON	ONE	OCCASION,	RINZAI	SAID:
STUDENTS	OF	TODAY	FAIL	TO	ACHIEVE	THEIR	ENDS.
In	the	first	place,	Rinzai	is	a	great	master	and	cannot	commit	this	mistake.	This
must	be	 the	 translator.	He	must	have	said,	"Disciples	of	 today,"	not	"students."
Students	 go	 to	 the	 universities,	 to	 the	 schools,	 to	 the	 colleges,	 not	 to	 the
monasteries.	 Students	 have	 a	 totally	 different	 interest,	 exactly	 opposite	 to	 the
area	of	Zen.	They	accumulate	knowledge.	Zen	wants	you	to	drop	all	knowledge
so	 that	 you	 can	 become	 utterly	 pure	 and	 innocent,	 so	 that	 you	 can	 say	 with
tremendous	beauty,	"I	don't	know."
Not	knowing,	 just	being,	and	all	 the	mysteries	of	existence	open	their	doors	 to
you.	To	 the	 knowledgeable	 they	 are	 closed,	 to	 the	 innocent	 they	 are	 open.	He
could	not	have	said,	STUDENTS	OF	TODAY;	he	cannot	use	that	phrase.	I	am
absolutely	 certain	 because	 I	 know	 Rinzai,	 and	 whatever	 else	 he	 is	 saying	 is
absolutely	right.
And	 it	 is	 not	 that	 in	 his	 time	 disciples	 FAIL	 TO	 ACHIEVE	 THEIR	 ENDS.
Anybody	who	has	an	end	to	achieve	is	bound	to	fail.	In	the	world	of	Zen	there	is
nothing	to	achieve.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	3	-	Unhitch	the	Universe
Whatever	has	to	happen	has	already	happened,	you	have	just	to	discover	it.	It	is
not	an	achievement.	It	is	not	a	goal	somewhere	far	away,	that	you	have	to	travel
to	that	place.	It	is	just	in	your	very	being,	in	your	very	silence.	You	don't	have	to
achieve	 it.	 It	 is	 a	miracle	 that	you	have	 forgotten	 it	 ...	 in	what	ways	you	have
forgotten	yourself.
All	your	religions	and	all	your	educational	systems	--	the	whole	society	is	bent
upon	 distracting	 every	 small	 child	 from	 his	 original	 being,	 making	 him
something	other	than	what	he	is.	We	have	not	been	able	to	create	a	world	up	to
now	where	a	person	is	accepted	as	he	is,	without	any	conditions.	Not	only	that,
we	have	 created	 such	conditioning	 that	 the	person	himself	 does	not	 accept	his
originality.	 He	 is	 doubtful	 about	 it,	 uncertain	 about	 it,	 hesitant	 about	 it.	 It	 is
better	to	repeat	a	sutra	from	Gautam	Buddha,	because	that	cannot	be	wrong.	To
be	 original	 is	 dangerous	 --	 you	 can	 be	 wrong.	 But	 a	 person	 who	 cannot	 risk
being	wrong	can	never	be	right.
Rinzai's	complaint	is:
WHAT	 IS	 THEIR	 FAULT?	 IT	 LIES	 IN	 NOT	 HAVING	 FAITH	 IN
THEMSELVES.
That	faith	has	been	taken	away	by	the	parents,	by	the	teachers,	by	the	professors,
by	the	priests	--	they	all	have	imposed	the	idea,	"Have	faith	in	Jesus	Christ."	No
Christian	is	being	told	to	have	faith	in	himself,	but	is	told	to	have	faith	in	Jesus
Christ,	to	have	faith	in	his	representatives.
Just	 now	 a	 research	 book	 has	 been	 published,	 explaining	 that	 the	 pope	 is	 the
world's	 greatest	Mafia	 leader.	More	 heroin,	more	 opium,	more	 drugs	 are	 sold
through	the	Vatican	than	through	any	other	place.	All	 the	money	that	comes	to
the	 Vatican	 bank	 --	 the	 pope's	 bank	 --	 is	 heroin	 money.	 But	 his	 is	 a	 special
situation.	 That	 tiny	 area	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 Rome	 is	 an	 independent,	 sovereign
country,	and	the	pope	is	the	head	of	the	state	as	well	as	the	head	of	the	religion.
The	 police	 are	 his,	 the	 Vatican	 armies	 are	 his,	 and	 they	 are	 all	 involved	 in
transactions	which	are	illegal	anywhere.
Just	a	few	months	ago,	the	government	of	Italy	issued	an	arrest	warrant	for	the
manager-in-chief	 of	 the	 bank,	 but	 they	 could	 not	 enter	 into	 the	Vatican.	 They
waited	outside,	 if	 he	 came	outside	he	would	be	 arrested.	Rather	 than	 arresting
him	or	helping	the	Italian	government	to	catch	him	--	because	they	have	found
that	 he	 is	 turning	 dirty	 money	 into	 clean	 money	 by	 the	 millions	 --	 the	 pope
promoted	 him.	And	 now	 it	 has	 been	 found	 that	 the	 pope	 is	 behind	 the	whole
scene.
He	makes	all	those	trips	around	the	world	for	a	stupid	reason:	to	kiss	the	earth.
You	can	kiss	the	earth	anywhere	--	as	much	as	you	want,	to	your	heart's	content;
there	is	no	need	to	waste	millions	of	dollars.	Visiting	Australia,	he	wasted	eight
million	dollars.	What	is	the	purpose?	--	to	kiss	the	ground	at	the	airport.	Where
is	this	money	coming	from?
And	these	are	the	people	...	all	 the	politicians	of	the	world	are	corrupt,	but	just
because	 they	 are	 in	 power	 nobody	 can	 say	 that	 they	 are	 corrupt.	 You	will	 be
crushed.	It	is	almost	impossible	to	be	in	power	and	not	be	corrupted.	Corruption
is	the	force	that	leads	you:	whoever	is	more	corrupt	reaches	the	higher	posts.
Every	child	is	being	destroyed	by	his	own	people.	They	don't	know	consciously
what	 they	 are	 doing.	 Parents	 are	 projecting	 their	 own	 unfulfilled	 desires	 onto
their	children.	The	father	wanted	to	be	a	doctor	but	could	not;	he	ended	up	being
something	else.	He	could	not	pass	the	examinations	and	became	just	a	chemist,
but	 he	 imposes	 the	 desire	 to	 become	 a	 doctor	 onto	 his	 son.	 He	 sends	 him	 to
school	with	great	hope	that	his	child	will	achieve	what	he	could	not	Osho	-	The
Miracle
37
Chapter	3	-	Unhitch	the	Universe
achieve.	He	is	doing	it	all	out	of	his	unconscious	love,	but	unconscious	love	is
not	 love	--	 it	 is	blind.	With	all	good	intentions,	 it	does	harm.	The	child	who	is
being	forced	 to	become	a	doctor,	 if	he	was	 left	alone	 to	grow	according	 to	his
own	 nature	 ...	 one	 never	 knows	 what	 kind	 of	 beauty	 or	 joy,	 what	 kind	 of
individuality,	he	would	have	contributed	to	the	world.
Zen's	whole	approach	is	just	to	be	yourself	--	very	ordinary,	unknown,	unnamed,
but	utterly	content.	To	have	faith	in	yourself	you	don't	need	to	have	faith	in	Jesus
Christ	or	 in	Krishna	or	 in	Moses.	To	have	 faith	 in	yourself	 is	 simple	 --	 just	 to
have	faith	in	yourself.	Know	perfectly	well	that	you	are	moving	into	an	unknown
territory.	 There	may	 be	 dangers	 ahead,	 you	 are	moving	 into	 insecurity,	 but	 to
take	 the	 challenge	 of	 being	 yourself	 makes	 you	 really	 alive.	 And	 when	 you
attain,	 when	 you	 discover	 yourself,	 you	 are	 on	 the	 highest	 peak	 of
consciousness.
The	presidents	and	the	kings	and	the	queens	and	the	prime	ministers	will	never
know	about	 it.	Knowing	it,	being	 it,	 there	comes	a	 tremendous	relaxation.	You
are	 not	 going	 anywhere,	 you	 are	 just	 here.	 You	 have	 been	 always	 here.	 Your
consciousness	is	unpolluted.
Whatever	has	happened	to	you	has	not	left	any	marks	on	your	consciousness.	All
those	marks	are	just	on	the	mind,	and	the	mind	is	not	you.
BY	 LACK	 OF	 FAITH	 YOU	 FALL	 INTO	 A	 STATE	 OF	 UNCERTAINTY	 ...
Obviously	--
if	you	don't	have	faith	in	yourself	you	will	have	to	have	faith	in	somebody	else.
How	can	you	know	that	the	other	is	right?	How	can	you	know	that	Jesus	Christ
is	the	only	begotten	son	of	God?
I	have	often	told	of	a	small	incident	that	happened	in	Bhagdad.	A	man	declared,
"I	 am	 the	 latest	 prophet	 after	Mohammed.	 I	 bring	 the	 latest	 dispensation	 from
God	himself."
Now	 it	 is	 impossible	 for	Mohammedans	 to	 accept	 anybody	 after	Mohammed.
Before	Mohammed	you	can	talk	about	Buddha,	about	Jesus	--	it	doesn't	matter.
But	Mohammed	 is	 the	 last	word.	The	man	was	 caught	 and	brought	before	 the
Khalif	of	Bhagdad.	He	repeated	again,
"Nobody	is	listening	to	me,	but	I	say	unto	you	that	I	am	the	last	prophet!	Now
times	 have	 changed,	 God	 sends	 new	 messengers.	 I	 bring	 the	 latest	 message.
Mohammed	is	out	of	date."
In	fact	he	was	right.	Mohammed	is	out	of	date,	everybody	is	out	of	date.	But	his
insistence	 that	 he	 is	 a	 prophet	 sent	 by	God	 himself	 ...	Mohammedans	 are	 not
very	liberal	or	compassionate	people.	They	don't	believe	in	argument	either,	they
believe	in	the	sword.	That	is	their	only	argument:	whoever	can	cut	off	the	other's
head	is	right.
Naturally	Omar,	 the	Khalif,	 said,	 "Take	 this	man	 and	 put	 him	 in	 jail,	 and	 for
seven	days	give	him	 the	 real	 treatment.	Unless	 he	 confesses	 that	 he	 is	 not	 the
prophet,	 that	Mohammed	is	 the	only	and	 last	prophet,	 torture	him.	After	seven
days	I	will	come	to	visit."
They	 bound	 the	man	 to	 a	 pillar	 and	 for	 seven	 days	 they	 beat	 him;	 blood	was
oozing	out	of	his	every	pore.	He	was	given	no	food	or	water.	After	seven	days
the	Khalif	came	and	asked	 the	man,	"Have	you	changed	your	mind	or	are	you
still	insistent?"
The	man	said,	"When	I	came	here	God's	last	message	was,	'Remember,	you	will
be	beaten,	you	will	be	stoned,	you	may	be	crucified.'	So	all	these	seven	days	you
have	only	been	proving	that	I	am	the	prophet!	Only	prophets	are	treated	in	such
a	way."
Omar	said,	"This	is	a	difficult	case."
Osho	-	The	Miracle
38
Chapter	3	-	Unhitch	the	Universe
At	 this	 moment	 another	 man,	 bound	 to	 another	 pillar,	 who	 had	 been	 tortured
there	for	one	month,	shouted,	"That	man	is	wrong,	Omar.	Don't	believe	him!	I
have	never	sent	anybody	after	Mohammed!	I	have	come	myself."
He	was	God	himself.	He	had	been	jailed	one	month	earlier.
If	you	don't	have	faith	in	yourself,	you	are	going	to	have	faith	in	some	madman
who	proclaims	to	be	God's	messenger	or	God	himself,	or	proclaims	that	he	is	a
reincarnation.	But	 deep	 down	 there	will	 be	 doubt	 --	 how	 can	 you	 believe	 that
that	man	is	not	mad?
Rinzai	is	saying:
BY	LACK	OF	 FAITH	YOU	FALL	 INTO	A	STATE	OF	UNCERTAINTY,	 IN
WHICH
YOU	 CONFORM	 TO	 ALL	 THE	 FLUCTUATIONS	 IN	 YOUR
SURROUNDINGS,	 SUBJECTING	 YOURSELF	 TO	 THEIR	 MYRIAD
REVOLUTIONS,	SO	THAT	YOU	ARE
UNABLE	 TO	 ACHIEVE	 FREEDOM.	 IF	 YOU,	 HOWEVER,	 SUCCEED	 IN
STOPPING
THE	MIND,	AS	IT	MOMENTARILY	DASHES	HITHER	AND	THITHER	IN
ITS
SEARCH,	 YOU	 THEN	 BECOME	 INDISTINGUISHABLE	 FROM	 THE
PATRIARCHS
AND	BUDDHAS.
Patriarchs	are	equivalent	to	the	master,	founders	of	some	school	of	Zen.
When	your	mind	 is	silent	and	all	 the	vibrations	of	 thoughts	are	no	more	 there,
you	are	one	with	the	buddhas	and	with	the	masters.	There	is	nothing	to	divide.	In
this	 position	 sometimes	 even	 the	 sanest	 men	 have	 declared	 that	 they	 are	 the
buddha,	 that	 they	 are	God,	 but	 this	 is	 a	 totally	 different	 situation.	 A	madman
shows	every	sign	of	madness,	he	does	not	radiate	buddhahood.	He	does	not	have
the	fragrance	of	those	heights,	nor	can	you	see	in	his	eyes	the	pacific	depths.
There	are	moments	 in	meditation	when	you	are	a	buddha.	The	only	distinction
between	 a	 madman	 and	 the	 man	 who	 is	 a	 real	 buddha	 is	 that	 the	 buddha	 is
compassionate,	 loving,	and	 is	not	declaring	 that	he	 is	 the	only	begotten	son	of
God.	He	is	saying,	"I	am	a	buddha	and	you	are	a	buddha,	whether	you	know	it	or
not."	 The	 madman	 declares,	 "I	 am	 the	 only	 buddha	 --	 you	 are	 just	 ordinary
human	beings,	made	of	mud.	God	breathed	in	you	and	you	started	running	hither
and	thither."
The	English	word	 'Adam'	means	mud.	God	made	man	out	of	mud.	In	America
we	had	our	commune,	Rancho	Rajneesh.	Before	we	went	there	it	was	called	the
Big	Muddy	Ranch.	I	always	wondered,	perhaps	God	took	all	the	mud	from	this
Big	 Muddy	 Ranch	 and	 created	 humanity.	 There	 wasn't	 any	 mud	 at	 that	 Big
Muddy	Ranch,	it	was	a	desert.	And	certainly	it	was	big,	one	hundred	and	twenty-
six	square	miles.
All	the	words	...	for	example	'human	being'	--	'human'	comes	from	'humus',	and
'humus'
means	mud.	Religions	have	degraded	man	 into	puppets,	made	of	mud.	That	 is
the	distinction
--	 the	madman	who	 is	 declaring	 himself	 as	 the	 prophet	 or	 the	messiah	 or	 the
Christ	does	not	say	that	you	are	also	Christ.	He	wants	to	be	special,	that	is	a	sure
sign	of	madness.
A	buddha	is	absolute	sanity.	He	knows	that	he	is	a	buddha	and	he	knows	you	are
also	a	buddha.	You	are	just	asleep.	Perhaps	you	have	not	decided	yet	to	wake	up,
but	it	is	your	freedom	to	do	so.
Do	you	see	the	difference?	The	madman	wants	to	be	special;	the	buddha	is	not
special.	 He	 is	 declaring	 the	 buddhahood	 of	 every	 living	 thing	 --	 not	 only	 of
human	beings,	but	even	of	Osho	-	The	Miracle
39
Chapter	3	-	Unhitch	the	Universe
pine	trees	and	rosebushes.	They	are	on	the	way	to	buddhahood;	sooner	or	later
they	will	 also	 be	 human	 beings.	But	whether	 they	 know	 it	 or	 not,	 it	 does	 not
matter.	As	far	as	their	innermost	nature	is	concerned,	it	remains	the	same.
The	difference	between	 the	buddha	and	 the	 rest	of	existence	 is	 simply	 that	 the
buddha	 has	 awakened	 to	 his	 reality.	 So	 the	 buddha	 is	 continuously	 trying	 to
wake	 you	 up;	 creating	 devices,	methods,	 knowing	 perfectly	 well	 that	 you	 are
asleep,	 that	 you	 only	 need	 some	 cold	 water	 thrown	 into	 your	 eyes.	 But	 the
madman	does	not	believe	that	you	are	also	a	buddha.
Jesus	Christ	belongs	to	the	category	of	madmen,	because	of	his	statement	that	he
is	the	only	begotten	son	of	God,	and	you	are	just	sheep.	He	is	your	shepherd;	he
will	lead	you	and,	if	he	is	leading	you,	you	are	on	the	right	path	--	have	faith	in
him!	If	you	go	astray	you	will	be	lost.	In	fact	he	is	saying,	"Don't	have	faith	in
yourself.	Give	your	faith	to	me,	I	am	the	only	one	who	is	connected	directly	with
God.	Have	trust	in	me."	No	buddha	will	say	that.
In	 the	 eyes	of	 a	 buddha	 this	 is	 sheer	 nonsense.	This	 is	 the	difference	between
Christianity,	 Hinduism,	 Jainism,	 Mohammedanism	 --	 all	 the	 religions	 of	 the
world	on	one	side	--	and	Zen,	standing	alone,	in	utter	sanity.	Zen	says	that	you
all	have	the	universal	consciousness.	Nobody	is	special.	A	few	people	are	asleep
and	a	few	people	are	awake,	there	is	not	much	of	a	difference.
DO	 YOU	 WANT	 TO	 KNOW	 WHO	 ARE	 THE	 PATRIARCHS	 AND
BUDDHAS?	ALL
OF	YOU	LISTENING	TO	MY	TEACHING	HERE	BEFORE	ME	ARE	SUCH.
I	can	accept	Rinzai	as	an	authentic	master.	He	knows	what	he	is	saying,	because
he	is	not	putting	himself	over	others.	He	is	just	saying	that	we	are	all	part	of	one
consciousness.
YOU	 FOLLOWERS	 OF	 THE	 WAY,	 THERE	 IS	 NO	 NEED	 FOR	 YOU	 TO
DEVOTE
EFFORT	 TO	 THE	 BUDDHIST	 TEACHING.	 ONLY	 DO	 THE	 ORDINARY
THINGS	WITH
NO	SPECIAL	EFFORT:	RELIEVE	YOUR	BOWELS,	PASS	WATER,	WEAR
YOUR
CLOTHES,	 EAT	 YOUR	 FOOD,	 AND,	 WHEN	 TIRED,	 LIE	 DOWN.	 THE
SIMPLE
FELLOW	WILL	LAUGH	AT	YOU,	BUT	THE	WISE	WILL	UNDERSTAND.
AN	 ANCIENT	 SAID:	 "ALL	 THOSE	 WHO	 STRIVE	 OUTWARDLY	 ARE
STUPID."
The	very	 idea	of	becoming	a	buddha	 is	stupid,	because	you	are	a	buddha.	The
question	is	of	waking	up,	not	of	becoming.
SUFFICE	 IT	 TO	 BE	 ONE'S	 OWN	 MASTER	 WHEREVER	 ONE	 MAY
HAPPEN	TO
BE,	 AND	 REALITY	 WILL	 PREVAIL	 EVERYWHERE.	 THUS	 ONE	 WILL
REMAIN
UNSHAKEN	UNDER	ALL	CIRCUMSTANCES.
RINZAI	SAID	ON	ANOTHER	OCCASION:
IN	 YOUR	 RED	 HEART,	 THERE	 IS	 A	 TRUE	 MAN	 OF	 NO	 FIXED
POSITION,	WHO
COMES	 IN	 AND	 GOES	 OUT	 THROUGH	 YOUR	 FOREHEAD.	 I	 URGE
THOSE	WHO
HAVE	NOT	EXPERIENCED	THIS,	TO	TRY	TO	SEE	IT.
A	 footnote:	 "In	 China,	 the	 heart	 is	 believed	 to	 be	 the	 seat	 of	 thought,	 or
intelligence,	and	its	western	equivalent	is	mind.	A	TRUE	MAN	OF	NO	FIXED
POSITION	 is	 the	mind	which,	 according	 to	Huang	Po,	 also	known	as	Obaku,
has	neither	location	nor	direction	because	it	is	as	immense	as	space."
This	footnote	must	be	from	the	translator.	The	red	heart	does	not	mean	the	mind.
In	 Zen	 tradition	 the	 red	 heart	 is	 simply	 the	 one	 that	 the	 physician	 and	 the
physiologist	know,	the	one	Osho	-	The	Miracle
40
Chapter	3	-	Unhitch	the	Universe
that	 is	 running	 the	body.	That	heart	 is	 the	center	of	 the	body.	To	complete	 the
distinction,	behind	this	heart	there	is	another	heart	which	in	China	they	used	to
call	the	"inner	heart."
In	India	just	a	few	years	ago,	there	was	a	man,	Brahmayogi,	who	had	practiced
for	almost	half	a	century	to	bring	his	breathing	to	a	complete	stop.	His	heartbeat
disappeared,	his	pulse	disappeared.	He	was	capable	of	remaining	in	this	position
for	 ten	 minutes.	 He	 had	 been	 tested	 at	 many	 medical	 institutes,	 and	 doctors
around	 the	world	 had	 given	 him	 a	 death	 certificate.	 In	 those	 ten	minutes	 they
could	not	find	any	sign	of	life.	It	was	his	agreement	that	he	would	go	out	of	the
body,	and,	"If	you	find	no	sign	of	life,	you	have	to	write	a	certificate	for	me	just
the	way	you	would	for	any	dead	person."
They	 could	 not	 believe	 that	 this	 man	 could	 come	 back.	 He	 had	 gone	 too	 far
away:	no	pulse,	no	heartbeat,	no	breathing.	He	was	examined	with	very	accurate
instruments,	but	there	was	no	sign	of	life.	Yet	after	ten	minutes	he	started	kicking
again.	Slowly	breathing	came	back,	the	heart	started	functioning	again,	the	blood
started	running.	These	doctors	could	not	believe	it,	but	 they	had	to	believe.	He
was	given	many	hundreds	of	death	certificates,	no	man	in	the	world	got	so	many
death	certificates,	and	from	very	prominent	people.	Ordinarily	one	is	enough!
Obviously	he	proved	beyond	doubt	that	what	you	call	death	is	not	real.	Only	his
outer	 heart	 stopped.	 The	 inner	 heart,	 which	 you	 have	 not	 found	 yet,	 has	 the
capacity	 to	 go	 out	 of	 the	 body.	 Sometimes	 accidentally,	 in	 deep	 hypnosis,	 it
happens	that	you	suddenly	find	yourself	floating	above	your	body.	Your	body	is
lying	 down	on	 the	 floor,	 and	 you	 can	 see	 your	 hypnotist	 sitting	 there	 by	 your
dead	body.
If	a	certain	doubt	arises	in	this	moment,	then	death	will	happen.	But	if	you	are
under	hypnosis,	doubt	cannot	arise.	You	have	trusted	the	man	to	hypnotize	you,
and	because	doubt	does	not	arise,	when	 the	man	calls	you	 to	come	back,	your
body	--	the	astral	body,	the	inner	body,	the	self	--	slowly	comes	down	and	enters
into	your	physical	body.
It	is	a	tremendously	beautiful	experience,	but	dangerous	too.	If	somebody	tries	to
wake	 you	 up	 while	 you	 are	 out,	 he	 will	 think	 that	 you	 are	 dead	 and	 start
preparing	 for	 the	 funeral.	 If	you	become	afraid	you	may	 forget	how	you	came
out;	 then	 how	 to	 get	 back?	 Coming	 in	 and	 out	 of	 the	 body	 is	 not	 part	 of
knowledge,	it	is	not	a	technique.	Yes,	if	you	make	it	a	point	to	practice	it,	it	can
become	possible	for	you	to	come	out	of	the	body	and	return	whenever	you	want,
but	not	ordinarily.	Sometimes	in	a	car	accident	your	inner	self	is	so	much	shaken
that	it	leaves	the	body.	But	because	of	your	desires	you	are	attached	to	the	body,
and	you	will	be	pulled	back	into	it.
If	a	meditator	who	is	finished	completely	with	all	desires	is	in	such	an	accident,
he	may	not	return	to	the	body	at	all.	Everybody	will	 think	it	was	an	accidental
death,	but	it	was	not	accidental,	it	was	very	intentional.	The	person	decided	not
to	return.	But	nobody	can	catch	hold	of	him	to	take	him	to	the	court.
Here	 in	 this	Buddha	Hall	 it	may	happen	many	 times,	but	don't	 talk	about	 it	 to
anybody.	If	you	feel	sometimes	that	you	are	hovering,	don't	be	worried.	Just	one
hit	of	Nivedano's	drum	and	you	will	jump	back	into	your	body.	That's	why	it's	so
safe	to	tell	you	to	die,	because	I	know	you	cannot	go	far	away	in	two	minutes.
You	will	be	just	here,	hovering.	Just	a	good	drumbeat	and	you	will	hurry	back,
"Everybody	is	coming	back,	what	am	I	doing	out	here?	My	body	is	 there."	Be
quick,	because	somebody	else	may	enter.
That	is	the	only	problem	I	have	to	keep	watching	for	--	that	nobody	enters	into
somebody	else's	body.	So	if	some	day	you	feel	like	floating,	then	float,	but	stay
close	by.	Don't	go	out	for	Osho	-	The	Miracle
41
Chapter	3	-	Unhitch	the	Universe
an	evening	walk,	just	to	see	what	is	happening	outside	the	gate	--	that	could	be
dangerous.	By	 the	 time	you	come	back	somebody	else	may	have	entered.	You
can	also	enter,	but	it	is	a	very	difficult	situation	when	there	are	two	spirits	in	one
body.
Once	in	a	while	those	cases	happen,	then	you	say	the	person	is	possessed	by	a
ghost.	But	the	reality	is	that	the	ghost	lost	track	of	his	body	after	some	incident,
or	does	not	know	how	he	came	out	of	his	body.
My	first	experience	out	of	 the	body	was	falling	from	a	 tree.	I	used	to	meditate
just	behind	the	university,	where	there	was	a	beautiful	hillock	and	three	tall	trees,
very	 silent,	 and	 nobody	 used	 to	 go	 there.	 I	 used	 to	 sit	 in	 one	 of	 the	 trees	 and
meditate.	One	day	suddenly	I	saw	that	I	was	sitting	in	the	tree	and	at	the	same
time	my	body	had	 fallen	 down	 and	was	 lying	 on	 the	 ground.	For	 a	moment	 I
could	not	find	how	to	enter	into	it	again.	It	was	just	a	coincidence	that	a	woman
who	used	to	bring	milk	to	the	university	from	the	nearby	village	saw	my	body
falling	down,	so	she	came	close.	She	must	have	heard	that	in	situations	when	the
inner	body	becomes	separated	from	the	outer	body,	if	you	rub	between	the	eyes,
the	third	eye,	that	is	the	door.	The	spirit	that	has	left	will	be	able	to	enter.
So	she	rubbed	my	third	eye.	I	could	see	her	rubbing	my	forehead,	and	the	next
moment	I	opened	my	eyes	and	thanked	her	and	asked	her	how	she	knew	to	do
that.
She	had	simply	heard	about	it.	It	was	a	primitive	village,	but	she	had	heard	the
traditional	idea	that	the	third	eye	is	the	place	from	where	one	leaves	and	where
one	can	come	back.
IN	 YOUR	 RED	 HEART,	 THERE	 IS	 A	 TRUE	 MAN	 OF	 NO	 FIXED
POSITION,	WHO
COMES	IN	AND	GOES	OUT	THROUGH	YOUR	FOREHEAD.
That	place	in	the	forehead	is	called	in	yoga	the	third	eye.
I	URGE	THOSE	WHO	HAVE	NOT	EXPERIENCED	THIS,	TO	TRY	TO	SEE
IT.
Rinzai	 is	 saying	 it	 is	 a	 tremendously	 significant	 experience,	 because	 then	 no
argument	is	needed	for	you	to	be	convinced	that	you	are	not	this	body	--	that	you
are	astral,	invisible.
Within	 this	 body	 is	 hiding	 another	 body;	 behind	 this	 heart	 is	 beating	 another
heart,	which	medical	 science	may	 one	 day	 discover.	The	mystics	 have	 always
insisted	it	is	there.	It	is	in	your	hands	if	you	want	to	experiment.
Just	meditating,	 feel	 your	body	 lying	 there.	Feel	 that	 from	your	 forehead	your
spirit	 is	 moving	 up,	 hovering	 in	 the	 air;	 but	 don't	 go	 too	 far.	 And	 always
remember	the	forehead,	the	third	eye,	is	the	door	through	which	you	go	out	and
come	 back	 in.	 This	 experience	 creates	 a	 conviction.	 Then	 it	 is	 no	more	 faith.
Then	you	know	that	you	are	immortal,	that	this	body	is	just	a	bag,	a	cage.

Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
I	IMAGINED	THAT	OUR	TENDENCY	TO	PUT	OURSELVES	DOWN	WAS
A	 PRODUCT	 OF	 OUR	 CONDITIONING,	 AND	 SOMETHING	 PECULIAR
TO	MODERN
MAN.	BUT	EVEN	IN	RINZAI'S	TIME	IT	APPEARS	THAT	WAS	THE	CHIEF
OBSTACLE	TO	SELF-REALIZATION	TOO.
CAN	 A	 SOCIETY	 OF	 UNENLIGHTENED	 PEOPLE	 EXIST	 ONLY	 IF
EVERYBODY	IS
MADE	TO	FEEL	INADEQUATE?
Osho	-	The	Miracle
43
Chapter	3	-	Unhitch	the	Universe
Yes,	 Maneesha.	 This	 kind	 of	 society	 can	 exist	 only	 if	 it	 makes	 you	 feel
inadequate.	This	kind	of	society,	 the	structure,	needs	people	who	are	suffering,
or	made	to	suffer,	from	inferiority,	who	deep	down	are	carrying	a	conditioning
that	they	are	unworthy,	undeserving.
This	kind	of	society	can	exist	only	 if	 it	makes	every	child	 inadequate,	because
this	 society	 needs	 exploitation,	 this	 society	 has	 invested	 itself	 in	 exploiting
human	beings.	It	does	not	and	it	cannot	allow	everybody	to	be	himself,	because
if	everybody	is	himself	there	cannot	be	any	religious	organization	to	exploit	you
--	 no	 Christianity,	 no	 pope,	 no	 kings	 or	 queens,	 no	 leaders.	 Because	 then	 an
individual	is	enough	unto	himself,	he	does	not	need	any	leader.
All	these	so-called	great	people	--	politicians,	priests	--	exist	because	every	child
has	 been	 crippled,	 has	 not	 been	 allowed	 to	 become	 an	 individual	 in	 his	 own
right.	 Otherwise	 he	 will	 not	 follow	 anybody.	 He	 will	 follow	 himself,	 he	 will
move	in	directions	which	are	of	his	own	choosing.	He	will	not	need	any	guide
and	will	not	need	any	map	and	will	not	need	any	dictators.	This	kind	of	society
can	exist	only	if	the	children	en	masse	are	forced	to	feel	inadequate.
And	 my	 effort	 here	 is	 to	 give	 you	 your	 forgotten	 dignity.	 This	 is	 the	 most
revolutionary	 step,	 because	 if	 you	 can	 remember	 your	 forgotten	 dignity,	 your
spirituality,	your	eternity,	you	will	be	 freed	 from	all	 the	churches,	 from	all	 the
nations.	You	will	be	freed	from	all	kinds	of	stupid	ideologies	and	superstitions.
Your	 consciousness	 will	 be	 such	 an	 explosion	 of	 light	 that	 everything	 that	 is
false	will	disappear.
Then	this	explosion	creates	a	chain	reaction	--	and	that	is	my	effort.	It	is	possible
to	make	a	chain	reaction.
I	am	making	every	effort	to	have	small	groups	of	sannyasins	radiating	in	every
country.
The	whole	world	can	be	 transformed	 if	we	have	 just	a	 few	people	everywhere
who	can	become	aflame.	Then	their	flame	will	move	like	a	wildfire,	destroying
all	kinds	of	slaveries	and	all	kinds	of	chains	and	imprisonments	--	creating	a	new
sky,	a	new	freedom	for	man.
You	are	 right.	 In	Rinzai's	 time	 also	 the	 same	was	 the	 case.	The	whole	 past	 of
humanity	is	a	past	of	psychological	slavery,	physical	slavery.	Only	a	few	people
like	Gautam	Buddha	or	Rinzai	or	Basho,	in	thousands	of	years	amongst	millions
of	people,	have	been	able	to	escape	from	psychological	bondage.	These	people
were	always	thought	dangerous	by	the	society.
Now	 so	 many	 parliaments	 in	 the	 world,	 without	 ever	 defining	 what	 kind	 of
danger	I	am,	have	an	unconscious	feeling	that	this	man	is	dangerous	and	should
not	be	allowed	in	 their	country.	They	don't	know	exactly	what	danger	 they	are
talking	 about.	 I	 am	 utterly	 amazed	 that	 in	 these	 big	 parliaments	 not	 a	 single
person	raises	the	question,	"What	danger	do	you	mean?
What	danger	 is	 this	man	 to	 anyone?"	No,	 it	 is	 simply	accepted.	 It	 is	 taken	 for
granted	that,
"This	man	is	dangerous."
But	I	know	they	are	right.	They	are	calling	me	dangerous	without	knowing	it.	I
call	myself	dangerous	because	I	know	I	am	dangerous.	I	am	preparing	a	situation
far	more	dangerous	to	the	whole	society	than	the	nuclear	scientists	are	creating.
Their	 nuclear	weapons	most	 probably	will	 never	 be	 used;	 sooner	 or	 later	 they
will	 be	 thrown	 into	 the	 ocean.	 But	 I	 am	 creating	 a	 totally	 different	 kind	 of
explosion	--	not	an	atomic	explosion,	but	an	explosion	of	cosmic	consciousness.
If	 this	 fire	 spreads,	 suddenly	 you	 will	 see	 that	 those	 great	 leaders	 are	 just
ordinary	people,	just	like	you,	but	pretenders,	imposters.	You	will	see	that	your
kings	 and	 queens	 are	 all	 bogus,	 exploiting	 the	 society	 for	 thousands	 of	 years.
You	will	see	that	your	priests	are	lying	and	lying	continuously	about	everything.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	3	-	Unhitch	the	Universe
This	vision,	if	it	spreads,	is	bound	to	create	a	new	man	and	a	new	society.
A	new	man	can	only	be	an	enlightened	man.
A	new	man	can	only	be	a	buddha.
And	if	there	are	just	a	few	buddhas	around	the	world,	we	can	create	the	wildfire.
It	has	never	been	 tried,	but	 it	 is	 just	 like	 ...	nobody	knew	about	atomic	energy
until	it	was	tried	at	Hiroshima	and	Nagasaki.	Nobody	could	imagine	that	a	small
atom	that	you	cannot	see	is	carrying	so	much	energy	that	it	can	destroy	a	great
city	 like	 Nagasaki,	 with	 a	 population	 of	 one	 hundred	 thousand	 people,	 or
Hiroshima,	an	even	bigger	city.	In	the	whole	of	history	nobody	ever	dreamt	that
atoms	are	carrying	so	much	energy.
Now	I	am	saying	to	you	that	if	material	atoms	can	explode	and	destroy	so	much
...	how	much	more	creative	a	conscious	explosion	of	living	beings	can	be.	It	can
explode	millions	of	people	suddenly	into	a	new	era	of	enlightenment.
All	 their	 potentialities	 should	 become	 actualities.	 You	 will	 see	 thousands	 of
poets,	you	will	see	thousands	of	musicians,	you	will	see	thousands	of	sculptors,
thousands	 of	 scientists	 who	 were	 fast	 asleep	 and	 were	 just	 clerks	 or
schoolmasters	--	who	never	knew	that	their	potential	is	that	of	a	buddha.

Maneesha,	 obviously	 these	 statements	 of	 Dogen	 were	 uttered	 before	 his
enlightenment.	He	is	a	beautiful	scholar,	a	learned	man.	He	has	a	rare	intellect;
from	the	age	of	seven	he	was	able	to	translate	Buddha's	words	from	Chinese	to
Japanese.	At	the	age	of	four	he	was	able	to	learn	Chinese.	He	was	a	rare	child,	a
rare	 intellect,	a	genius.	But	 that	 is	a	barrier	as	far	as	Zen	 is	concerned.	 It	must
have	been	a	difficult	time	for	him	to	later	change	gears	from	mind	to	heart.
These	sutras	are	just	from	the	mind.	Whoever	has	compiled	these	sutras	does	not
know	that	a	master	does	not	speak	the	way	Dogen	is	speaking.	This	is	the	way	of
the	scholar.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	4	-	This	harvest	moon
I	have	to	remind	you	that	at	some	point	Dogen	must	have	become	a	master.	We
have	discussed	the	sutras	written	when	he	had	become	enlightened.	It	is	a	good
comparison	 ...	 to	 see	 in	 a	 single	man	what	 enlightenment	 brings	 and	what	 the
impediments	 are.	 Even	 to	 a	 man	 like	 Dogen	 with	 such	 immense	 and	 unique
intelligence	 ...	 the	problem	arises	 that	his	 intelligence	 is	so	great	 that	 it	 is	very
difficult	to	take	the	jump	out	of	it.
Sometimes	things	which	are	blissful,	fortunate,	become	unfortunate,	dangerously
preventing	the	quantum	leap.	You	can	see	why	I	call	him	still	a	scholar.
DOGEN	WROTE:	QUIETLY	CONSIDER	...
What	 is	 consideration?	 It	 cannot	 be	 meditation.	 There	 is	 no	 place	 for
consideration	 in	 meditation.	 Consideration	 is	 of	 the	 mind,	 consideration	 is
another	 name	 for	 thinking.	 And	 how	 can	 you	 consider	 something	 which	 you
don't	know?
Just	the	fact	that	he	is	asking,
QUIETLY	 CONSIDER	 THE	 FACT	 THAT	 IF	 THIS	WERE	 A	 TIME	WHEN
THE	TRUE
DHARMA	 HAS	 NOT	 YET	 SPREAD	 THROUGHOUT	 THE	 WORLD,	 IT
WOULD	BE
IMPOSSIBLE	FOR	US	TO	COME	INTO	CONTACT	WITH	IT.
Sheer	nonsense.	If	Gautam	Buddha	could	become	a	buddha	when	there	were	no
precedents,	 then	 what	 is	 the	 problem	 for	 you	 to	 become	 a	 buddha?	Whether
Buddha	 existed	 or	 not	 --	 he	may	be	 a	myth,	 a	 fiction,	 it	makes	 no	 difference,
because	 it	 is	 not	Gautam	Buddha	 that	 has	 to	 be	 taken	 into	 consideration.	 It	 is
your	own	being	which	I	am	calling	the	buddha.
And	 your	 own	 being	 is	 always	with	 you,	whether	Buddha	 has	 existed	 or	 not,
whether	so	many	enlightened	people	on	his	path	have	existed	or	not.
I	don't	have	a	master,	I	don't	know	Chinese.	I	don't	know	Japanese,	in	which	the
original	Zen	teachings	are	written,	and	I	don't	care!	In	fact,	listening	to	me,	if	the
scholars	 see	 that	 I	 am	 saying	 something	different	 from	what	 is	 in	 their	 books,
then	they	should	change	their	books,	correct	their	books.
It	happened	 ...	Bhikkshu	Anand	Kausalyayan	has	 just	died.	He	was	one	of	 the
most	prominent	Buddhists	of	the	contemporary	world.	I	used	to	stay	in	Nagpur
in	 a	 friend's	 house	 when	 I	 was	 traveling	 around	 India,	 and	 that	 friend	 was
intimate	 with	 Bhikkshu	 Anand	 Kausalyayan.	 He	 said	 to	 me,	 "Anand
Kausalyayan	wants	to	meet	you.	I	have	talked	about	you	so	many	times,	and	he
has	also	heard	about	you."
I	said,	"I	will	be	very	happy	to	meet	him.	I	have	read	his	books.	You	bring	him	to
your	home."
So	 that	 evening	 Anand	 Kausalyayan	 came	 to	 see	 me	 and	 it	 became	 a	 Zen
encounter.	I	had	to,	because	the	first	thing	I	asked	him	was,	"Are	you	a	Buddhist
or	a	buddha?"
He	 looked	 at	 the	 host	 with	 whom	 I	 was	 staying,	 and	 I	 could	 see	 that	 he
understood,	but	he	was	caught	in	a	net.	I	was	staring	into	his	eyes,	so	he	could
not	lie!	He	said,	"I	am	sorry,	I	am	still	a	Buddhist."
I	said,	"What	is	the	point	of	being	a	Buddhist?	You	are	getting	older	every	day.
Any	moment	death	will	take	you	away,	and	your	Buddhism	will	not	help.	Why
don't	you	become	a	buddha?"
He	said,	"My	God,	I	had	come	to	see	you	to	have	a	polite	conversation."
Osho	-	The	Miracle
51
Chapter	4	-	This	harvest	moon
I	said,	"With	me	nothing	is	polite,	either	this	way	or	that	way.	If	you	are	not	a
buddha,	 then	 how	 is	 a	 conversation	 possible?	 I	 am	 a	 buddha,	 you	 are	 a	mere
scholar."
He	 said,	 "That	 seems	 to	 be	 true.	 When	 I	 heard	 you	 for	 the	 first	 time	 in	 a
Buddhist	conference	in	Bodhgaya	you	told	a	story.	I	loved	the	story,	but	I	have
been	searching	in	Buddhist	scriptures	--	that	story	is	not	there!	Now	almost	five
years	 have	 passed	 and	 I	 am	 still	 looking	 in	 every	 nook	 and	 corner,	 because
Buddhism	has	many	scriptures	...	maybe	somewhere	that	story	is.	But	there	is	no
trace."
I	 said,	 "You	are	doing	a	wrong	 thing!	You	 just	write	 the	 story	down	 in	any	of
your	scriptures.	A	buddha	himself	is	speaking.	And	you	can	at	least	understand
that	 that	 kind	 of	 story	 can	 happen	 only	 to	 a	 buddha.	 So	 it	 does	 not	 matter
whether	it	happened	to	Gautam	Buddha	or	to	some	other	buddha,	the	taste	of	it	is
just	like	the	ocean	--	taste	it	anywhere	and	it	is	the	same.	Don't	be	bothered	about
who	is	telling	the	story,	don't	be	bothered	about	the	bamboo	from	which	the	song
is	flowing.	It	is	not	the	bamboo	but	the	hollowness	of	the	bamboo	that	allows	the
singer	to	sing.
"Meditation	 makes	 you	 a	 hollow	 bamboo	 and	 the	 same	 universal	 spirit	 starts
singing	 through	 you.	 So	 don't	 bother	 with	 unnecessarily	 looking	 into	 dead
scriptures,	write	it	down	here,	now,	and	add	it	to	any	Buddhist	scripture."
He	 said,	 "That	 is	 very	 difficult.	 Nothing	 can	 be	 added,	 that	 would	 be	 very
unholy."
I	said,	"Do	you	like	the	story?"
He	said,	"I	immensely	like	it."
I	said,	"Do	you	think	anybody	who	is	not	a	buddha	can	manage	that	story?"
He	said,	"No,	I	don't	think	so."
"Then,"	 I	 said,	 "be	 a	 little	 courageous.	 Scholars	 are	 always	 just	 like	mice,	 no
courage	at	all.
Be	a	lion!"
The	 story	 was	 a	 simple	 story	 I	 have	 told	 you	 many	 times,	 and	 I	 don't	 care
whether	it	happened	or	not.	It	makes	sense,	it	makes	you	understand	something
of	 the	 inexpressible,	 that	 is	 justification	enough.	 If	 it	did	not	happen,	 it	 should
have	happened.	 If	 I	 ever	meet	Gautam	Buddha	 I	will	 force	 him	 to	 correct	 the
omission.
Anand	Kausalyayan	said,	"I	have	another	appointment."
I	said,	"I	know	you	must	have	another	appointment,	that	our	conversation	is	not
going	 to	happen.	But	 remember	 that	all	your	 scholarship	and	all	your	 fame	all
over	 Asia,	 wherever	 Buddhism	 prevails,	 is	 worth	 nothing,	 because	 you	 don't
have	 the	 courage	 to	 be	 a	 buddha.	 And	 being	 a	 buddha	 is	 not	 somebody's
monopoly.	Being	a	buddha	is	not	being	a	Buddhist.	A	Buddhist	is	a	follower,	a
buddha	knows.	A	buddha	has	no	need	to	follow	anybody."
The	 story	 was	 that	 Gautam	 Buddha	 and	 Ananda,	 his	 disciple,	 were	 passing
through	a	 forest.	They	had	 just	crossed	a	small	 stream.	Buddha	 is	an	old	man,
and	he	says	to	Ananda,	"I	am	feeling	very	thirsty,	you	just	go	back	and	from	that
stream	bring	me	some	water	in	my	bowl."
Ananda	 took	 the	bowl	and	went	back.	But	meanwhile	 a	 few	bullock	carts	had
passed	through	the	stream	and	had	disturbed	its	water	completely;	it	had	become
muddy.	Dead	 leaves	which	were	 silently	 asleep	on	 the	bottom	had	 surfaced	 to
have	another	look	at	the	world.	The	Osho	-	The	Miracle
52
Chapter	4	-	This	harvest	moon
water	was	not	drinkable,	and	Ananda	was	in	a	difficulty:	what	to	do?	This	water
he	cannot	take	for	his	master.	So	he	went	back.	Buddha	was	sitting	under	a	tree
and	asked,	"Have	you	brought	the	water?"
He	told	what	happened.	Buddha	said,	"You	are	stupid.	You	just	go	there	and	sit
by	 the	 side	 of	 the	 stream.	When	we	 came	 it	was	 not	muddy.	The	 dead	 leaves
were	asleep	on	the	bottom,	the	water	was	crystal	clear.	So	just	go	there	and	wait,
it	 needs	 only	 patience.	 Soon	 the	 leaves	 will	 be	 gone;	 because	 the	 stream	 is
flowing,	they	cannot	stay	there.	The	dirt	will	settle	--
gravitation	is	continuously	pulling	everything	towards	itself.	Everything	is	being
done,	soon	the	water	will	be	clear."
Ananda	did	not	want	to	go,	because	he	had	seen	that	it	had	become	so	dirty	that
it	 would	 take	 days	 to	 have	 that	 same	 crystal-clear	 quality	 that	 Buddha
remembered.
He	said,	"Don't	be	worried.	I	will	bring	water,	but	I	will	have	to	go	in	the	other
direction.
Ahead	there	is	a	big	river.	It	will	take	a	little	longer	time,	because	it	must	be	four
miles	from	here,	but	it	will	be	fresh	water,	drinkable	water.	You	rest	here."
Buddha	insisted,	"Don't	change	your	mind,	just	go	back."	And	when	the	master
says,	"Just	go	back	..."	Unwillingly,	deep	down	resisting,	Ananda	went	back	and
was	surprised	and	shocked	that	meanwhile	the	leaves	had	gone	and	the	dirt	had
settled.	He	had	not	even	to	wait,	the	water	was	as	crystal-clear	as	it	was	before!
All	that	was	foreign	--	the	dirt,	the	dead	leaves
--	had	all	gone.	The	water	had	come	to	its	purity.	He	filled	the	begging	bowl	of
Gautam	Buddha.
But	insistently	he	was	aware	of	the	question,	"Why	was	Buddha	so	adamant	that
I	have	to	come	back	here	to	bring	water?	He	needs	water	...	I	could	have	brought
it	from	another	stream.	Why	this	stream?	There	must	be	some	reason."
And	as	he	came	back	towards	Buddha	the	reason	became	clear.	Just	as	the	leaves
and	 the	 dirt,	which	 are	 not	 natural	 to	 the	 stream	 --	which	 are	 foreign	 visitors,
tourists	 --	 are	 bound	 to	 leave	 sooner	 or	 later	 ...	 Suddenly	 he	 realized	 what
Buddha	 meant	 --	 that	 your	 thoughts,	 your	 emotions,	 your	 sentiments,	 all	 are
foreign	to	your	buddha	nature.	If	you	just	wait	patiently	they	all	will	disappear
without	any	effort	on	your	side.	Your	purity	will	assert	itself	on	its	own	accord.
The	buddha	arising	in	you	is	a	spontaneous	phenomenon.
This	was	the	story	I	had	told	 in	 the	Bodhgaya	conference.	Anand	Kausalyayan
was	 interested;	 the	 story	 was	 really	 beautiful.	 It	 was	 an	 absolutely	 clear
explanation	of	Buddhist	meditation.	You	have	just	to	wait,	don't	do	anything	--
otherwise	 you	will	make	 things	muddled.	 Just	wait	 by	 the	 side,	watch	 and	 be
patient,	and	it	is	going	to	happen.
He	said,	"The	story	really	impressed	me,	but	now	that	I	know	that	it	is	not	in	the
scriptures
..."
I	said,	"Does	it	interest	you	or	not?	Because	it	is	not	in	the	scriptures,	has	it	lost
its	significance?"
He	 said,	 "I	 have	 never	 encountered	 a	 person	 like	 you,	 who	 says,	 'What	 I	 am
saying,	 put	 it	 down	 into	 your	 scripture.'	 I	 would	 love	 to	 do	 it,	 but	 it	 is	 not
according	to	tradition,	and	nobody	will	accept	it."
I	said,	"It	does	not	matter,	you	accepted."
He	considered,	wavered	a	little	--	 looked	at	his	host	again	for	help,	because	he
had	entered	into	the	lion's	den	unnecessarily.	All	his	scholarship	was	useless.	In
the	face	of	truth	all	Osho	-	The	Miracle
53
Chapter	4	-	This	harvest	moon
scholarship	is	always	useless;	but	the	scholars	find	it	immensely	difficult	to	take
the	 jump	 beyond	 their	 mind,	 because	 their	 mind	 is	 so	 precious	 to	 them.	 It
contains	so	many	beautiful	scriptures,	it	is	their	respectability,	it	is	their	honor,	it
is	their	dignity,	it	is	the	whole	treasure	they	have.
It	is	a	strange	fact	that	the	more	you	know,	the	more	you	are	filled	with	borrowed
knowledge,	 the	 less	 is	 the	 possibility	 of	 your	 knowing	 the	 truth.	The	 less	 you
know,	the	less	knowledgeable	you	are,	the	greater	is	the	possibility	to	drop	your
mind,	 because	 it	 is	 worthless	 anyway.	 You	 don't	 know	 anything,	 you	 have
nothing	to	lose.	But	a	scholar	has	much	to	lose.
It	 is	good,	 in	a	way,	 that	we	discussed	Dogen	after	he	became	enlightened	and
now	we	 are	 discussing	 his	 difficult	 times,	when	 he	must	 have	 been	 a	man	 of
great	scholarship.	His	language	shows	it:
QUIETLY	 CONSIDER	 THE	 FACT	 THAT	 IF	 THIS	WERE	 A	 TIME	WHEN
THE	TRUE
DHARMA	 HAD	 NOT	 YET	 SPREAD	 THROUGHOUT	 THE	 WORLD,	 IT
WOULD	BE
IMPOSSIBLE	FOR	US	TO	COME	INTO	CONTACT	WITH	IT.
Now	 this	 is	 stupid.	 If	 Gautam	 Buddha	 could	 come	 to	 realize	 it	 without	 any
Buddhism	anywhere,	it	simply	shows	that	each	individual	is	capable	of	realizing
himself	without	any	tradition.	It	is	good,	and	encouraging,	that	there	have	been
buddhas	 before.	 To	 your	weak	 hearts	 it	 gives	 a	 certain	 nourishment,	 a	 certain
trustfulness.	But	it	is	not	a	scientific	fact.
Even	 if	 there	 had	 been	 no	 buddha	 before	 me,	 I	 would	 have	 been	 a	 buddha
anyway,	because	the	buddha	simply	means	an	awakened	soul.	Why	can't	I	wake
up?	Do	I	need	somebody	else	to	wake	up	first?	And	that,	too,	thousands	of	years
before?	 Because	 Gautam	 Buddha	 woke	 up	 thousands	 of	 years	 before	 Dogen,
does	 that	 help	 a	 sleeping	 person	 in	 any	way	 now?	 In	 fact	 the	 sleeping	 person
does	not	even	know	that	 somebody	has	become	awakened.	 In	what	way	can	 it
help?
This	 is	 just	 a	 scholar's	 mind.	 He	 is	 making	 a	 logical	 and	 rational	 statement:
because	Buddhism	has	 spread	 all	 over	 the	world,	 that	 has	made	us	 capable	 of
becoming	enlightened.
That	is	sheer	nonsense	--	scholarly,	of	course.
...	EVEN	IF	WE	WERE	WILLING	TO	SACRIFICE	OUR	LIVES	TO	DO	SO.
How	did	Buddha	attain	to	be	a	buddha?	By	risking	all.	Anybody	anywhere	--	in
any	time,	in	any	country	--	if	he	is	ready	to	risk	everything,	his	mind,	his	body,
and	just	be	a	watcher,	unidentified,	he	is	bound	to	become	a	buddha;	it	does	not
matter	whether	Gautam	Buddha	really	existed	or	not.
He	is	saying:
HOW	FORTUNATE	TO	HAVE	BEEN	BORN	IN	THE	PRESENT	DAY,	WHEN
WE
ARE	ABLE	TO	MAKE	THIS	ENCOUNTER!
Just	a	foolish	scholarly	statement.	Every	moment	 is	blessed	for	 the	courageous
one,	who	can	come	out	of	the	sheep's	skin	and	give	a	good	lion's	roar.
You	are	all	hiding,	because	to	be	a	sheep	is	secure;	the	crowd	is	unafraid	of	the
sheep.	Be	a	lion	and	all	the	crowds	around	the	world	become	afraid.	And	to	tell
people	 that	 they	 also	 are	 lions	 is	 the	 most	 dangerous	 thing	 to	 all	 the	 vested
interests.	As	sheep	they	can	oppress	you	because	you	are	ready	to	be	oppressed.
They	can	enslave	you	because	you	need,	deeply	need,	to	be	enslaved.	Alone	you
feel	almost	as	if	you	are	dying.	You	need	a	crowd	around	you,	it	feels	cozy	and
warm.
Osho	-	The	Miracle
54
Chapter	4	-	This	harvest	moon
Have	you	watched	sheep?	They	always	move	 in	a	crowd,	a	big	crowd,	almost
stepping	on	each	other.	Just	the	feeling	that	everybody	else	is	there,	there	is	no
need	to	be	afraid	...	But	nobody	has	seen	a	lion	moving	in	a	crowd	of	lions.	A
lion	moves	alone.	The	very	word
'crowd'	is	dishonorable.
These	scholars	want	you	to	understand	that	you	can	only	be	a	follower.	And	of
course	 to	be	 a	 follower	 a	master	 is	 needed.	 I	want	 to	 tell	 you	 that	 a	master	 is
helpful,	but	is	not	an	absolute	necessity.	A	master	is	helpful	only	in	the	sense	that
seeing	a	bird	fly,	its	small	children	gather	courage	and	start	fluttering	their	own
small	wings.	They	are	sitting	on	 the	edge	of	 their	nest,	 the	sky	seems	 to	be	so
vast	 and	 they	are	 so	 small.	But	 their	parents	 flying	around	 the	nest	 are	 simply
encouraging	them,	"Don't	be	afraid,	if	we	can	fly,	you	can	fly	also."
I	used	to	live	in	a	place	where	there	was	a	mango	grove.	Cuckoos	like	mangoes
very	much.
In	 a	 mango	 grove	 you	 will	 find	 cuckoos	 singing	 day	 and	 night.	 When	 the
newborn	 comes	 out	 of	 the	 egg	 --	 I	 have	 watched	 --	 trembling,	 hesitating,	 he
wants	to	fly,	just	as	the	mother	is	doing,	but	he	feels	afraid	because	he	has	never
done	it,	and	who	knows	whether	he	will	be	able	to	do	it	or	will	fall	to	the	ground
and	die?
The	 mother	 goes	 to	 a	 nearby	 tree	 and	 gives	 a	 call.	 Watching	 them	 I	 started
learning	their	language.	I	could	distinguish	the	call	of	a	lover	to	his	beloved,	and
the	 call	 from	a	mother	 to	 the	 child,	 and	 a	 call	 from	 the	 child	 to	 the	mother	 --
small	differences,	but	you	can	decipher	them.	The	mother's	call	is	simply	to	tell
the	child,	"Come	up	close	to	me,	it	is	not	far	away,	just	look!"	She	goes	around
the	 tree	 again.	 And	 I	 have	 seen	 that	 if	 the	 child	 cannot	 gather	 courage,	 just
flutters	but	remains	on	the	edge	of	the	nest,	the	mother	has	to	push	him.
It	is	worth	seeing	when	the	mother	pushes	the	child.	He	is	so	afraid,	it	is	just	as	if
somebody	is	pushing	you	into	ice-cold	water	and	you	don't	know	swimming.	But
he	flutters	his	wings,	he	cannot	do	anything	else,	he	has	 to	flutter;	he	has	seen
what	 the	mother	 was	 doing.	 And	within	 seconds	 the	 transformation	 --	 he	 has
gone	to	the	other	tree	from	where	the	mother	was	calling	him	and	gives	a	call	in
response,	"Now	you	can	come!"
Every	day	he	goes	farther	and	farther	and	a	day	comes	that	he	says	good-bye	and
never	comes	to	the	nest	again,	the	whole	sky	is	his.
The	 master	 is	 certainly	 a	 tremendous	 help.	 His	 very	 presence	 gives	 you	 a
guarantee,	his	very	authority	takes	away	your	fear	of	the	unknown,	but	he	is	not
absolutely	 necessary.	 You	 can	 take	 the	 jump	 without	 any	 master.	 Gautam
Buddha	did,	then	why	can't	you?	Why	does	Dogen	have	to	wait	for	Buddhism	to
spread	all	over	the	world	to	be	able	to	become	a	buddha?
I	don't	want	you	to	be	a	buddha	tomorrow.	There	is	no	need	to	wait.	The	buddha
is	your	nature.	All	that	is	needed	is	to	be	acquainted	with	it.
Now	sitting	here	 is	Rajendra	Anuragi.	He	has	a	high	post	 in	Madhya	Pradesh,
deputy-director	of	communications.	And	because	he	has	come	here	...	He	is	only
on	leave;	after	the	leave	finishes	he	is	going	to	take	retirement.
But	rumors	must	have	spread,	and	the	government	is	threatening	his	wife,	"You
vacate	 the	 government	 house,"	 and,	 "We	 are	 going	 to	 cut	 off	 the	 electricity,
telephone,	water."
But	Rajendra	Anuragi	 is	made	of	a	different	mettle.	I	know	him	from	my	very
childhood.	 I	 have	 sent	 him	 a	 message,	 "Don't	 be	 worried	 by	 such	 political
pressures,	just	tell	your	wife	and	your	children	that	if	the	government	takes	the
house,	'Here	is	your	home,	you	can	come	here.'"
Osho	-	The	Miracle
55
Chapter	4	-	This	harvest	moon
But	Rajendra	Anuragi	 is	not	 to	go	back.	Going	back	 is	very	cowardly.	And	all
these	threats
--	 they	 have	 not	 taken	 the	 house,	 they	 have	 not	 cut	 the	 telephone	 --	 all	 these
threats	are	simply	so	that	his	wife	becomes	afraid.	She	has	had	a	heart	attack,	she
has	been	hospitalized,	the	children	must	be	worried	--	naturally	the	government
must	be	thinking	that	Rajendra	Anuragi,	seeing	the	situation,	will	come	back.
For	a	 courageous	man,	no	 situation	exists	which	can	change	his	mind.	He	has
come	here	and	if	the	government	wants	the	house	--	although	it	is	illegal,	he	is
only	 on	 leave	 --	 they	 can	 take	 the	 house,	 they	 can	 take	 the	 telephone	 and	 the
electricity	and	the	water,	but	not	before	his	retirement.
But	 they	 cannot	 threaten	 a	man	 ...	This	 is	 how	 the	 crowd	goes	 on	 threatening
everybody	and	keeps	everybody	as	sheep.	Religions	force	you	to	be	sheep.	All
the	religions	want	followers,	but	this	place	is	for	the	masters.	Here	is	no	crowd,
but	an	assembly	of	lions,	just	meeting	together.	A	few	lions	are	asleep	...
(THERE	 IS	 A	 LOUD	 BELLY	 LAUGH	 FROM	 SARDAR	 GURUDAYAL
SINGH.)	It	does	not	matter,	it's	just	an	old	habit.	They	will	wake	up	when	they
will	hear	Sardar	Gurudayal	Singh.
I	 don't	 want	 you	 to	 be	 a	 follower,	 I	 want	 you	 to	 be	 yourself,	 absolutely,
categorically.	Only	then	you	can	find	your	buddhahood.	It	is	not	something	that
comes	from	outside	or	from	tradition,	 it	 is	something	that	has	to	be	discovered
within	yourself.
At	 the	most,	 the	master	can	be	a	help.	But	 the	master	 is	not	a	necessity.	And	I
have	to	remind	you,	the	master	can	also	become	a	hindrance,	because	you	may
start	thinking	that	because	you	have	a	master	you	don't	have	to	do	anything,	the
master	will	take	care.	There	are	people	who	are	saying	this.
Jesus	goes	on	saying,	"Believe	in	me"	--	don't	believe	in	yourself	--	"Believe	in
me	and	I	will	take	care."
Krishna	 says,	 "Believe	 in	 me	 and	 I	 will	 take	 care.	 Whenever	 there	 is	 some
problem	I	will	come	back."	Five	thousand	years	have	passed	and	there	have	been
problems	and	problems	and	I	am	waiting	to	see	the	guy	come	back!	But	not	even
a	postcard!	He	has	not	 left	even	a	phone	number!	These	people	have	deceived
millions	of	people	 for	 thousands	of	years.	People	become	believers,	 they	 think
that	that's	all	that	is	needed	of	them.
So	 in	 a	 sense	 a	 master	 can	 be	 a	 hindrance	 --	 if	 he	 promises	 you,	 "I	 will	 do
anything	 for	 you."	You	 have	 to	 find	 a	master	 like	me	who	 is	 so	 lazy	 ...	 I	 can
promise	you:	 I	will	 never	do	 anything	 for	you!	 I	 don't	 do	 anything	 for	myself
either.
But	there	are	times	when	I	need	to	hit	you.	I	had	to	call	back	from	Germany	a
solid	 stonehead;	 he	 is	 sitting	 there	with	 his	 staff.	But	 I	 don't	 order	 him	 to	 hit,
because	a	German	hit	can	be	dangerous.	Rather	than	making	you	enlightened	it
may	make	 you	 hospitalized,	 because	Germans	 don't	 know	 that	 these	 Japanese
masters	were	not	really	hitting,	they	were	just	using	very	light	bamboos.	I	have
never	heard	 that	anybody's	head	was	broken	or	 that	anybody	got	a	 fracture,	so
naturally	I	conclude	that	those	hits	were	just	playful.
Osho	-	The	Miracle
56
Chapter	4	-	This	harvest	moon
The	master	can	be	a	help	if	he	is	just	a	friend,	a	presence	in	which	you	can	learn
to	be	yourself,	a	presence	which	can	encourage	you	 to	fly	 into	 the	sky.	But	he
can	be	a	hindrance	if	he	promises,	"I	will	deliver	you	from	your	sins."
Jesus	was	continually	asked	when	the	day	of	judgment	would	come,	because	on
the	day	of	 judgment	all	 the	souls	will	wake	up	from	their	graves	and	God	will
decide	 who	 is	 a	 sinner	 and	 who	 is	 a	 saint.	 And	 Jesus	 said,	 "I	 am	 his	 only
begotten	son,	I	will	point	out	who	are	my	people.	For	them	a	special	concession
...	they	will	enter	into	paradise	without	any	difficulty."
It	 has	 been	 asked	 in	 the	 Bible	 again	 and	 again	 ...	 because	 the	 disciples	 were
worried,
"When	is	this	day	of	judgment	going	to	happen?"
And	 he	 used	 to	 say,	 "Soon."	Two	 thousand	 years	 have	 passed,	 he	 himself	 has
passed,	and	the	day	of	judgment	has	not	happened.	And	I	tell	you	it	will	never
happen,	because	there	is	no	God	to	judge	and	there	is	no	time	where	existence
comes	 to	an	end.	And	what	crimes	have	you	done?	Every	crime	that	you	have
done	reflects	God	and	his	work.
Now	psychologists	are	becoming	more	and	more	clear	that	if	somebody	murders
it	 is	 not	 a	 crime,	 it	 is	 just	 hormonal,	 his	 chemistry	 is	 wrong.	 And	 our	 stupid
judiciary	 goes	 on	 hanging	 these	 poor	 people	who	 are	 suffering	 from	 a	wrong
chemistry	 for	which	 they	 are	 not	 responsible.	 If	 you	want	 to	 hang	 somebody,
hang	God!	He	is	the	only	murderer,	the	only	man	who	has	raped,	the	only	man
who	has	been	stealing,	because	all	these	things	are	built	into	your	biology.
Somebody	becomes	 a	 thief	 because	of	 a	 certain	biology;	what	 he	needs	 is	 not
imprisonment,	 but	 treatment,	 psychological	 and	 physiological.	 Nobody	 is	 a
criminal,	who	are	you	going	to	judge?	But	making	people	afraid	...	"The	day	of
judgment	is	very	close,	be	quick	and	have	faith	in	me	and	I	will	recognize	you	as
one	of	my	people.	Otherwise	you	will	be	lost	in	a	crowd	of	millions	of	skeletons,
all	around	the	world."	And	God	can	not	refuse	his	only	begotten	son's	followers,
he	has	to	accept	them.
These	 people	 like	 Jesus	 or	 Krishna	 who	 have	 made	 it	 a	 point	 that	 following
them,	 having	 faith	 in	 them,	 is	 going	 to	 save	 you	 ...	 they	 are	 criminals,	 utter
criminals,	because	they	have	been	deceiving	millions	of	people	for	thousands	of
years.	Nobody	can	save	you	except	you.
An	 authentic	master	 is	 going	 to	 emphasize	 in	 thousands	 of	ways	 that	 you	 are
your	own	savior.	In	fact	this	should	be	the	criterion	of	whether	the	master	is	true
or	 a	 fraud.	 If	 he	 says,	 "I	 am	 going	 to	 save	 you,"	 he	 is	 a	 fraud,	 because	 he	 is
keeping	 you	 away	 from	 yourself;	 he	 is	 preventing	 you	 from	 discovering	 your
buddhahood;	he	is	putting	himself	above	you	--
superior,	savior,	messenger,	God's	son,	God's	incarnation.	And	you?	You	are	just
poor	animals,	 just	monkeys	who	have	accidentally	 fallen	 from	the	 trees	and	 in
falling	have	lost	their	tails.
This	was	a	very	great	problem	for	Charles	Darwin.	When	he	proposed	his	thesis
that	man	is	a	descendant	of	the	apes,	the	question	was	necessarily	asked,	"Where
is	man's	tail?"	But	fortunately	or	unfortunately,	there	is	a	place	in	your	backbone
which	shows	that	there	used	to	be	something	attached	which	is	now	missing.	A
monkey	without	a	 tail	 is	 impossible;	 the	 tail	 is	his	glory.	But	Darwin	found	on
skeletons	the	place	where	the	tail	must	have	been	attached,	otherwise	why	is	this
place	left	there?	Something	is	missing.
Charles	Darwin	was	not	making	an	effort	to	prove	that	you	are	a	buddha,	he	was
trying	his	whole	 life	 to	 prove	 that	 you	 are	 just	monkeys	gone	 astray.	You	 lost
your	tail	in	the	meantime	and	now	have	forgotten	completely	how	to	jump	from
tree	to	tree.	All	the	monkeys	must	be	Osho	-	The	Miracle

laughing,	 seeing	 these	 idiots	 standing	 on	 two	 legs.	 This	 is	 not	 natural	 --
abnormal	monkeys,	stubborn	...	adamant	outcasts,	unfit	monkeys	rejected	by	the
society	perhaps.
Jesus	says	you	are	sheep	and	he	is	the	shepherd.	All	these	people	are	consistently
trying	to	take	away	your	dignity	as	human	beings.
I	say	to	you	that	you	are	the	ultimate	consciousness.	You	are	not	 the	body	and
you	are	not	the	mind;	you	are	the	buddha,	the	awakened	one.	It	is	just	a	question
of	 sleeping	 or	 waking,	 not	 much	 of	 a	 difference.	 The	 sleeping	 person	 is	 not
inferior	 just	 because	you	 are	 awake	 and	 cannot	 sleep.	His	 sleep	 simply	 shows
that	he	is	relaxed,	while	you	are	unnecessarily	making	efforts	to	wake	him.
I	 sometimes	 wonder	 whether	 I	 am	 doing	 the	 right	 thing.	 Sleeping	 people,
rejoicing	in	their	misery,	in	their	suffering	...	and	I	am	unnecessarily	pulling	their
legs	to	get	them	out	of	their	misery.	They	think	misery	is	their	blanket	and	they
cling	to	the	blanket.	But	whether	I	am	right	or	wrong,	I	enjoy	pulling	legs.
Dogen	said:
WE	 ARE	 NOW	 ABLE	 TO	 COME	 IN	 CONTACT	 WITH	 THE	 BUDDHA
SAKYAMUNI	 AND	 HEAR	 HIS	 TEACHINGS	 DUE	 TO	 THE
COMPASSIONATE	KINDNESS	THAT
HAS	RESULTED	FROM	THE	CONSTANT	PRACTICE	OF	EACH	OF	THE
BUDDHAS
AND	PATRIARCHS.
You	 can	 see	 the	 language,	 it	 is	 that	 of	 a	 scholar	 and	 he	 is	making	 absolutely
wrong	 statements.	 It	 is	 not	 because	 of	 the	 buddhas	 in	 the	 past	 that	 you	 can
become	 a	 buddha.	 You	 can	 become	 a	 buddha	 because	 you	 are	 essentially	 a
buddha.	The	past	buddhas	may	help	you	as	a	reminder,	but	not	more	than	that.
There	is	a	danger	also	that	you	may	start	worshipping	them,	and	once	you	start
worshipping	you	will	never	remember	your	own	buddha.
It	 is	 such	 an	 absurdity	 that	 a	 living	 buddha	 is	 worshipping	 a	 stone	 buddha,
praying	to	a	stone	buddha	made	by	human	hands.	It	is	so	hilarious	that	all	over
the	world,	in	all	the	temples	of	the	so-called	gods,	people	are	worshipping	toys.
I	 have	 told	 Avirbhava,	 "Collect	 all	 kinds	 of	 toys.	 We	 will	 make	 a	 beautiful
museum	and	I	appoint	you	the	director	general."	She	has	brought	me	a	beautiful
bear	which	walks,	which	makes	sounds	very	similar	to	Avirbhava,	and	when	he
makes	the	sounds	he	waves	his	tail.	It	is	really	a	beautiful	toy.
But	all	the	gods	are	not	even	that	much	alive.	The	bear	at	least	moves,	waves	its
tail	 and	 makes	 sounds	 --	 and	 strangely	 enough	 those	 sounds	 are	 exactly	 like
Avirbhava	makes.
Tomorrow	you	will	see;	Avirbhava	will	bring	it	herself.
(THE	 MASTER	 IS	 LAUGHING	 SO	 MUCH	 THAT	 HE	 HAS	 DIFFICULTY
SPEAKING.
AVIRBHAVA	IS	ALSO	LAUGHING	LOUDLY.)
Now	this	is	...	give	it	a	try	...	how	he	walks	and	makes	the	sound	...	You	will	just
be	missing	the	tail,	otherwise	you	are	perfect.
We	are	going	to	make	a	museum	of	all	kinds	of	toys	which	humanity	has	been
worshipping,	 so	when	 visitors	 come	 you	 can	 show	 them	 that	 "These	 are	 your
gods!"
But	 as	 far	 as	 I	 am	 concerned,	 it	 is	 not	 needed	 at	 all	 for	 any	 buddhas	 to	 have
preceded	me	or	 to	precede	you.	I	don't	accept	any	followers	and	I	don't	accept
any	predecessors.	Successors	or	Osho	-	The	Miracle
58
Chapter	4	-	This	harvest	moon
predecessors	are	not	needed,	you	are	enough	unto	yourself.	It	is	just	a	question
of	awakening.
So	everybody	will	wake	up	--	how	long	can	you	sleep?	We	will	go	on	harassing
you.
IF	 THE	 BUDDHAS	 AND	 PATRIARCHS	 HAD	 NOT	 DIRECTLY
TRANSMITTED	THE
DHARMA,	HOW	COULD	IT	HAVE	COME	DOWN	TO	US	TODAY?
Absolute	bullshit!	 --	but	very	scholarly,	supported	by	 the	scriptures.	Dharma	is
your	very	nature,	that	is	the	meaning	of	the	word	'dharma'.	Just	as	coldness	is	the
dharma	 of	 ice	 and	 heat	 is	 the	 dharma	 of	 fire,	 buddhahood	 is	 your	 dharma.
Awareness	is	your	dharma,	your	fire,	your	coolness,	your	nature.	It	has	nothing
to	do	with	anybody	who	has	become	enlightened	before	you.
Even	if	the	whole	history	is	completely	erased,	it	won't	affect	in	any	way	people
becoming	 enlightened.	 Because	 it	 is	 their	 nature,	 sooner	 or	 later	 they	 will
blossom.	They	may	go	astray	a	little	bit	here	and	there	and	that	is	nothing	wrong
...	 just	going	for	a	morning	walk,	or	being	lost	in	a	bazaar,	 in	a	shopping	mall.
But	finally	you	will	have	to	come	home.	You	will	have	to	realize	yourself.	Hence
I	cannot	support	Dogen's	idea.
He	says:
THE	 TRUE	WAY	OF	 EXPRESSING	 THIS	 GRATITUDE	 CAN	 BE	 FOUND
ONLY	IN
OUR	DAILY	PRACTICE	ITSELF.
Gratitude	 for	 what?	 He	 is	 asking	 you	 to	 be	 grateful	 for	 Gautam	 Buddha,	 for
Bodhidharma,	for	other	patriarchs	and	masters.	Gratitude	is	a	by-product.	He	is
not	 aware	 about	 the	 very	 psychology	 of	man.	Gratitude	 comes	 after	 you	 have
become	a	buddha.	Then	you	feel	gratitude	towards	existence;	then	you	feel	the
miracle	 that	 you	 have	 not	 asked	 for	 anything	 and	 you	 have	 been	 given
everything,	all	the	mysteries.
Dogen	goes	on	saying:
HOW	TRANSIENT	OUR	LIFE	IS!	TO	UTTER	TWO	OR	THREE	WORDS	OF
THE
BUDDHAS	 AND	 PATRIARCHS	 COMPLETELY	 IS	 TO	 EXPRESS	 THE
BUDDHAS	AND
PATRIARCHS	THEMSELVES	FULLY.	WHY	IS	THIS	SO?
IN	THEIR	REALM	THERE	IS	NO	GAP	BETWEEN	BODY	AND	MIND,	SO
EVERY
WORD	OF	THEIR	UTTERING	IS	THEIR	WARM	BODY	AND	MIND.
THEREFORE,	WHEN	WE	BECOME	THE	BUDDHAS	AND	PATRIARCHS,
WE
TRANSCEND	THEM.
He	has	not	 yet	 become	a	buddha.	He	does	not	 know	 transcendence,	 he	 is	 still
talking	about	it.
THIS	IS	THE	PRACTICAL	EXPRESSION	OF	TWO	OR	THREE	WORDS	OF
BUDDHAS	AND	THE	PATRIARCHS.
SO	 I	 STRONGLY	 URGE	 YOU	 TO	 PURSUE	 THE	 PRACTICE	 OF	 THE
BUDDHAS
AND	PATRIARCHS.
This	 is	 the	way	 of	 a	 teacher,	 of	 a	 priest,	 of	 a	 professor;	 but	 these	 are	 not	 the
words	of	a	man	who	is	awakened.	The	awakened	people	speak	in	a	very	different
way	--	the	same	words,	but	they	have	a	different	nuance	to	them.

A	haiku	by	Basho:
ALONG	THE	MOUNTAIN	ROAD
SOMEHOW	IT	TUGS	AT	MY	HEART:
A	WILD	VIOLET.
Now,	he	is	saying	more	than	any	scholar	can	say.
A	WILD	VIOLET.
SOMEHOW	IT	TUGS	AT	MY	HEART:
ALONG	THE	MOUNTAIN	ROAD.
A	man	of	 silence	 and	 understanding,	 a	man	 of	 consciousness,	 understands	 the
beauty	of	existence,	even	of	a	wild	flower.
A	haiku	by	Kikaku:
MAY	HE	WHO	BRINGS	FLOWERS
TONIGHT,
HAVE	MOONLIGHT.
Because	 the	 same	 flowers	 in	moonlight	 suddenly	 have	 a	 different	 splendor.	 In
the	silence	of	the	night	with	the	full	moon,	if	somebody	brings	even	some	wild
flowers	they	have	such	immense	beauty.
But	this	beauty	and	this	silence	are	not	for	the	mind	to	understand,	they	are	for
the	being	to	experience.
Ryota	writes:
THAT	THERE	IS	ONLY	ONE
IS	UNBELIEVABLE	TONIGHT.
THIS	HARVEST	MOON!
He	is	saying	that	there	is	only	one	buddha	--	that's	what	the	tradition	says	--	who
can	save	the	world.
THAT	THERE	IS	ONLY	ONE
IS	UNBELIEVABLE	TONIGHT.
THIS	HARVEST	MOON!
In	 the	 beauty	 of	 this	 harvest	 moon,	 in	 this	 silent	 sky	 full	 of	 stars,	 it	 is
unbelievable	that	in	the	whole	history	of	mankind	there	was	only	one	man	who
became	a	buddha.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	4	-	This	harvest	moon
And	 I	 absolutely	 support	 Ryota.	 There	 have	 been	 many	 buddhas	 in	 many
different	places,	of	different	races,	from	different	countries.	They	may	not	have
been	called	buddhas,	 they	may	have	 spoken	different	 languages,	 they	may	not
have	 spoken	 at	 all;	 their	 existence	 may	 not	 have	 been	 recorded.	 But	 it	 is
impossible	to	believe	that	in	four	million	years	there	has	been	only	one	man	who
attained	to	the	highest	peak	of	consciousness.
At	least	I	can	say:	Forget	the	one,	because	I	have	touched	the	same	peak.	From
now	 onwards	 remember	 two	 buddhas!	 I	 cannot	 say	 anything	 about	 any	 other
buddhas;	they	may	have	been	pretenders,	they	may	have	been	just	imitators.	But
I	 can	 say	with	 absolute	 authority	 that	 I	have	known	myself	 and	 I	have	known
myself	more	than	Gautam	Buddha	himself,	because	he	got	stuck	at	a	point.
He	himself	describes	it	in	a	beautiful	way	...	In	China	there	are	ten	pictures,	just
like	Tarot	cards,	which	are	called,	"The	Ten	Zen	Bulls."
In	 the	 first	 card	 the	 bull	 has	 escaped	 from	 his	 owner.	 In	 the	 second	 card	 the
owner	is	searching	for	him	but	does	not	know	which	way	he	has	gone.	In	deep
mountains,	valleys,	forests	...	which	direction	has	he	taken?	In	the	third	he	finds
the	footprints	of	the	bull.
In	the	fourth,	following	the	footprints	he	finds	the	bull	hiding	behind	a	tree,	just
his	back	is	seen	in	the	picture.	In	the	fifth	he	has	seen	the	whole	bull.
In	the	sixth	he	catches	hold	of	the	bull.	It	is	a	struggle,	the	bull	does	not	want	to
go	back	home,	he	has	found	the	freedom	of	the	forest	and	the	mountains	and	the
rivers.	But	in	the	seventh	the	owner	is	dragging	him	back.	In	the	eighth	he	has
conquered	 the	bull.	 In	 the	ninth	 the	bull	 is	 in	 the	 stable	 and	 the	man	 is	 sitting
under	his	 roof,	playing	a	 flute.	 In	 the	 tenth,	 the	man	 is	going	 towards	 the	pub
with	a	bottle	in	his	hand.
Buddha	 has	 described	 that	 there	 comes	 a	 point	 when	 a	 buddha	 forgets	 his
enlightenment.	 It	becomes	so	natural	 that	 there	 is	no	need	 to	remember	 it.	The
tenth	is	the	transcendence	beyond	buddha.
When	 this	pack	of	cards	came	 to	Japan	 they	dropped	 the	 tenth	card	because	 it
looks	very	irreligious.	It	is	perfectly	good	that	the	bull	has	been	found	--	the	bull
represents	the	truth	--
that	 the	 buddha	 is	 at	 ease	 playing	 his	 flute.	 But	 the	 tenth	 seems	 to	 be	 very
dangerous.	 So	 in	 Japan	 they	 dropped	 the	 tenth,	 they	 brought	 only	 nine	 cards.
They	were	not	courageous	enough	to	see	a	buddha	sitting	in	a	pub	sipping	beer.
But	I	would	like	the	tenth	card	to	be	added	again.	It	is	beyond	Buddha	himself,
because	 he	 himself	 said,	 "I	 am	 at	 the	 ninth	 stage.	 The	 tenth	 stage	 is	 just	 to
become	ordinary	and	simple,	so	simple	that	you	can	even	get	drunk.	Just	a	cup
of	wine,	sitting	with	your	friends	enjoying	..."
The	 Japanese	 priests	 became	 aware	 that	 this	 is	 a	 very	 dangerous	 card;	 every
drunkard	will	start	saying	that	he	has	transcended	Buddha.	But	being	so	afraid	of
the	drunkards	...	Anyway	they	think	they	have	transcended	everything,	they	don't
wait	for	your	card.	Just	look	at	a	drunkard,	he	believes	already	that	he	is	a	god.
Because	 of	 these	 drunkards	 they	 have	 dropped	 a	 very	 significant	 point.	 The
bottle	and	the	pub	were	only	symbolic,	symbolic	of	being	very	ordinary	--	 just
being	simple	as	everybody	else	is.	Once	in	a	while	if	a	buddha	takes	a	little	wine,
just	to	give	company	to	other	buddhas	who	may	be	asleep,	I	will	not	object.

Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
WHAT	IS	IT	ABOUT	MAN	TODAY	THAT	HE	IS	NOT	ONLY	LACKING	IN
THE
SIMPLICITY	AND	 INNOCENCE	OF	THE	PEOPLE	WE	HEAR	ABOUT	 IN
THESE	ZEN
DISCOURSES,	BUT	THAT	HE	IS	SO	WARY	OF	COMMITMENT?
IT	 IS	 AS	 IF	 WE	 ARE	 AFRAID	 TO	 HAVE	 ALL	 OUR	 EGGS	 IN	 ONE
BASKET;	OR
ARE	OBSESSED	WITH	EXPERIENCING	SIMPLY	EVERYTHING	THAT	IS
AVAILABLE.	SO	WE	END	UP	HAVING	TASTED	EVERYTHING	AND	NOT
BEING
NOURISHED	BY	ANYTHING.
Maneesha,	 as	 far	 as	 man's	 inner	 pilgrimage	 is	 concerned,	 time	 is	 not	 a
consideration.	In	every	age,	in	every	time,	the	same	was	the	problem	--	and	the
same	was	the	solution.	We	are	not	in	any	way	encountering	something	new.	It	is
the	 same	 old	 sleep,	 the	 same	 old	 unconsciousness,	 the	 same	 old	mind	 full	 of
thoughts	which	does	not	allow	us	to	move	beyond	it.
Nothing	 has	 changed	 as	 far	 as	 discovering	 the	 buddha	 is	 concerned.	 It	 is	 not
relative	 to	 time	 or	 to	 space.	 Any	 time,	 in	 any	 space,	 it	 is	 available.	 And	 the
hindrances	are	the	same:	your	mind	weaving	thoughts	day	and	night,	dreaming,
imagining,	hallucinating.	You	are	caught	up	in	this	hole,	so	badly	entangled	that
it	seems	difficult	to	get	out	of	it.	But	the	way	is	simple	--
you	don't	have	to	get	out	of	it.	You	simply	don't	cling	to	it,	and	it	will	drop	on	its
own	accord.
That's	 what	 I	 call	 meditation.	 You	 simply	 stand	 aloof	 and	 just	 see	 the	 mind
disappearing,	like	a	cloud	on	a	faraway	horizon,	leaving	the	sky	clean	and	pure.
And	in	that	state	arises	your	consciousness	in	its	full	glory,	in	its	full	celebration.
It	is	not	without	any	reason	that	I	want	you	to	end	up	your	meditation	every	day
with	celebration,	with	 rejoicing.	Slowly	slowly,	as	meditation	becomes	deeper,
your	 celebration	will	 have	more	 splendor,	 it	will	 become	more	majestic,	more
miraculous.
Before	 we	 enter	 into	 our	 daily	 meditation,	 just	 to	 wake	 up	 the	 sleeping	 and
snoring	buddhas	...
The	 third	world	war	 is	 just	 starting,	 and	after	 two	 thousand	years	 Jesus	Christ
arrives,	unannounced,	in	New	York.	He	has	come	to	give	a	speech	to	the	United
Nations	Assembly.
It	is	late	and	he	is	tired	after	his	journey.	He	looks	around	for	a	hotel,	but	finds
that	none	of	 them	has	a	 room.	Finally,	 in	a	 little	back	 street,	 Jesus	 sees	a	 sign
which	reads,	"The	Camel	and	Cow	Inn	--	Vacancy."
He	ties	his	donkey	to	a	lamppost,	goes	inside,	and	walks	up	to	the	receptionist.
Putting	his	hand	in	his	pocket,	Jesus	pulls	out	some	old,	rusty	nails	and	throws
them	on	the	desk.
"Excuse	me,"	he	asks,	"can	you	put	me	up	for	the	night?"

Then	she	leaves	the	window,	walks	over	to	the	bank	manager	and	whispers	in	his
ear.	The	two	of	them	return	to	where	Chester	is	waiting.
"What?"	says	the	manager	icily,	"seems	to	be	the	problem	here?"
"There	is	no	fucking	problem,"	insists	Chester.	"I	just	won	ten	million	dollars	in
the	lottery	and	I	want	to	open	a	goddamn	current	account!"

Larry	sits	down	opposite	her.
"Lulu,"	he	asks	her	sympathetically,	"what	is	wrong?"
"Oh!	Everything,"	she	sobs.	"My	cat,	Tiddles,	has	disappeared,	I	got	fired	from
my	job,	I	am	being	thrown	out	of	my	apartment,	and	the	doctors	tell	me	I	have

"That	is	terrible,"	says	Larry	in	a	concerned	voice.	"What	about	if	I	take	you	out

only	the	buddha	is.
One	consciousness,
one	oceanic	consciousness,
and	you	are	drowned	in	it.
Drink	this	experience	as	much	as	you	can.
Let	it	sink	into	your	every	cell,
into	your	breathing,
your	heartbeat,
so	that	it	remains	twenty-four	hours	with	you,
just	like	an	undercurrent.
This	moment	there	is	no	time,
no	space.	This	moment
you	have	transcended	history,	mind.	This	moment
you	are	only	pure	consciousness,
just	a	light	unto	yourself.
This	is	what	is	meant	by	being	a	buddha.
To	make	it	absolutely	clear,	Nivedano	...

Relax,	let	go.
The	body	is	dead,
the	mind	is	gone	far	away.
You	are	left	only	with	a	small	center,
but	this	center	is	the	door	to	existence.
From	this	center
you	are	joined	with	the	universal	heart.
Never	forget	the	way.
It	is	very	simple,
from	mind	to	heart
and	from	heart	to	being
and	from	being	to	pure	space.
This	pure	space	is

Come	back	from	your	inner	journey,
silently,	slowly.
There	is	no	hurry.	Sit	down	for	a	few	moments,
reminding	yourself	you	are	a	buddha.
This	reminding	every	day
that	you	are	a	buddha
will	become	just	like	breathing.
You	don't	have	to	remember;
just	like	the	heartbeat
you	don't	have	to	remember.

COULD	BE	A	BUDDHA	OR	A	PATRIARCH.
IT	IS	JUST	AS	IF	WE	WERE	MAKING	INNUMERABLE	SMALL	RIVERS
JOIN	 A	 GREAT	 ONE,	 OR	 KEEPING	 THE	 LIGHT	 FROM	 GOING	 OUT,
MAKING	COUNTLESS
LIGHTS	ONE	AFTER	ANOTHER:	 EVENTUALLY,	 THEY	BECOME	ONE.
AND	THERE
IS	 NO	 GAP	 IN	 THE	 FUNCTION	 OF	 THE	 TRANSMISSION	 BETWEEN
MASTER	AND
DISCIPLE.
SO	 SUCCESSIVE	 PATRIARCHS	 SPENT	 THEIR	 DAILY	 LIFE	 FACE-TO-
FACE	WITH
SAKYAMUNI	 BUDDHA	 AND	 WATCHED	 BY	 HIS	 FACE.	 HOW	 MANY
DAYS	THEY
HAD	PASSED,	 I	DON'T	KNOW.	WE	SHOULD	THINK	CALMLY	AND	BE
GLAD	OF
THIS.	 THEIR	 EYE	 AND	 FACE	 ARE	 THE	 BUDDHA'S	 BECAUSE	 THEY
MADE	BOWS
TO	THE	BUDDHA'S	 FACE	AND	TRANSFERRED	HIS	 EYE	 INTO	THEIR
OWN,	AND
VICE	VERSA.
IT	IS	THROUGH	THE	TRANSMISSION	THAT	THE	EYE	AND	FACE	HAD
BEEN
INCESSANTLY	TRANSMITTED	TILL	NOW.
THERE	 IS	NO	GAP	 IN	THE	TRANSMISSION	BETWEEN	MASTER	AND
DISCIPLE,	 JUST	AS	ONE	VINE	COILS	ROUND	ANOTHER;	THAT	IS	TO
SAY,	WE	OPEN	OUR
EYES	 AND	 PRESENT	 THEM	 WITH	 THEMSELVES,	 THEY	 RECEIVE
THEMSELVES.
THE	SAME	CAN	ALSO	BE	SAID	OF	OUR	FACE,	MIND	AND	BODY.
UNLESS	A	DISCIPLE	SEES	HIS	MASTER,	HE	CANNOT	BE	SAID	TO	BE	A
DISCIPLE;	UNLESS	A	MASTER	SEES	HIS	DISCIPLE,	HE	CANNOT	BE	A
MASTER.
BOTH	OF	THEM	HAVE	GOT	THE	TRANSMISSION	AND	SUCCEEDED	TO
THE
DHARMA	 BY	 SEEING	 EACH	 OTHER.	 THAT	 IS	 AN	 APPEARANCE	 OF
THE
TRANSMISSION	 OF	 THE	 PATRIARCHS.	 THEREFORE,	 THEY	 COULD
DIRECTLY
TOUCH	THE	BUDDHA'S	FINE	FACE.
AT	THE	TIME	OF	THE	TRANSMISSION,	OUR	FACE	WILL	CHANGE
COMPLETELY.	THE	SKIN	ITSELF	WILL	BE	A	GREAT	MIRROR	OF	THE
BUDDHAS,	 WHICH	 HAS	 NO	 FLAW	 INSIDE	 OR	 OUT.	 THE	 GREAT
MIRROR	GIVES	THE

OF	THE
TATHAGATA	SHOULD	PRESERVE	IT	CAREFULLY.
Maneesha,	 before	 I	 enter	 into	 the	 serious	 statements	 of	 a	 scholarly	 Dogen,	 I
would	like	Avirbhava	first	to	inaugurate.
It	is	not	a	bear,	as	I	said	yesterday	--	because	around	the	world	I	have	so	many
cases	 against	 me,	 accusing	me	 of	 hurting	 people's	 religious	 feelings.	 And	 the
bear	is	worshipped	by	men.
It	 is	 really	 a	 pig.	 I	 had	 to	 ask	 Anando	 to	 research	 whether	 somebody's	 heart
feelings	would	be	hurt	if	we	inaugurate	the	Museum	of	the	Ancient	Dead	Gods
with	 a	 pig.	 Avirbhava	 is	 going	 to	 be	 the	 Director	 General.	 She	 is	 completely
ready	--	with	the	ears	of	a	pig,	and	a	tail	too.
(AVIRBHAVA	IS	DRESSED	IN	PIG	EARS	AND	A	CURLY	TAIL.)	About	pigs:
"In	the	ancient	world	pigs	were	considered	the	embodiment	of	the	'Corn	Spirit',
Osiris.	He	was	the	great	Egyptian	god	of	the	underworld	and	judge	of	the	dead.
In	 Greece	 pigs	 were	 sacred	 to	 Demeter,	 the	 goddess	 of	 the	 fruitful	 soil	 and
agriculture.
And	today	they	are	considered	sacred	in	New	Guinea.
In	China	the	pig	is	considered	a	great	delicacy	and,	as	in	many	other	countries	in
the	 past	 too,	was	 traditionally	 served	 at	 banquets	 and	 feasts,	 notably	marriage
ceremonies.	While	people	ate	the	roasted	pork,	they	could	view	the	stuffed	pig	in
the	center	of	the	banquet	table.
Great	care	was	always	taken	to	choose	a	pig's	head	that	had	a	pleasing	face.
Pigs	were	particularly	popular	at	marriages	because	they	represented	virtue	and
fertility.
Generally,	in	China,	pigs	are	venerated	because	they	represent	good	fortune."
So	it	is	absolutely	appropriate	for	Avirbhava	to	inaugurate	the	museum	with	her
own	hands.
Avirbhava,	bring	your	pig	...	and	inaugurate!
(AVIRBHAVA	 PLACES	 A	 CUDDLY	 SOFT	 PINK	 PIG	 ON	 THE	 PODIUM
AND	IT
PROCEEDS	 TO	 WADDLE	 ACROSS	 THE	 MARBLE	 IN	 FRONT	 OF	 THE
MASTER'S
FEET,	 MAKING	 GRUNTING	 NOISES	 AS	 ITS	 SNOUT	 AND	 TAIL
WRIGGLE.)	That	is	good.
Now	we	can	turn	to	the	serious	matter.
Even	this	inauguration	will	hurt	many	people's	religious	beliefs,	so	there	will	be
a	 few	 more	 cases.	 But	 this	 has	 been	 the	 right	 ancient	 god	 with	 which	 to
inaugurate	 this	museum,	where	we	 are	 going	 to	 collect	 all	 the	 dead	 gods	 that
have	been	worshipped	by	a	stupid	humanity.
Buddhas	 have	 been	 forced	 to	 worship	 pigs	 and	 nobody	 has	 objected.	 Stones,
monkeys,	elephants	--	you	name	it,	they	have	all	been	worshipped	somewhere	or
other.	 But	 nowhere	 in	 the	 whole	 history	 of	 mankind	 has	man	 been	 given	 the
dignity	of	a	god.	 I	am	for	 the	 first	 time	giving	you	 the	dignity	of	a	god,	and	 I
want	you	to	make	a	plaything	of	all	the	so-called	gods	Osho	-	The	Miracle
67
Chapter	5	-	You	must	see	for	yourself
worshipped	by	humanity.	It	 is	such	a	degradation,	such	a	humiliation.	But	man
has	accepted	slavery	without	revolting	against	it.
If	 the	 crowd	 was	 worshipping	 the	 pig	 they	 followed	 the	 crowd,	 because	 the
crowd	gave	them	security	and	coziness	and	they	had	not	 the	courage	to	revolt.
Our	museum	will	be	specially	devoted	to	all	those	idiots	who	have	worshipped
animals	 rather	 than	 searching	 for	 their	 own	 super-human	 consciousness,	 their
own	 buddha;	 looking	 into	 mosques	 and	 synagogues	 and	 temples	 rather	 than
looking	into	themselves.
It	 will	 create	 legal	 problems,	 but	 that	 does	 not	 matter.	 I	 have	 faced	 legal
problems	 my	 whole	 life.	 I	 tremendously	 enjoy	 the	 stupidity	 of	 the	 judiciary
around	the	world.	They	are	still	protecting	those	people	whose	feelings	are	hurt
if	you	say	anything	about	the	pigs.	In	the	name	of	religion	all	kinds	of	nonsense
has	been	forced	on	man's	mind.
My	basic	function	is	to	take	away	all	this	nonsense	from	you	so	you	can	come
out	in	your	full	glory	--	a	full	moon,	a	buddha,	sufficient	unto	yourself.	I	don't
teach	 any	 prayer,	 I	 simply	 teach	 exploration	 of	 the	 inner	 world.	 There	 is	 the
treasure;	not	in	the	scriptures,	as	Dogen	is	saying.
DOGEN	WROTE:
SUCCESSIVE	 PATRIARCHS	 PERSONALLY	 TRANSMITTED	 THE
DHARMA	FROM	MASTER	TO	DISCIPLE.
It	 is	a	half	 truth,	and	a	half	 truth	 is	more	dangerous	 than	a	 lie.	A	lie	 is	at	 least
complete.
Half	truths	are	very	dangerous	because	they	hide	the	lie	behind	them,	so	on	the
surface	it	looks	as	if	what	is	projected	is	true.
What	he	is	saying	--	that	SUCCESSIVE	PATRIARCHS	PERSONALLY
TRANSMITTED	 THE	 DHARMA	 FROM	MASTER	 TO	 DISCIPLE	 --	 has	 a
little	truth	in	it.
That	has	been	so	with	most	of	the	masters,	that	they	have	received	the	essence,
the	experience,	 in	the	presence	of	a	master.	It	has	been	a	transmission	between
two	energies.	But	it	is	not	an	absolute	principle	that	he	is	making:
WITHOUT	 THE	 PERSONAL	 TRANSMISSION	 NOT	 A	 SINGLE
PATRIARCH,	 MASTER	 OR	 DISCIPLE	 COULD	 BE	 A	 BUDDHA	 OR	 A
PATRIARCH.
This	 is	 so	obviously	stupid	 --	because	who	was	 the	master	of	Gautam	Buddha
himself?
From	where	did	he	get	the	transmission?
According	to	Dogen	he	needed	to	have	a	master	--	but	he	had	none.	It	is	only	a
half	truth.
But	the	other	half	is	more	important,	for	the	simple	reason	that	you	may	not	find
a	master,	but	the	universal	spirit	is	always	available	everywhere.
The	 really	 courageous	 people	 simply	 take	 the	 jump	 into	 the	 universal	 being
without	being	pushed	by	a	master.	It	simply	depends	on	your	courage.
To	 be	 a	 buddha	 is	 your	 birthright.	 Just	 a	 little	 courage	 and	 you	 can	 declare
yourself	a	buddha.	But	 the	mind	hesitates,	 the	mind	thinks	a	 thousand	and	one
things	--	what	will	happen	to	my	smoking?	What	about	the	girlfriend?	And	what
about	the	bank	balance?
These	small	things	I	allow	you	to	have.	You	can	be	a	buddha	and	smoke	--	that
will	 just	 simply	 show	 that	 you	 are	 a	 stupid	 buddha!	But	 stupid	 or	 not	 stupid,
nobody	 can	 take	 away	 your	 buddhahood.	 You	 can	 have	 a	 girlfriend	 --	 even
Sardar	Gurudayal	 Singh	 is	 having	 girlfriends	 and	 he	 is	 a	well-known	 buddha,
ancient.	I	don't	think	he	himself	knows	how	old	he	Osho	-	The	Miracle
68
Chapter	5	-	You	must	see	for	yourself
is!	But	there	is	no	time	for	him	to	get	old.	Girlfriends	continuously	keep	him	so
engaged,	he	has	no	time	to	grow	old.	One	needs	time	to	grow	old.
I	 allow	you	every	concession	 that	you	want	 except	unawareness;	 that	 I	 cannot
allow	because	that	is	fundamental	to	buddhahood.	If	you	are	alert	and	aware	and
conscious	 there	 is	no	need	of	any	master.	Universal	 energy	 itself	 transmits	 the
light,	 the	arrow	that	penetrates	 to	your	very	center,	and	you	become	connected
with	the	whole.
A	master	is	a	small	window	from	which	you	can	see	the	starry	sky.	But	that	does
not	mean	 that	 first	you	need	a	window,	only	 then	you	can	see	 the	starry	night.
Why	don't	you	come	out	of	the	door?
Mulla	Nasruddin	died	...	his	grave	still	exists	in	Iran.	He	used	to	carry	his	door
wherever	he	would	go,	and	people	would	ask,	"What	is	the	matter?	Why	are	you
carrying	that	board?
Have	you	become	a	Christian?"	But	even	Christ	was	carrying	only	the	cross,	not
a	board.	"Is	it	some	improvement	on	the	cross?"
He	 said	 "No,	 it	 is	 just	 a	 security	 measure.	 Nobody	 can	 enter	 into	 my	 house
except	through	the	door.	So	I	carry	the	door."
When	he	died	his	disciples	wondered	what	 to	do	about	 the	door.	He	had	 left	a
written	will	 in	which	he	mentioned	 it:	 "Just	put	 the	door	 in	 front	of	my	grave,
lock	it	and	put	the	keys	in	my	hand	inside	the	grave."
They	are	still	there,	the	door	and	the	grave;	and	the	skeleton	must	have	the	keys.
He	is	saying,	"If	the	door	is	closed	and	the	keys	are	with	me,	nobody	can	disturb
my	sleep	until	the	judgment	day,	nobody	can	enter	into	the	grave."	He	has	taken
security	measures.	Even	after	death,	the	door	is	locked.	You	may	think	it	seems
to	be	utter	foolishness,	but	the	man	was	laughing	about	you	in	all	his	acts,	all	his
statements.
This	act	is	also	simply	laughing	at	your	stupidity.	What	do	you	think	about	your
security,	your	bank	balance?	You	can	go	bankrupt.	What	do	you	 think	of	your
security,	your	husband,	your	wife?	If	either	of	you	is	intelligent	enough,	he	will
escape.
There	 is	no	 security.	Even	 if	 you	carry	 the	door	 there	 is	no	 security;	 in	 fact	 it
makes	 you	 more	 vulnerable.	 Thieves	 don't	 bother	 about	 entering	 through	 the
door.	In	fact	they	never	enter	through	the	door;	they	just	make	a	hole	in	the	wall
on	their	own	accord.
But	the	most	hilarious	part	is	...	one	cold	winter	night	a	thief	entered	into	Mulla
Nasruddin's	house.	Mulla	Nasruddin	opened	one	eye	and	looked	at	the	thief.	The
thief	started	trembling	--	a	man	asleep	with	one	eye	open?	Now	he	can	neither
go	 in,	 nor	 even	 get	 out.	 He	 was	 so	 much	 afraid,	 but	 Mulla	 said,	 "Don't	 be
worried,	I'm	coming	with	you."
He	said,	"Where?"
Mulla	said,	"Into	the	house	where	you	are	going."
The	thief	said,	"You	seem	to	be	mad!	I	am	a	thief!"
Mulla	 said,	 "I	 don't	 care	 who	 you	 are.	 For	 thirty	 years	 I	 have	 been	 looking
around	in	this	house,	and	I	haven't	found	anything.	Now	let	us	have	a	partnership
--	whatever	 is	 found	we	 split	 fifty-fifty.	You	came	at	 the	 right	 time,	because	 I
was	becoming	discouraged."
The	thief	said,	"My	God!"
Osho	-	The	Miracle
69
Chapter	5	-	You	must	see	for	yourself
But	he	had	to	go	in,	and	there	was	nothing.	Mulla	followed	him	with	his	lamp	to
show	him	 the	way	 everywhere.	The	 thief	wanted	 to	 escape	 somehow,	because
with	the	lamp	Mulla	would	see	his	face.	Tomorrow	the	whole	city	would	know
that	he	is	a	thief.
Mulla	 said,	 "Don't	 be	worried,	 that's	why	 I	 had	 opened	 only	 one	 eye.	 I'm	 not
looking	at	you.	My	concern	is	our	partnership."
He	said,	"What	partnership?	There	is	nothing	to	be	found."
He	said,	"That's	what	I	was	trying	to	tell	you,	but	you	wouldn't	listen."
The	thief	said,	"I	want	to	go!"
Nasruddin	said,	"Where?"
"I'm	going	to	my	house."
Nasruddin	said,	"I'm	also	coming.	Partners	should	live	together!"
The	thief	said,	"My	God,	this	is	a	difficulty.	I	have	a	wife."
Nasruddin	said,	"Don't	be	worried	about	that,	I	will	take	care	of	her.	You	just	do
your	job	and	I	will	take	care	of	your	wife."
This	man	whose	house	was	empty	was	carrying	the	door	all	around,	wherever	he
was	 going,	 making	 a	 statement	 in	 his	 own	 way.	 The	 man	 was	 of	 immense
intelligence.	 He	 is	 saying	 that	 it	 is	 only	 a	 door	 and	 nothing	 else.	 Just	 look
through	the	door	and	the	whole	sky	is	open.	By	carrying	the	door	he	was	saying
that	he	is	a	master,	a	door	to	the	divinity.	But	he	was	a	unique	person.
Dogen	is	still	a	scholar.	I	wonder	how	he	could	not	see	the	simple	point	when	he
said:	 WITHOUT	 THE	 PERSONAL	 TRANSMISSION,	 NOT	 A	 SINGLE
PATRIARCH,	 MASTER	 OR	 DISCIPLE,	 COULD	 BE	 A	 BUDDHA	 OR	 A
PATRIARCH.
What	about	 the	 first	buddha?	And	 if	 it	can	happen	 to	Gautam	Buddha	without
any	master,	why	can	it	not	happen	to	anybody	else?
To	 become	 enlightened	 is	 everybody's	 birthright,	 it	 is	 not	 a	 monopoly	 of
Buddha's.	These	statements	show	that	Dogen	is	still	learning	scriptures.	He's	not
a	buddha	yet.
He	became	a	buddha	finally,	after	he	had	gone	unnecessarily	astray	carrying	the
load	of	Buddhist	 scriptures.	Finally,	when	he	got	 finished	 and	 fed	up	with	 the
scriptures	 and	 dropped	 them,	 he	 was	 surprised	 to	 realize	 that	 from	 the	 very
beginning	there	was	no	need	to	search.
You	are	it.	The	seeker	is	the	goal.	If	you	go	on	seeking	other	goals,	you	are	going
away	from	yourself.	Seeking	has	to	stop.
IT	 IS	 JUST,	 says	 Dogen,	 AS	 IF	 WE	 WERE	 MAKING	 INNUMERABLE
SMALL
RIVERS	 JOIN	A	GREAT	ONE,	OR	KEEPING	THE	LIGHT	FROM	GOING
OUT,	 MAKING	 COUNTLESS	 LIGHTS	 ONE	 AFTER	 ANOTHER:
EVENTUALLY,	THEY
BECOME	ONE.
Partly	 he	 is	 right,	 but	 only	 partly.	 But	 buddhas	 don't	make	 partial	 statements.
Their	statements	are	categorically	absolute.
AND	 THERE	 IS	 NO	GAP	 IN	 THE	 FUNCTION	OF	 THE	 TRANSMISSION
BETWEEN
MASTER	AND	DISCIPLE.

SO	 SUCCESSIVE	 PATRIARCHS	 SPENT	 THEIR	 DAILY	 LIFE	 FACE	 TO
FACE	WITH
SAKYAMUNI	BUDDHA	AND	WATCHED	BY	HIS	FACE.
Now	at	the	time	of	Dogen,	Sakyamuni	Gautam	Buddha	had	been	dead	for	fifteen
hundred	 years.	 What	 does	 he	 mean	 by	 living	 face	 to	 face	 with	 Sakyamuni
Buddha?	He	had	only	stone	statues,	utterly	dead.
In	my	village	there	was,	very	close	to	my	house,	a	temple	of	Shiva,	and	Shiva	is
represented	 with	 the	 Shivalinga.	 You	must	 have	 seen	 Shiva	 temples:	 just	 any
beautiful	round	stone	is	placed	and	that	is	Shivalinga,	which	means,	"The	prick
of	the	Lord	Shiva."	Now	the	devotees	of	Shiva	are	going	to	be	freaked,	but	what
can	I	do?	I'm	simply	translating	the	word
'Shivalinga'.
One	of	my	friends'	 father	 lived	 just	 in	front	of	 that	 temple,	and	he	was	a	great
devotee	of	Shiva.
I	told	him,	"You	are	wasting	your	time.	That	Shiva	is	absolutely	worthless."
He	said,	"What	do	you	mean?	You	are	hurting	my	religious	feelings."
I	 said,	 "That	 is	 going	 to	 be	 my	 profession	 my	 whole	 life.	 This	 is	 just	 the
beginning.	I	have	seen	rats	urinating	on	your	Shiva.	He	cannot	do	anything	to	the
rats,	what	is	he	going	to	do	for	you?"
He	was	so	angry	that	he	told	me,	"You	get	out	of	this	house!"
I	 said,	 "I	will	 get	 out,	whether	 you	 say	 it	 or	 not.	But	whenever	 you	go	 to	 the
temple	I	will	be	standing	there	by	your	side,	watching	your	stupidity.	I	will	not
say	a	single	word,	but	you	will	understand	why	I'm	standing	there."
He	said,	"You	are	a	strange	boy."
From	 that	 day,	 for	 almost	 six	months,	 I	 followed	 him	 regularly.	Whenever	 he
would	enter	 the	 temple	he	would	 look	all	around.	 I	was	able	 to	see	 the	 temple
from	my	house,	so	immediately	I	would	enter	and	stand	there	without	saying	a
word.
And	he	would	say,	"My	God,	have	you	come?"
I	 said,	 "It	 is	 better	 to	 stop	 this	 stupidity.	 Don't	 you	 see	 so	 many	 rats	 in	 this
temple?"
He	said,	"It	is	true.	And	it	is	also	true	that	I	have	seen	those	rats	urinating	over
the	Shiva.
But	this	is	just	a	statue,	a	representation,	a	symbol	of	the	real	Shiva."
I	said,	"Have	you	seen	the	real	Shiva?	Is	he	just	a	prick?"
He	said,	"Listen!	You	are	not	allowed	to	come	into	my	house	anymore!"
I	said,	"I	have	no	intention.	If	you	stop	coming	to	this	temple,	I	will	stop	coming
to	your	house.	 It	 is	an	agreement.	But	 if	you	come	 to	 this	 temple,	nobody	can
prevent	me	 coming	 to	 your	 house	 and	 provoking	 you.	 I	will	 do	 everything	 to
make	you	aware	that	you	are	being	very	idiotic."
He	said	to	his	son,	"You	drop	your	friendship	with	this	boy,	because	this	boy	is
going	 to	 spoil	 you.	 He's	 spoiling	me,	 because	 sometimes	 I	 start	 thinking	 that
perhaps	I	am	being	stupid.
On	all	rational	grounds	the	boy	is	right.	I	have	not	seen	Shiva,	and	I	have	never
bothered	about	the	meaning	of	Shivalinga."
Osho	-	The	Miracle
71
Chapter	5	-	You	must	see	for	yourself
He	said,	"You	have	started	coming	in	my	dreams."
I	said,	"If	you	prevent	me	coming	to	your	house,	then	that	is	the	only	way	I	can
wake	you	up."
The	old	man	finally	decided	not	to	go	to	this	temple.	He	went	to	another	temple,
but	that	was	a	temple	of	an	elephant	god.	What	difference	does	it	make?
Dogen	is	talking	about	Sakyamuni	Buddha	as	if	the	Buddha	is	alive	and	you	are
watching	him.
There	 are	 certainly	 more	 statues	 of	 Gautam	 Buddha	 in	 the	 world	 than	 of
anybody	 else.	 And	 his	 last	 statement	 before	 he	 died	 was,	 "Don't	 make	 any
statues	 of	me,	 because	 I	will	 not	 be	 in	my	 stone	 statues."	But	 just	 as	 nobody
listens	to	the	master	...
They	resisted	making	statues	for	three	hundred	years,	but	then	finally	they	gave
up.	 First	 they	 started	 worshipping	 the	 grave	 of	 Gautam	 Buddha,	 but	 it	 is	 not
much	 joy	 to	worship	 a	 grave.	 Then	 somebody	 suggested	worshipping	 the	 tree
under	which	Gautam	Buddha	became	enlightened.	That	was	a	better	idea,	a	tree
is	at	least	a	living	phenomenon	...	a	beautiful	tree	with	great	foliage.	But	after	all
a	tree	is	a	tree,	it	cannot	be	a	substitute	for	Gautam	Buddha.
Nothing	can	be	a	substitute	except	your	own	consciousness.
All	these	statements	made	by	Dogen	simply	show	that	he	does	not	know.
HOW	MANY	DAYS	THEY	HAD	PASSED,	 I	DON'T	KNOW.	WE	SHOULD
THINK
CALMLY	 AND	 BE	 GLAD	 OF	 THIS.	 THEIR	 EYE	 AND	 FACE	 ARE	 THE
BUDDHA'S
BECAUSE	 THEY	 MADE	 BOWS	 TO	 THE	 BUDDHA'S	 FACE	 AND
TRANSFERRED	HIS
EYE	INTO	THEIR	OWN,	AND	VICE	VERSA.
IT	IS	THROUGH	THE	TRANSMISSION	THAT	THE	EYE	AND	FACE	HAD
BEEN
INCESSANTLY	TRANSMITTED	TILL	NOW.
THERE	 IS	NO	GAP	 IN	THE	TRANSMISSION	BETWEEN	MASTER	AND
DISCIPLE,	 JUST	AS	ONE	VINE	COILS	ROUND	ANOTHER;	THAT	IS	TO
SAY,	WE	OPEN	OUR
EYES	 AND	 PRESENT	 THEM	 WITH	 THEMSELVES,	 THEY	 RECEIVE
THEMSELVES.
THE	SAME	CAN	ALSO	BE	SAID	OF	OUR	FACE,	MIND	AND	BODY.
I	said	 to	you	that	 it	 is	a	half	 truth.	It	 is	 true	 that	 if	you	are	 living	with	a	 living
master	 --	 not	 with	 a	 statue	 --	 then	 gazing	 into	 his	 eyes	 or	 just	 watching	 his
presence,	 his	 gestures,	 you	 will	 see	 how	 awareness	 functions.	 And	 as	 you
become	 more	 and	 more	 aware	 of	 your	 master,	 simultaneously	 you	 will	 be
becoming	aware	of	yourself.
The	master	finally	proves	to	be	a	mirror.	In	the	mirror	you	can	see	your	face	--
your	original	face,	not	the	painted	one	which	the	society	has	given	to	you.	You
can	see	your	original	heart	--	not	the	one	which	is	used	for	pumping	the	blood	in
the	body,	but	the	original	heart	which	is	hiding	behind	it.
Watching	 your	 master	 in	 his	 day-to-day	 life,	 something	 is	 transmitted.	 Some
energy,	some	light,	some	fragrance	reaches	to	you,	but	 it	cannot	happen	with	a
statue.
There	are	many	Buddhist	 temples	 in	China,	 in	 Japan,	 in	 India.	Buddhists	have
disappeared	from	India,	but	all	 the	beautiful	places	 like	Ajanta	are	nothing	but
Gautam	Buddha's	statues	in	different	postures:	sitting,	lying,	standing,	sleeping,
waking.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	5	-	You	must	see	for	yourself
And	in	China	Buddhists	have	done	an	almost	impossible	thing.	There	is	a	temple
which	is	called,	"The	Temple	of	Ten	Thousand	Buddhas."	A	whole	mountain	has
been	carved	into	ten	thousand	buddhas.	First	the	whole	mountainside	was	carved
into	big	caves.	Then	the	statues	were	carved	in	those	shaded	caves.	It	must	have
taken	 thousands	 of	 years	 for	 thousands	 of	 sculptors,	 and	 of	 very	 fine
potentialities,	because	the	statues	are	so	beautiful.
But	it	was	a	futile	effort.	In	the	time	you	can	carve	a	buddha	in	marble,	in	that
very	 time	 you	 can	 become	 a	 thousand	 times	 a	 buddha.	 So	 I	 consider	 it	 an
absolute	wastage	of	time.
UNLESS	A	DISCIPLE	SEES	HIS	MASTER,	HE	CANNOT	BE	SAID	TO	BE	A
DISCIPLE.
Obviously.	 Scholars	 are	 so	 foolish.	 If	 a	 disciple	 has	 not	 seen	 the	master,	 it	 is
obvious	that	he	is	not	a	disciple.	A	disciple	exists	only	in	reference	to	a	master.	A
master	can	be	alone,	he	is	not	dependent	on	disciples.	His	mastery	depends	only
on	his	own	awakening.	But	a	disciple	cannot	be	a	disciple	on	his	own	accord;	he
has	to	be	in	deep	trust,	in	love	with	someone	who	has	arrived	home.
He	is	saying	it	right,	but	he	does	not	seem	to	know	that	at	the	time	Buddha	had
already	 been	 dead	 for	 fifteen	 centuries	 --	 and	 now	 it	 is	 twenty-five	 centuries.
Dogen	cannot	be	a	disciple	of	Buddha.	All	the	Buddhists	are	living	in	the	fallacy
that	 they	 are	 disciples	 of	 Buddha.	 You	 need	 a	 living	 master	 to	 transmit	 the
radiation	that	wakes	up	your	sleeping	buddhahood.	No	statue	can	do	that.
THEREFORE,	 THEY	 COULD	DIRECTLY	 TOUCH	 THE	 BUDDHA'S	 FINE
FACE.
He	 is	 still	 talking	 about	 statues.	 No	 disciple	will	 dare	 to	 touch	Buddha's	 face
when	he	is	living.
The	East	knows	that	the	disciple's	reach	is	up	to	the	feet	of	the	master.	There	is	a
certain	science	in	it.	As	the	disciple	touches	the	master's	feet,	the	master	touches
the	disciple's	head;	it	becomes	a	circle.	From	the	feet	the	energy	moves	into	the
disciple	and	from	the	hand	the	energy	moves	into	the	disciple.	And	somewhere
at	 the	 center	 of	 the	 disciple's	 heart,	 the	master's	 energy	 creates	 enough	 fire	 to
wake	up	the	sleeping	potentiality	of	the	disciple.
It	is	not	just	a	gesture	of	gratitude	to	touch	the	feet	of	the	master.	It	has	a	subtle
science	 about	 it.	 But	 you	 can	TOUCH	THE	BUDDHA'S	 FINE	FACE	 only	 if
your	Buddha	 is	 a	 stone	 statue.	And	by	 the	way,	 I	 have	 to	 remind	you	 that	 the
face	of	 the	Buddha	 in	 the	 statues	 is	not	his.	Because	Buddha	was	born	on	 the
boundaries	of	Nepal	and	India,	most	probably	he	was	Nepalese	--	it	was	just	on
the	 boundary	 where	 the	 two	 countries	 meet	 --	 he	 cannot	 have	 this	 face	 that
appears	in	the	statues.
By	a	strange	coincidence,	when	his	statues	were	first	being	made,	Alexander	the
Great	 was	 visiting	 India.	 It	 was	 Alexander	 the	 Great's	 face	 that	 inspired	 the
sculptors.	Certainly	the	Greek	face	has	a	beauty	of	its	own,	and	Alexander	was
one	of	the	most	beautiful	men	the	earth	has	seen.	So	the	face	you	see	on	Buddha
is	not	even	his.
In	 those	days	 there	were	no	photographs,	 so	 it	was	very	easy	 to	put	anybody's
head	on	anybody	else's	body.	Even	 the	body	does	not	 seem	 to	be	Buddha's.	 It
seems	to	be	almost	seven	feet	tall;	Nepalese	are	not	that	tall.	Even	in	India	seven
feet	is	very,	very	rare.	Nor	was	Buddha	as	athletic	as	the	body	seems	to	be;	he
had	been	 in	continuous	self-torture	for	six	years,	 the	body	would	have	become
just	bones.

The	statue	is	absolutely	false.	And	by	touching	this	statue's	face,	you	cannot	get
any	transmission.	If	you	do	it	is	imagination,	it	is	hallucination.	You	are	deluding
yourself.
AT	THE	TIME	OF	THE	TRANSMISSION,	OUR	FACE	WILL	CHANGE
COMPLETELY.	THE	SKIN	ITSELF	WILL	BE	A	GREAT	MIRROR	OF	THE
BUDDHAS,	 WHICH	 HAS	 NO	 FLAW	 INSIDE	 OR	 OUT.	 THE	 GREAT
MIRROR	GIVES	THE
TRANSMISSION	TO	THE	GREAT	MIRROR	ITSELF.
Once	in	a	while	he	says	something	beautiful.	He	was	a	great	scholar	at	the	time
he	was	making	 these	 statements.	 It	 is	 true	 that	when	 the	 transmission	happens
between	a	master	and	a	disciple,	the	face	of	the	disciple	starts	changing	to	a	new
grace,	a	new	beauty,	a	new	compassion,	a	new	love,	a	new	joy,	a	new	dance.	He
starts	reflecting	his	master's	being	on	a	smaller	scale.
But	it	is	possible	only	if	the	master	is	alive.	I	am	against	all	statues	because	they
are	deceptive,	they	are	deluding	millions	of	people	who	may	have	been	seeking
and	searching	the	truth.	Every	milestone	shows	them	the	way	towards	a	temple
or	a	synagogue	or	a	mosque.	The	way	is	inwards,	not	outside.
A	 great	 Sufi	master	 is	 known	 to	 have	 gone	 through	 a	 great	 transmission.	 His
name	was	Junnaid.	He	was	the	master	of	al-Hillaj	Mansoor.	Al-Hillaj	Mansoor	is
more	known	to	the	world	because	he	was	crucified	just	like	Jesus,	but	in	a	more
cruel	way.	Part	by	part	he	was	cut	--	the	American	way,	in	installments.
Junnaid	was	a	very	poor	man.	And	it	is	said	that	unless	at	least	once	in	your	life
you	 make	 the	 pilgrimage	 to	 Mecca,	 where	 the	 stone	 Kaaba	 is	 representing
Mohammed's	place	 ...	 It	 is	 from	that	stone	 that,	 sitting	on	his	horse,	he	simply
went	 upwards	 to	 paradise	 and	 took	 his	 horse	 too.	 If	 you	 are	 an	 authentic
Mohammedan,	you	have	to	visit	that	place	at	least	once	in	your	lifetime.	So	even
the	poorest	Mohammedans	collect	money,	sell	their	houses,	their	farms,	because
it	is	an	absolute	necessity	that	before	they	die	they	must	go	to	Kaaba.
Junnaid	was	getting	old	and	he	was	very	poor,	so	he	collected	money	from	his
neighbors.
Nobody	 refused	 because	 the	 money	 was	 for	 the	 journey	 to	 Kaaba;	 and
everybody	is	told	that	if	you	support	a	Mohammedan	on	his	pilgrimage,	you	also
partake	 in	 the	virtue	of	 the	great	pilgrimage.	So	people	gave	him	money,	gave
him	some	food,	clothes,	so	that	he	could	go.	He	had	to	travel	...	but	people	were
surprised:	 the	next	day	he	was	back.	 It	was	expected	 that	he	would	be	back	 in
about	 six	months,	 three	months	going	 and	 three	months	 coming.	This	was	 too
quick!	 --	 people	 could	 not	 believe	 it.	 And	 also,	 he	 looked	 absolutely
transformed,	so	radiant,	so	blissful.
They	said,	"What	happened?"
Junnaid	said,	"Kaaba	itself	came	to	meet	me	outside	the	village."
They	 said,	 "This	 is	 sheer	 nonsense.	That	 big	 stone?"	 It	 is	 an	 asteroid	 that	 has
fallen	from	the	sky	...	huge.
They	asked	him,	"At	least	tell	us	in	detail	what	really	has	happened."
A	 Sufi	master,	 Bayazid,	was	 sitting	 under	 a	 tree	 at	 the	 crossroads	 outside	 the
village.
Junnaid	 asked	 him,	 "Which	 way	 should	 I	 go?	 I	 want	 to	 reach	 Kaaba	 at	 the
pilgrimage	time."
At	a	certain	time	every	year	Mohammedans	from	all	over	the	world	try	to	reach
Kaaba.
Osho	-	The	Miracle
74
Chapter	5	-	You	must	see	for	yourself
Bayazid	said,	"Nonsense!	Bring	out	all	your	money!"	And	he	said	 it	with	such
authority	that	poor	Junnaid	brought	all	the	money	that	he	had	gathered.
And	Bayazid	said,	"There	is	no	need	to	go	anywhere!	Just	make	the	seven	circles
around	me.	I	am	the	Kaaba!"
Junnaid	could	not	believe	it	at	first,	but	what	to	do?	The	man	was	so	...	his	eyes
were	so	penetrating,	his	presence	was	so	fragrant.	He	circled	him	seven	times,	as
Mohammedans	are	supposed	to	go	round	the	Kaaba	stone	seven	times.
And	 Bayazid	 said,	 "Now	 give	 me	 all	 the	 other	 provisions	 you	 have	 for	 the
journey	and	go	home!	Your	pilgrimage	is	complete."
He	could	feel	that	something	had	changed.	He	was	no	longer	the	old	person	who
had	come	just	a	few	minutes	before.	So	he	told	the	villagers,	"I	met	a	man	who
said,	'I	am	the	Kaaba!'
and	he	took	all	my	provisions	and	all	my	money	and	told	me	to	make	the	seven
rounds."	A	few	people	laughed.	Those	who	were	stupid	laughed,	but	those	who
were	 wise	 understood	 because	 they	 could	 see	 the	 transformation	 that	 had
happened.
It	 does	 not	 matter	 who	 the	 man	 was,	 but	 certainly	 the	 man	 was	 a	 man	 of
realization.	 Just	 going	 around	 him	 seven	 times,	 Junnaid	 himself	 became	 a
master.
But	it	cannot	happen	by	going	around	a	stone	seven	or	seven	hundred	or	seven
thousand	times.
THOSE	WHO	HAVE	 BEEN	 CORRECTLY	GIVEN	 EYES	 TRUE	 ENOUGH
TO	SEE
SAKYAMUNI	BUDDHA	PERSONALLY	...
Now	 what	 nonsense	 he's	 talking!	 Buddha	 has	 been	 dead	 for	 fifteen	 hundred
years,	there	is	no	way	now	to	personally	connect	with	him.	Yes,	you	can	connect
with	somebody	else	who	is	still	alive	and	has	the	same	taste	of	buddhahood.	But
he	is	not	talking	about	that,	he	is	talking	about	stone	buddhas.
EVERYONE,	 REGARDLESS	 OF	 SELF	 AND	 OTHERS,	 WHO	 SEES	 THE
CORRECT
TRANSMISSION	OR	THE	REAL	STUDY	OF	THIS	NEW	TRANSMISSION
OF	THE
TATHAGATA	SHOULD	PRESERVE	IT	CAREFULLY.
The	word	 'study'	 shows	 that	Dogen	 is	 still	 a	 student,	 a	 scholar,	 although	he	 is
talking	as	if	he	knows.	In	the	world	you	will	come	across	people	who	are	talking
about	God	as	if	they	know,	and	millions	of	people	believe	in	them.	It	seems	our
minds	 have	 lived	 so	 long	 in	 slavery	 that	 we	 have	 forgotten	 even	 to	 question.
Dogen	is	not	told	that	what	he	is	talking	about	is	sheer	nonsense.
A	fifteen-hundred-year	gap	cannot	be	 filled.	You	have	 to	 find	a	 living	buddha.
Of	course,	the	living	buddha	will	have	the	same	taste	and	the	same	blissfulness
and	the	same	aura	and	the	same	energy	as	the	original	Gautam	Buddha.	But	this
is	possible	only	with	a	living	master.
The	search	for	truth	is	basically	the	search	for	a	living	master.	It	is	very	rare	that
you	 can	 find	 the	way	without	 a	master.	But	 I	 allow	 the	 exception.	 I	 allow	 the
exception	because	I	myself	never	had	any	master.
I	 have	met	with	many	 so-called	masters,	 but	 they	 all	wanted	 to	get	 rid	of	me,
because	my	presence	was	such	a	danger	to	their	respectability.	I	raised	questions
that	they	could	not	answer.	Other	disciples	started	disappearing,	and	they	would
say,	"Please,	you	go	on	and	find	somebody	else;	don't	disturb	our	disciples.	They
never	 asked	 such	 questions	 before	 you	 came;	 now	 they	 have	 started	 asking
strange	questions	about	which	we	know	nothing."

There	are	around	the	world	many	who	pretend	that	they	know.	But	you	can	see
in	 their	 eyes,	 in	 their	 gestures,	 in	 their	 silences,	 in	 their	 words,	 whether	 they
know	or	they	are	just	tape	recorders,	quoting	scriptures.
It	is	not	very	difficult	--	just	scratch	a	little	bit	and	you	will	find	the	scholar	and
the	scripture.	They	cannot	transmit	truth,	they	cannot	help	you	to	open	the	door
to	existence;	they	can	only	create	faith	in	you	in	some	dead	god,	in	some	dead
prophet.	They	are	a	great	consolation,	but	a	consolation	is	not	a	revolution.
Consolation	is	very	dangerous.	It	prevents	you	from	searching	more,	it	prevents
you	from	searching	deeper.
A	Zen	poet	wrote:
I	INTEND	TO	TRANSMIT	IT	TO	YOU,
BUT	YOU	CANNOT	TAKE	IT.
YOU	MAY	YEARN	TO	IMITATE	ME,
NEITHER	CAN	THIS	SUCCEED.
IF	YOU	PURPOSELY	TURN	BACK,
YOU	ARE	THE	ONE	WHO	IS
MEDDLING;
IF	I	PART	WITH	YOU,	YOU	WOULD
THINK	ME	DESTITUTE	OF	SENTIMENTS.
These	are	words	of	a	master.	He's	saying,	"If	you	turn	away	on	your	own	you	are
missing	 an	 opportunity.	 If	 I	 turn	 you	 away,	 I'm	 not	 compassionate."	And	 it	 is
intrinsic	in	being	a	buddha	to	be	compassionate.
But	you	cannot	imitate	me	and	you	cannot	intend	to	have	it	transmitted	to	you;
nor	can	you	take	it.	It	is	not	something	which	can	be	given.	It	is	not	something
which	has	to	be	found	somewhere.	It	is	just	a	sleeping	buddha	waking	up,	just	as
every	morning	you	superficially	wake	up.	A	day	comes	when	you	wake	up	in	the
very	 innermost	 core	 of	 your	 being,	 and	 once	 that	 waking	 has	 happened	 you
never	lose	it.

OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
SEIGEN	SAID:
IF	 NOW	 YOU	 COMPREHEND	 IT,	 WHERE	 IS	 THAT	 WHICH	 YOU	 DID
NOT
COMPREHEND	 BEFORE?	 WHAT	 YOU	 WERE	 DELUDED	 ABOUT
BEFORE	IS	WHAT
YOU	ARE	NOW	ENLIGHTENED	ABOUT,	AND	WHAT	YOU	ARE	NOW
ENLIGHTENED	 ABOUT,	 IS	 WHAT	 YOU	 WERE	 DELUDED	 ABOUT
BEFORE.
THERE	 ARE	 ONLY	 TWO	 DISEASES:	 ONE	 IS	 RIDING	 AN	 ASS	 TO
SEARCH	FOR
THE	ASS;	THE	OTHER	IS	RIDING	AN	ASS	AND	BEING	UNWILLING	TO
DISMOUNT.
YOU	SAY	THAT	RIDING	AN	ASS	TO	SEARCH	FOR	THE	ASS	 IS	SILLY,
AND	THAT
HE	WHO	DOES	 IT	SHOULD	BE	PUNISHED.	THIS	 IS	A	VERY	SERIOUS
DISEASE.
BUT	 I	 TELL	 YOU,	 DO	 NOT	 SEARCH	 FOR	 THE	 ASS	 AT	 ALL.	 THE
INTELLIGENT
MAN,	 UNDERSTANDING	 MY	 MEANING,	 STOPS	 HIS	 ERROR	 OF
SEARCHING	FOR
THE	ASS,	AND	THUS	THE	DELUDED	STATE	OF	HIS	MIND	CEASES	TO
EXIST.
BUT	IF,	HAVING	FOUND	THE	ASS	ONE	IS	UNWILLING	TO	DISMOUNT,
THIS
DISEASE	IS	MOST	DIFFICULT	TO	CURE.	I	SAY	TO	YOU,	DO	NOT	RIDE
THE	ASS	AT
ALL.	 YOU	 YOURSELF	 ARE	 THE	 ASS.	 MOUNTAINS,	 RIVERS	 AND
PLAINS	ARE	ALL
THE	 ASS.	 WHY	 DO	 YOU	 RIDE	 ON	 IT?	 IF	 YOU	 RIDE,	 YOU	 CANNOT
CURE	YOUR
DISEASE.	 BUT	 IF	 YOU	 DO	 NOT	 RIDE,	 THE	 UNIVERSE	 IN	 ALL
DIRECTIONS
BECOMES	 ONE	 WIDE	 EXPANSE.	 WITH	 THESE	 TWO	 DISEASES
EXPELLED,	 NOTHING	 REMAINS	 TO	 AFFECT	 YOUR	 MIND.	 THIS	 IS
SPIRITUAL	CULTIVATION.
YOU	NEED	DO	NOTHING	MORE.
Maneesha,	Seigen	 is	 raising	a	very	 important	question.	And	he	not	only	 raises
the	question,	he	also	gives	 the	answer.	That	 is	 the	way	of	a	master.	To	 raise	a
question	is	very	easy,	but	to	give	the	right	answer	is	very	difficult,	because	the
right	answer	is	only	one.
Millions	of	questions	are	possible,	but	millions	of	answers	are	not	there.
Before	I	read	you	the	sutra,	I	would	like	to	tell	you	the	essence	of	it.	Because	it
is	old	Zen	language,	it	looks	complicated,	but	it	is	not.
All	 that	he	 is	saying	 is	 that	searching	for	 the	self	 is	 stupid.	 It	 is	a	disease,	and
almost	incurable.	But	if	by	chance	you	find	the	self	and	become	enlightened,	you
have	jumped	from	one	disease	to	another.
Your	enlightenment	is	not	a	cure.	Your	enlightenment	is	now	another	possession.
Now	you	will	be	bragging	about	it.	It	will	not	give	you	freedom	but	new	fetters	-
-	just	more	shiny,	more	beautiful,	more	up	to	date.
Osho	-	The	Miracle
82
Chapter	6	-	Cages	of	gold
Seigen	is	saying	that	you	have	to	be	free	from	ignorance	and	you	have	to	be	free
from	 enlightenment.	 This	 is	 called	 the	 lion's	 roar.	 Even	 enlightenment	 is	 not
going	to	be	his	imprisonment.	He	wants	the	whole	universe	without	any	limits.
An	enlightened	person	has	a	 tiny	 flame.	But	 if	 that	 tiny	 flame	makes	him	 feel
special,	greater	and	better	than	others,	it	has	already	become	a	fetter.	This	is	not
the	 great	 enlightenment.	 It	 is	 simply	 changing	 dark-colored	 chains	 for	 light-
colored	chains.	The	great	enlightenment	is	to	not	have	any	chains.
So	ultimately	the	enlightened,	the	awakened,	the	buddha,	drops	his	buddhahood
too.	He	becomes	 absolutely	ordinary	 and	 simple.	 In	his	 simplicity	 radiates	 the
whole	cosmos.	In	his	silence	is	contained	all	the	music	and	all	the	rainbows	and
all	the	flowers	possible.	He	is	himself	the	universe,	there	is	no	more	division.
Now	 he	 cannot	 distinguish	 between	 the	 ignorant	 and	 the	 enlightened.	 To	 him
now	 the	 whole	 universe	 is	 nothing	 but	 an	 immense	 enlightenment	 in	 which
everything	is	drowned.	A	greater	dance	is	not	possible.
Seigen	said:
IF	 NOW	 YOU	 COMPREHEND	 IT,	 WHERE	 IS	 THAT	 WHICH	 YOU	 DID
NOT
COMPREHEND	 BEFORE?	 WHAT	 YOU	 WERE	 DELUDED	 ABOUT
BEFORE	IS	WHAT
YOU	ARE	NOW	ENLIGHTENED	ABOUT,	AND	WHAT	YOU	ARE	NOW
ENLIGHTENED	 ABOUT,	 IS	 WHAT	 YOU	 WERE	 DELUDED	 ABOUT
BEFORE.
The	 object	 of	 your	 delusion	 and	 the	 object	 of	 your	 enlightenment	 remain	 the
same.	It	is	not	a	great	transformation	as	far	as	your	subjectivity	is	concerned.
THERE	 ARE	 ONLY	 TWO	 DISEASES	 ...	 Nobody	 in	 the	 whole	 history	 has
brought	the	issue	to	such	clarity.
THERE	 ARE	 ONLY	 TWO	 DISEASES:	 ONE	 IS	 RIDING	 AN	 ASS	 TO
SEARCH	FOR
THE	ASS;	THE	OTHER	IS	RIDING	AN	ASS	AND	BEING	UNWILLING	TO
DISMOUNT.
One	is	searching	for	enlightenment,	the	other	is	finding	it	and	not	relaxing.
As	you	bragged	about	your	so-called	 ignorant	knowledge,	now	you	brag	about
your	enlightenment.	But	your	ego	remains	the	same.	Get	down	from	the	ass!	Get
down	from	your	enlightenment	and	mix	with	the	simple	existence	that	is	eternal
and	immortal.	Don't	keep	yourself	apart.
The	 second	 disease	 is	more	 difficult.	 The	 first	 disease	 you	 yourself	wanted	 to
drop.	The	second	disease	is	difficult,	because	now	the	chains	are	made	of	gold.
To	drop	chains	of	gold	feels	as	if	you	are	dropping	your	beautiful	ornaments,	and
nobody	wants	to	drop	their	ornaments.	It	becomes	more	difficult	to	get	out	of	a
cage	made	of	gold	because	even	the	cage	seems	to	be	so	valuable.	And	what	is
there	beyond	 the	cage?	 Just	 an	empty	 sky	as	 far	 as	you	can	 see.	The	cage	not
only	makes	you	special,	it	also	gives	you	security.
Seigen	is	saying:
YOU	SAY	THAT	RIDING	AN	ASS	TO	SEARCH	FOR	THE	ASS	IS	SILLY	--
that	is	obvious	--	AND	THAT	HE	WHO	DOES	IT	SHOULD	BE	PUNISHED.
THIS	IS	A	VERY
SERIOUS	DISEASE.	BUT	I	TELL	YOU,	DO	NOT	SEARCH	FOR	THE	ASS
AT	ALL.	THE
INTELLIGENT	 MAN,	 UNDERSTANDING	 MY	 MEANING,	 STOPS	 HIS
ERROR	OF
SEARCHING	FOR	THE	ASS,	AND	THUS	THE	DELUDED	STATE	OF	HIS
MIND
CEASES	TO	EXIST.

Chapter	6	-	Cages	of	gold
This	 is	 how	 you	 can	 determine	 whether	 a	 man	 really	 knows.	 Even	 from	 his
words	you	can	see	some	glimpses.	Compare	it	with	Jesus'	statement,	"Seek	and
ye	shall	find."	Seigen	will	say,	"Seek	and	you	shall	never	find."
The	seeker	has	already	gone	away	from	himself;	in	search	of	himself	he	has	left
himself	far	behind.	Jesus	says,	"Ask	and	you	will	be	answered."	Who	is	there	to
answer?	 It	 is	 your	 own	mind	 game.	One	 part	 of	 the	mind	 raises	 the	 question,
another	part	of	 the	mind	supplies	 the	answer.	Otherwise	 this	whole	universe	 is
utterly	silent.
All	 prayers	 are	 in	 vain.	 And	 they	 don't	 show	 your	 religiousness,	 they	 simply
show	your	IQ
--	your	intelligence	quotient.	They	show	that	you	are	still	a	child,	 that	you	still
want	someone	else	to	take	the	responsibility.	There	is	nobody	in	the	sky	to	take
the	responsibility.	For	Jesus	 there	 is	a	God,	but	for	Seigen	and	any	Zen	master
there	is	no	God	to	answer.	You	are	the	answer	--	just	don't	ask!	Be	silent!	Don't
ask!	And	there	is	the	answer.
Jesus	says,	"Knock,	and	the	door	shall	be	opened	unto	you."	The	very	language
indicates	that	the	door	is	somewhere	outside	you	--	you	have	to	knock.	But	the
reality	is,	you	have	to	go	in.	There	is	no	question	of	knocking.	Stop	all	knocking
on	the	doors	outside	you!	Just	relax	into	your	center	and	you	have	found	it.	And
you	will	be	surprised	 that	you	were	searching	for	something	which	has	always
been	there	inside	you.
BUT	IF,	HAVING	FOUND	THE	ASS	ONE	IS	UNWILLING	TO	DISMOUNT,
THIS
DISEASE	IS	MOST	DIFFICULT	TO	CURE.
Only	a	master	can	say	 that	enlightenment	 is	also	a	disease.	Perhaps	a	better,	 a
cleaner	 disease.	But	 remember	 the	meaning	 of	 the	word	 disease	 --	 it	 does	 not
mean	sickness,	it	does	not	mean	illness,	it	simply	means	'dis-ease'.	And	to	be	at
ease	 with	 the	 universe	 you	 cannot	 think	 yourself	 enlightened	 and	 others
unenlightened.	To	be	at	ease	with	the	universe	you	have	to	dismount	from	your
enlightenment	and	just	be	simple	...	nobody.	And	the	whole	universe	is	yours.
I	SAY	TO	YOU,	DO	NOT	RIDE	THE	ASS	AT	ALL.
In	 the	 first	 place,	 riding	 the	 ass	 you	 are	 getting	 into	 difficulty.	 Don't	 seek
enlightenment,	because	that	will	ultimately	end	up	in	your	finding	it.	And	it	will
be	 very	 difficult	 for	 you	 to	 get	 free	 of	 enlightenment.	 It	 will	 become	 a	 new
disease,	a	new	imprisonment	--	so	cozy	and	so	special	for	the	ego	that	who	wants
to	just	be?	Dismount	from	it!	You	have	been	in	search	for	so	long	and	now	you
have	found.	Your	whole	search	...	you	have	invested	your	whole	life!
But	a	real	buddha,	a	man	of	existential	knowledge	will	say,	I	SAY	TO	YOU,	DO
NOT
RIDE	THE	ASS	AT	ALL!
YOU	YOURSELF	ARE	THE	ASS!
The	ass	is	just	a	symbol.
MOUNTAINS,	RIVERS	AND	PLAINS	ARE	ALL	THE	ASS.	WHY	DO	YOU
RIDE	ON
IT?	 IF	YOU	RIDE,	YOU	CANNOT	CURE	YOUR	DISEASE.	BUT	 IF	YOU
DO	NOT	 RIDE,	 THE	 UNIVERSE	 IN	 ALL	 DIRECTIONS	 BECOMES	 ONE
WIDE	EXPANSE.	WITH
THESE	 TWO	 DISEASES	 EXPELLED,	 NOTHING	 REMAINS	 TO	 AFFECT
YOUR	MIND.
THIS	IS	SPIRITUAL	CULTIVATION.	YOU	NEED	DO	NOTHING	MORE.
Enlightenment	is	the	last	disease,	the	last	barrier.
There	have	been	wise	friends	who	used	to	say	to	me,	"You	are	a	blessed	soul."
Osho	-	The	Miracle
84
Chapter	6	-	Cages	of	gold
I	 said	 to	 these	 people,	 "Don't	 make	 distinctions."	 Let	 me	 remain	 simply	 a
nobody,	with	no	power,	with	no	domination.	Because	every	subtle	desire	 to	be
special	is	a	desire	for	power.
You	 gather	 money	 to	 be	 powerful,	 you	 go	 into	 politics	 to	 be	 powerful,	 you
search	for	enlightenment	again	for	power.	Enlightened	you	will	be	worshipped.
Perhaps	enlightenment	is	the	most	dangerous	disease	of	all,	because	who	wants
to	be	unenlightened	once	he	has	become	enlightened?	--	except	my	people	who
become	enlightened	every	day.	They	never	tire	of	it;	the	next	day	again	they	are
here.
Gurudayal	Singh	 is	 laughing.	Because	he	 is	my	ancientmost	 sannyasin,	he	has
become	 so	 many	 times	 enlightened!	 But	 the	 next	 day	 when	 he	 wakes	 up	 he
thinks,	 "Enlightenment	 is	 not	 difficult.	 One	 can	 become	 enlightened	 any	way,
any	 day,	 any	 time.	 Just	 a	 little	 more	 enjoyment	 around	 the	 world	 --
enlightenment	can	wait!"
It	 is	 not	 something	 that	 is	 far	 away.	Once	 you	 have	 known	 it,	 you	 know	 it	 is
there.	Then	 just	 be	 ordinary,	 simple.	 In	 that	 simplicity	 is	 purity	 and	 joy	 and	 a
laughter	like	a	child;	and	a	glory	and	a	splendor	that	the	whole	existence	pours
on	such	innocence.
A	Zen	haiku:
EVERY	MAN	HAS	BENEATH	HIS	FEET,
GROUND	ENOUGH	TO	DO	ZAZEN	ON.
You	 don't	 have	 to	 go	 anywhere.	Wherever	 you	 are,	 you	 have	 enough	 ground
under	your	feet	and	you	can	become	enlightened.	You	can	do	the	meditation,	it
does	not	have	to	be	in	a	certain	holy	place.
But	even	people	like	Moses	would	not	pass	the	test	set	by	this	haiku	poet.	When
Moses	went	to	meet	God	on	Mount	Sinai	...	In	the	first	place	the	whole	idea	of
meeting	God	is	absolutely	imagination.	He	must	have	been	asleep.	In	a	dream	he
must	have	gone	up	the	mountain,	because	thousands	of	people	have	gone	to	the
mountain	before	and	after,	and	God	has	never	been	found	there.	Still	people	go
on	thinking	that	it	is	a	holy	place.	It	was	a	special	concession	to	Moses	that	God
met	 him	 on	Mount	 Sinai.	 It	 is	 strange	 how	 he	 knew	 that	 he	would	 be	 at	 that
moment	 on	 Mount	 Sinai.	 He	 had	 no	 phone	 call	 from	 him,	 no	 letter,	 no
communication	 of	 any	 kind.	 But	 he	 met	 God	 on	 Sinai	 --	 that's	 what	 the	 Old
Testament	says.
As	a	metaphor	 it	 is	beautiful,	but	 religions	 turn	every	metaphor	 into	 factuality,
and	then	it	becomes	a	superstition.
Moses	approaches	God	...	and	what	is	God?	A	fire	is	burning	inside	a	green	bush
and	the	bush	is	still	green.	Flames	are	coming	out	of	the	bush	just	like	branches,
flowers.	With	those	flowers	and	branches	and	leaves	the	flames	are	coming	out.
This	 can	 be	 a	 beautiful	 metaphor,	 that	 life	 is	 nothing	 but	 fire.	 But	 as	 he
approached	the	bush,	somebody	shouted	from	the	bush,
"Moses	take	off	your	shoes!	You	are	on	holy	ground."
These	kinds	of	metaphors	have	proved	to	be	very	dangerous.	It	is	beautiful	to	see
God	 as	 flames	 ...	 certainly	 cool,	 because	 they	 are	 not	 burning	 the	 leaves,	 the
flowers,	 the	 bush.	 On	 the	 contrary	 they	 are	 nourishing	 it,	 dancing	 with	 its
branches.	 But,	 "Take	 off	 your	 shoes,	 this	 is	 holy	 ground,"	 is	 a	 dangerous
statement.	That	means	other	ground	is	not	holy.
This	 Zen	master	 says,	 EVERY	MAN	HAS	BENEATH	HIS	 FEET,	GROUND
ENOUGH
TO	DO	ZAZEN	ON.	You	don't	have	to	go	to	Sinai	or	to	Kaaba	or	to	Kashi,	you
don't	have	to	Osho	-	The	Miracle
85
Chapter	6	-	Cages	of	gold
go	 anywhere.	Wherever	 you	 are,	 you	 are	 in	 the	 holy	 universe.	 There	 are	 not
certain	places	which	are	holy	and	certain	places	which	are	not	holy.	If	the	whole
universe	is	divine	then	everything	is	holy.
Another	haiku:
THE	BAMBOO	SHADOWS	ARE	SWEEPING	THE	STAIRS,
BUT	NO	DUST	IS	STIRRED:
THE	MOONLIGHT	PENETRATES	DEEP
INTO	THE	BOTTOM	OF	THE	POOL,
BUT	NO	TRACE	IS	LEFT	IN	THE	WATER.
Saying	 things	which	 cannot	 be	 said,	Zen	 has	 such	 a	 unique	way	of	 indicating
aesthetically	 that	 it	 seems	unbelievable.	The	master	 is	 saying,	THE	BAMBOO
SHADOWS	 ...	 not	 the	bamboos	 themselves,	because	bamboos	are	clumsy	and
they	will	make	much	noise.	THE
BAMBOO	SHADOWS	ARE	 SWEEPING	THE	 STAIRS,	 BUT	NO	DUST	 IS
STIRRED.
This	is	our	actual	situation.	In	our	innermost	consciousness	no	dust	is	stirred.	All
our	thoughts	are	nothing	but	bamboo	shadows.
THE	 MOONLIGHT	 PENETRATES	 DEEP	 INTO	 THE	 BOTTOM	 OF	 THE
POOL,	BUT
NO	TRACE	IS	LEFT	IN	THE	WATER.
When	you	become	aware	you	are	surprised	...	all	your	actions	in	the	past,	your
thoughts	 in	 the	 past	 --	 nothing	 has	 left	 any	 trace.	 Awakened,	 you	 are	 left
completely	silent	as	if	there	has	been	no	past	at	all.	Just	like	in	the	morning	when
you	 wake	 up,	 just	 for	 two	 or	 three	 minutes	 you	 remember	 the	 last	 part	 of	 a
dream.	You	have	been	dreaming	the	whole	night,	six	hours.	If	you	are	sleeping
eight	hours,	then	six	hours	you	have	been	dreaming.	But	when	you	wake	up	you
remember	just	the	last	dream,	and	that	too	only	when	you	are	half	asleep	and	you
can	feel	it.	When	you	are	really	awake	no	trace	remains	of	any	dreams.
This	was	 the	 reason	why	 the	mystics	 called	 the	world	 just	 a	 dream.	All	 your
desires,	all	your	possessions,	all	your	thoughts,	all	your	religions,	all	your	anger,
love	and	hate	--
everything	that	makes	up	your	world,	your	mind,	is	found	to	be	as	if	it	has	never
been	there.
When	you	wake	up,	you	are	absolutely	a	clean	slate.	Nobody	has	ever	written
anything	on	it.
Another	Zen	master:
IF	YOU	WISH	TO	KNOW	THE	ROAD
UP	THE	MOUNTAIN,	YOU	MUST	ASK	THE	MAN
WHO	GOES	BACK	AND	FORTH	ON	IT.
A	 man	 who	 has	 become	 enlightened	 has	 reached	 to	 the	 highest	 peak	 of	 the
mountain,	and	 then	he	comes	down	and	becomes	a	simple	man.	He	knows	 the
peak	is	there,	it	is	his	own	being.	If	you	want	to	ask,	ask	a	man	who	has	been	to
the	mountain	and	has	come	down.	If	he	Osho	-	The	Miracle
86
Chapter	6	-	Cages	of	gold
is	still	on	the	mountain	your	question	will	not	be	answered.	If	he	is	still	on	the
way	going	towards	the	mountain	all	that	he	can	say	will	be	mere	words.
You	have	to	find	a	man	who	has	been	to	the	ultimate	peak	and	then	came	down
to	be	amongst	you.	Then	he	 is	at	ease,	he	has	no	 tensions,	he	 is	at	home.	Ask
such	a	person,	perhaps	he	may	indicate	the	way.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
NONE	OF	THE	MASTERS	WHOSE	SERMONS	WE	HAVE	BEEN	HEARING
ARE	A	PATCH	ON	YOU.	IT'S	NOT	JUST	THAT	YOU	ARE	AS	GREAT	AS
ONE	WOULD
EXPECT	 THIS	 FAR	 DOWN	 THE	 LINE;	 AND	 I'M	 SURE	 IT'S	 NOT	 JUST
BECAUSE	YOU
ARE	MY	MASTER:	 YOU	 ARE	 A	 QUANTUM	 LEAP	 AWAY	 FROM	 ANY

BE

BELOVED	MASTER,	JUST	EXACTLY	WHO	ARE	YOU?
Maneesha,	I	don't	know.
I	will	 tell	you	a	few	jokes.	Perhaps	you	may	find	something	of	me.	A	smile,	a
laughter,	a	shadow	of	the	bamboos,	a	moon	reflected	in	the	river	...	but	leaving
no	trace	behind.
Kowalski	is	standing	on	the	train	platform	and	he	sees	Paddy	waving	goodbye	to

was	a	great	screw!	Good-bye!"
Kowalski	is	stunned.	He	walks	over	to	Paddy	and	asks,	"Hey	Paddy,	did	I	hear
you	correctly?	Did	you	just	tell	that	guy	that	his	wife	was	a	great	screw?"

"Sorry,"	she	says,	and	climbs	back	on.	But	she	farts	in	his	face	again.
"Holy	Jesus,"	shouts	the	priest,	as	he	jumps	up	off	the	bed.
"What's	the	matter?"	asks	Sally.
"Well,"	 replies	Finger.	 "I	want	 to	know	about	 sex,	 but	 I	 don't	 think	 I	 can	 take

Rejoice	in	it.	Remember	it.
Slowly	slowly
it	is	going	to	become	an	undercurrent
running	twenty-four	hours
in	all	your	activities,
transforming	your	actions,
your	individuality,	your	responses,
giving	you	a	new	birth.
It	is	from	this	place	buddhas	have	arisen.
Sink	deep	in	the	experience.
Drink	as	much	as	possible.
Every	cell,	every	nerve	of	you,
should	be	drenched	with	buddhahood.
It	is	your	nature.

Come	back.
But	slowly,	silently	...

Sit	for	a	few	minutes
knowing	that	you	are	the	Buddha.

of	being	courageous	and	declaring	to	yourself
that	you	have	found	your	home.
You	don't	need	anybody's	certificate.

OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
RINZAI	SAID:
IF	 YOU	 WANT	 TO	 BE	 COMFORTABLY	 INDEPENDENT,	 FREE	 FROM
BIRTH	AND
DEATH	AND	 FREE	TO	GO	OR	 STAY,	YOU	 SHOULD	RECOGNIZE	 THE
ONE	WHO	IS
HERE	NOW	LISTENING	TO	MY	EXPOUNDING	OF	THE	DHARMA.	THIS
ONE	HAS
NEITHER	FORM	NOR	SHAPE	AND	NEITHER	ROOTS	NOR	BRANCHES;
THIS	ONE
HAS	NO	PLACE	OF	ABODE;	AND	THIS	ONE	 IS	LIVELY	AND	ACTIVE
AND
PERFORMS	 ITS	 FUNCTION	 ACCORDING	 TO	 CIRCUMSTANCES
BEYOND	ALL
CONCEPTIONS	 OF	 LOCATION.	 IF	 YOU	 SEARCH	 FOR	 HIM,	 HE	 WILL
FLEE	AWAY
FROM	YOU,	AND	IF	YOU	LONG	FOR	HIM,	HE	WILL	OPPOSE	YOU.	SO
HE	IS
CALLED	THE	MYSTERIOUS	ONE.
IF	 YOU	 GIVE	 RISE	 TO	 A	 THOUGHT	 OF	 LOVE	 IN	 YOUR	MIND,	 YOU
WILL	BE
DROWNED	BY	WATER.	IF	YOU	GIVE	RISE	TO	A	THOUGHT	OF	ANGER
IN	YOUR
MIND,	 YOU	 WILL	 BE	 BURNED	 BY	 FIRE.	 IF	 YOU	 GIVE	 RISE	 TO	 A
THOUGHT	OF
DOUBT	 IN	YOUR	MIND,	YOU	WILL	BE	OBSTRUCTED	BY	EARTH.	 IF
YOU	GIVE
RISE	 TO	 A	 THOUGHT	 OF	 JOY,	 YOU	 WILL	 BE	 WHIRLED	 AWAY	 BY
WIND.
IF	 YOU	CAN	DISCERN	ALL	 THIS	YOU	WILL	NOT	BE	AFFECTED	BY
OBJECTIVE
THINGS	WHICH	YOU	CAN	TURN	TO	YOUR	OWN	ADVANTAGE.	THEN
YOU	CAN
WALK	 ON	 WATER	 AS	 IF	 ON	 THE	 GROUND,	 AND	 WALK	 ON	 THE
GROUND	AS	IF
ON	 WATER.	 WHY	 IS	 THIS	 POSSIBLE?	 --	 BECAUSE	 YOU	 ALREADY
UNDERSTAND
THAT	 THE	 FOUR	 ELEMENTS	 ARE	 LIKE	 A	 DREAM	 AND	 A
TRANSFORMATION.
THEREFORE,	 FOLLOWERS	 OF	 THE	 WAY,	 THE	 ONE	 WHO	 IS	 NOW
LISTENING
TO	 MY	 EXPOUNDING	 OF	 THE	 DHARMA	 IS	 CERTAINLY	 NOT	 YOUR
FOUR
ELEMENTS,	 BUT	 ONE	 WHO	 CAN	 MAKE	 USE	 OF	 YOUR	 FOUR
ELEMENTS.	IF	YOU
HOLD	SUCH	A	VIEW,	YOU	WILL	THEN	BE	FREE	TO	GO	OR	STAY.
Maneesha,	 one	of	 the	most	 important	 things	 to	be	understood	 is	 that	 language
goes	 on	 changing	with	 time.	What	 looked	very	 significant	 one	 thousand	years
ago	will	not	look	very	significant	now.	What	was	thought	to	be	very	profound	in
the	times	of	Gautam	Buddha	will	be	thought	to	be	childish	today.
Talking	 on	 these	 ancient	 masters	 I	 am	 in	 a	 constant	 difficulty	 because	 their
language	does	not	fit	with	contemporary	intelligence.	I	have	to	bring	the	essence
into	a	contemporary	context,	otherwise	it	will	 look	just	mythological	 ...	 talking
about	nonsense.	Perhaps	it	was	possible	for	the	primitive	man	not	to	object	to	it,
but	for	the	modern	mind	it	is	impossible	not	to	object.
Osho	-	The	Miracle
91
Chapter	7	-	The	mysterious	one
The	master's	whole	position	 should	be	 such	 that	 your	 trust	 deepens	 and	 is	 not
disturbed.	 If	 the	master	 disturbs	your	 trust	 he	 is	 taking	you	 farther	 away	 from
yourself,	because	your	undisturbed	being	 --	 settled,	 centered,	 at	home	 --	 is	 the
realization	of	truth.
So	I	have	to	be	very	careful	with	all	these	old	masters.	They	use	the	language	of
their	times.	It	was	perfectly	right	then,	and	today	the	essence	is	perfectly	right,
but	 the	 language	 is	 no	more	 relevant.	 It	 is	 true	 about	 all	 the	masters	 I	will	 be
speaking	 to	 you	 about.	 It	 is	 not	 only	 about	 Rinzai;	 I	 will	 tell	 you	 where	 it
becomes	difficult	for	the	contemporary	intelligence.
RINZAI	SAID:
IF	 YOU	 WANT	 TO	 BE	 COMFORTABLY	 INDEPENDENT,	 FREE	 FROM
BIRTH	AND
DEATH	AND	 FREE	TO	GO	OR	 STAY,	YOU	 SHOULD	RECOGNIZE	 THE
ONE	WHO	IS
HERE	NOW	LISTENING	TO	MY	EXPOUNDING	OF	THE	DHARMA.
In	a	simpler	way,	what	he	is	saying	is:	"Don't	be	concerned	with	what	I	say,	but
be	concerned	with	who	is	listening	in	you.	It	does	not	matter	what	I	am	saying.
What	matters	is	that	you	are	awake	and	listening."	Listening	is	a	great	art.	Just
experience	the	listener,	and	you	will	not	go	astray.
Particularly	Zen	masters	want	you	to	be	free	from	birth	and	death.	That	is	not	the
case	with	other	so-called	religions.	Most	of	the	religions	prevalent	in	the	world
begin	with	birth	and	end	with	death.	The	East	has	concentrated	its	genius	on	a
single	point:	to	search	where	we	were	before	we	were	born,	and	whether	we	are
going	to	survive	death.
And,	without	any	exception,	the	extraordinary	conclusion	that	has	been	found	is
that	 if	 we	 go	 deep	 enough	 into	 ourselves,	 there	 is	 a	 space	 which	 is	 eternal,
immortal.	It	knows	nothing	of	birth,	nothing	of	death.	It	is	simply	a	traveler	--	an
eternal	 traveler.	 It	 is	 an	explorer	of	different	 forms,	different	ways	of	being.	 It
has	been	in	a	 tree	and	blossomed	into	flowers;	 it	has	been	in	a	 lion	and	roared
like	a	 lion;	 it	has	been	 throughout	 the	universe	 in	different	 forms.	 It	 is	 a	great
journey.	If	you	can	see	the	variety	of	the	experiences	...
Man	is	at	a	point	from	where	he	can	either	continue	the	journey	into	forms,	or	he
can	 jump	 out	 of	 the	 circle	 of	 birth	 and	 death	 and	 merge	 into	 the	 universe	 --
losing	his	individuality,	becoming	one	with	the	cosmos.
It	is	possible	only	for	man.	That	is	his	dignity.	But	many	human	beings	will	not
use	this	opportunity	to	jump	into	the	universal	soul	and	dissolve	themselves.
Rinzai	is	saying:
IF	 YOU	 WANT	 TO	 BE	 COMFORTABLY	 INDEPENDENT,	 FREE	 FROM
BIRTH	AND
DEATH	AND	 FREE	TO	GO	OR	 STAY,	YOU	 SHOULD	RECOGNIZE	 THE
ONE	WHO	IS
HERE	NOW	LISTENING	TO	MY	EXPOUNDING	OF	THE	DHARMA.
We	have	to	bring	the	statement	to	this	moment.	Who	is	listening	to	me?	Is	it	just
your	mind?	If	it	is	just	your	mind	it	is	not	going	to	transform	your	being.	If	you
are	listening	with	silence,	then	you	are	listening	with	the	heart.	That	is	going	to
transform	your	 being.	The	heart	 simply	gets	 the	 essential	message.	Mind	only
gets	the	words,	and	the	message	is	between	the	words.	Only	the	heart	is	capable.
And	if	you	go	even	deeper,	then	your	being	is	there.	Heart	is	a	door	towards	your
being,	and	your	being	is	the	opening	towards	the	universal	being.
Listening	to	a	master	is	not	necessary.	You	can	listen	to	the	wind	passing	through
the	pine	trees;	with	the	same	silence	you	can	listen	to	the	music	of	Mozart,	you
can	listen	to	the	birds.
The	whole	universe	is	expounding	the	Dharma.	Just	the	listener	is	missing.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	7	-	The	mysterious	one
The	art	of	meditation
is	the	art	of	listening	with	your	total	being.
This	very	moment,	in	this	silence,
your	boundaries	drop,
your	defenses	drop.
You	become	one	whole.
There	are	not	ten	thousand	people,
but	just	one	ocean	of	consciousness.
Just	listen	so	deeply	that	you	disappear,
and	only	the	essential	and	the	eternal	in	you
remains.
THIS	ONE	 --	 the	 listener	 --	HAS	NEITHER	FORM	NOR	SHAPE	 --	 space	 --
AND
NEITHER	 ROOTS	 NOR	 BRANCHES;	 THIS	 ONE	 HAS	 NO	 PLACE	 OF
ABODE;	AND
THIS	 ONE	 IS	 LIVELY	 AND	 ACTIVE	 AND	 PERFORMS	 ITS	 FUNCTION
ACCORDING
TO	CIRCUMSTANCES	BEYOND	ALL	CONCEPTIONS	OF	LOCATION.	 IF
YOU
SEARCH	 FOR	 HIM,	 HE	WILL	 FLEE	 AWAY	 FROM	 YOU,	 AND	 IF	 YOU
LONG	FOR
HIM,	 HE	 WILL	 OPPOSE	 YOU.	 SO	 HE	 IS	 CALLED	 THE	 MYSTERIOUS
ONE.
A	 very	 great	 statement.	 Such	 statements	 come	 only	 rarely	 in	 the	world.	 They
make	the	mystic	a	miracle.	What	he	is	saying	is:	if	you	try	to	seek	it,	you	will	not
find	it,	because	it	 is	not	an	object.	Secondly,	 if	you	try	to	find	it	you	are	being
very	foolish,	because	it	is	within	you;	the	seeker	himself	is	the	sought.	Once	you
start	seeking	it	somewhere	else	you	are	going	on	wrong	paths,	of	which	there	are
thousands.	There	is	only	one	path	which	is	the	right	path,	and	on	the	right	path
you	have	not	to	go	anywhere,	but	to	remain	home.
Just	 be	 --	 no	 search,	 no	 desire,	 no	 longing.	 And	 in	 that	 silent	 and	 peaceful
moment	 there	 is	a	possibility	you	will	 find	your	buddha.	 It	 is	 there,	but	 if	you
start	looking	for	him	here	and	there	you	are	going	to	be	a	failure.	Search	for	him,
he	will	flee	away.	And	if	you	long	for	him	he	will	oppose	you.	Neither	seek	nor
desire	 nor	 long	 --	 just	 be	 at	 ease.	 You	 are	 already	 it!	 You	 don't	 need	 any
improvement,	 any	 refinement,	 and	 you	 don't	 need	 to	 go	 somewhere	 else.	And
you	 don't	 have	 to	 become	 somebody	 else;	 as	 you	 are,	 existence	 is	 expressing
itself	 in	you	with	all	 its	glory.	Don't	go	anywhere,	and	don't	 long	for	anything,
because	everything	is	already	given	to	you.
Because	of	this	situation	Rinzai	says:
SO	HE	IS	CALLED	THE	MYSTERIOUS	ONE.
The	mystery	is:	if	you	seek	it,	you	will	never	find	it.	And	if	you	long	for	it,	you
are	lost.
Just	no	seeking,	no	longing,	no	desire;	sitting	at	ease,	becoming	more	and	more
settled	and	centered,	and	you	have	it	--	because	you	are	it.
IF	 YOU	 GIVE	 RISE	 TO	 A	 THOUGHT	 OF	 LOVE	 IN	 YOUR	MIND,	 YOU
WILL	BE
DROWNED	BY	WATER.	IF	YOU	GIVE	RISE	TO	A	THOUGHT	OF	ANGER
IN	YOUR
MIND,	 YOU	 WILL	 BE	 BURNED	 BY	 FIRE.	 IF	 YOU	 GIVE	 RISE	 TO	 A
THOUGHT	OF
DOUBT	IN	YOUR	MIND,	YOU	WILL	BE	OBSTRUCTED	BY	EARTH.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	7	-	The	mysterious	one
Just	metaphors.	All	that	he	is	saying	is:	any	rise	of	thought	in	you,	and	you	have
missed	the	point.	A	single	thought	is	an	obstruction	to	your	inner	space.	It	takes
you	away.	Whether	it	is	a	thought	of	love	or	mind	or	anger	or	greed	--	it	does	not
matter	what	 the	 quality	 of	 the	 thought	 is.	 It	may	 be	 a	 good	 thought	 or	 a	 bad
thought,	 a	 very	 saintly	 thought	 or	 a	 very	 unsaintly	 one	 --	 it	 does	 not	 matter.
Thought	as	such	takes	you	away	from	your	settled	peace	with	the	universe.
IF	YOU	GIVE	RISE	TO	A	THOUGHT	OF	JOY,	YOU	WILL	BE	WHIRLED
AWAY	BY
WIND.
IF	 YOU	CAN	DISCERN	ALL	 THIS	YOU	WILL	NOT	BE	AFFECTED	BY
OBJECTIVE
THINGS	WHICH	YOU	CAN	TURN	TO	YOUR	OWN	ADVANTAGE.	THEN
YOU	CAN
WALK	 ON	 WATER	 AS	 IF	 ON	 THE	 GROUND,	 AND	 WALK	 ON	 THE
GROUND	AS	IF
ON	WATER.
Don't	 take	 this	statement	 in	a	factual	way,	as	Christians	have	done.	What	he	 is
saying	is	simply	that	to	the	innermost	being	the	outer	world	is	just	a	dream.	In
the	dream	you	have	walked	on	water,	in	the	dream	you	have	flown	in	the	sky,	in
the	dream	everything	is	possible.
But	when	you	wake	up	you	find	the	dream	water,	the	dream	fire,	the	dream	sky
were	all	imagination	and	nothing	else.
But	these	statements,	made	with	absolutely	good	intentions,	create	trouble	later
on,	because	people	start	thinking	that	unless	you	can	walk	on	water	you	are	not	a
self-realized	one.
The	miracles	of	Jesus	walking	on	water	or	raising	dead	Lazarus	back	to	life	...	A
great	 search	by	Christian	 experts	 shows	 that	 these	 things	never	happened,	 that
they	were	added	 later	on,	almost	 three	hundred	years	 later,	 to	make	Jesus	 look
special	 --	 not	 an	 ordinary	 human	 being,	 but	 really	 a	 son	 of	 God.	 For	 two
thousand	years	Christians	 have	been	 insisting	 that	 these	 are	 facts.	Now,	 in	 the
light	 of	 science	 and	more	 intelligence,	 even	Christian	 scholars	 are	 saying	 that
these	 are	 only	 metaphors,	 added	 by	 the	 disciples	 to	 raise	 their	 master	 to	 a
superior	and	higher	position	in	such	a	way	that	nobody	can	compete	with	him.
I	 have	 heard	 that	 two	 Christian	 bishops,	 visiting	 Jerusalem,	 had	 a	 very	 great
friend,	a	rabbi.
They	asked	him	to	show	them	all	the	holy	places.	The	rabbi	took	them	to	many
places	which	were	concerned	with	 Jesus	 --	where	he	 raised	Lazarus,	where	he
made	water	turn	into	wine.
And	then	at	the	Sea	of	Galilee	he	took	them	to	the	place	where	it	is	thought	he
walked	on	water.
The	rabbi	said,	"Would	you	like	to	have	a	demonstration?"
The	bishops	could	not	believe.	They	said,	"Can	you	do	it?"
He	said,	"If	Jesus	can	do	it,	an	old	Jew,	why	can't	every	rabbi	do	it?"
They	said,	"My	God,	we	used	to	think	that	it	is	something	special."
They	said,	"It	is	very	ordinary	as	far	as	Judaism	is	concerned."
So	the	rabbi	got	out	from	the	boat,	walked	a	few	feet	away,	and	came	back.	The
bishops	could	not	believe	their	eyes,	they	were	stunned.	One	bishop	said,	"If	you
can	do	it	...	I	am	a	believer	in	Jesus,	can	I	also	try?"
The	rabbi	said,	"It	is	perfectly	good,	you	can	try.	If	your	faith	is	right	you	will	be
able	to	walk	on	water."
Osho	-	The	Miracle
94
Chapter	7	-	The	mysterious	one
But	he	got	out	of	the	boat	from	the	other	side	and	immediately	started	drowning
and	shouting,	"Help!	Help!"
So	the	rabbi	asked	the	other	bishop,	"Should	we	tell	the	old	boy	the	right	way	to
walk	on	water?	It	has	to	be	on	this	side	of	the	boat.	There	are	stones	...	you	have
to	know	exactly	where	the	stones	are.	Then	anybody	can	do	it."
Poor	fellow	...	stepped	out	on	the	wrong	side.	Neither	faith	nor	no-faith	is	going
to	help.
But	people	go	on	insisting,	particularly	the	priesthood	of	the	all	the	religions.
Nikos	Kazantzakis	was	expelled	from	the	Orthodox	Church	of	Greece,	because
he	wrote	 a	 book	on	 Jesus	 as	 if	 he	were	 a	 human	being,	 not	 a	 son	of	God.	Of
course	human	beings	cannot	walk	on	water.	They	go	on	water	in	the	proper	way
--	 in	 a	 small	 boat	 or	 a	 big	 boat.	 But	 the	 Orthodox	 Church	 expelled	 him	 for
making	Jesus	Christ	a	human	being.	 In	his	book	Jesus	 falls	 in	 love	with	Mary
Magdalen.	Now	that	is	absolutely	insulting	to	the	orthodox	mind.
Just	 yesterday	 Anando	 brought	 me	 the	 news	 that	 in	 America	 they	 have	 been
trying	to	make	a	film	based	on	that	book.	But	continually	the	government	comes
in,	 the	church	comes	 in,	and	 there	are	huge	demonstrations	 that	 the	making	of
the	film	should	be	stopped.	And	the	only	point	in	the	film	they	insist	is	wrong	...
It's	 very	 human,	 Jesus	 hanging	 on	 the	 cross	 falls	 asleep,	 nothing	 to	 do	 ...	 and
thinks	 of	 Mary	 Magdalen.	 That	 is	 the	 problem,	 he	 simply	 dreams	 of	 his
girlfriend.
Now	another	producer	has	 taken	courage,	knowing	perfectly	well	 that	 the	 film
will	 be	 banned,	will	 have	 to	 go	 underground.	But	 it	 is	worth	making	 to	 bring
Jesus	down	to	the	earth,	to	make	him	a	son	of	the	earth.	What	is	wrong	in	it?	The
poor	fellow	is	hanging	on	the	cross,	isn't	that	enough?	You	cannot	give	him	even
the	small	solace	of	dreaming	about	his	girlfriend?	I	don't	think	there	is	anything
wrong	about	it.
In	 fact	 if	 Jesus	 was	 ever	 crucified	 he	 must	 have	 thought	 of	Mary	Magdalen.
What	else	was	 there	 to	 think	of?	He	was	finished	with	God,	he	had	shouted	at
God,	 "Father,	 have	 you	 forsaken	me?	 --	 because	 six	 hours	 have	 passed,	 I	 am
hanging	here	and	no	miracle	 is	happening.	 I	was	hoping	 that	you	would	come
sitting	on	a	white	cloud,	playing	 'Alleluia!'	on	 the	harp.	 I	can	see	all	around	--
there	is	no	white	cloud,	no	song	on	the	harp,	no	sign	that	you	are	even	aware	that
your	only	begotten	son	is	being	hanged."
In	 such	 a	 situation	 it	 is	 absolutely	 natural	 that	 he	must	 have	 said	 in	 his	mind,
"Fuck	it!"
What	 else	 to	 do?	 And	 he	 must	 have	 realized	 that	 he	 had	 been	 unnecessarily
stupid,	 otherwise	 a	 beautiful	 woman	 ...	 and	 he	 could	 have	 lived	 silently,
peacefully.	But	he	unnecessarily	got	into	this	trip	...
All	 these	people	have	been	made	ninety	percent	fictitious	simply	 to	raise	 them
above	the	rest	of	humanity.
THEREFORE,	 FOLLOWERS	 OF	 THE	 WAY,	 THE	 ONE	 WHO	 IS	 NOW
LISTENING
TO	 MY	 EXPOUNDING	 OF	 THE	 DHARMA	 IS	 CERTAINLY	 NOT	 YOUR
FOUR
ELEMENTS,	 BUT	 ONE	 WHO	 CAN	 MAKE	 use	 OF	 YOUR	 FOUR
ELEMENTS.
Buddhists	believe	that	the	body	is	made	of	four	elements.	And	the	fifth	is	your
consciousness,	which	is	not	part	of	the	body	but	lives	in	the	body;	which	can	go
out,	can	enter	into	another	womb.	This	fifth	is	your	reality.	In	your	deep	silence
you	start	disentangling	yourself	 from	 the	body,	 from	 the	mind,	 from	 the	heart.
And	what	remains	is	just	a	pure	space.
Osho	-	The	Miracle
95
Chapter	7	-	The	mysterious	one
This	 pure	 space	 is	 the	 origin	 of	 you	 and	 of	 all.	 This	 pure	 space	 has	 never
changed,	it	is	always	here	and	now.	It	knows	no	time,	no	space.	It	fills	the	whole
universe,	which	is	infinite.
Once	you	have	known	it,	your	life	changes.
IF	YOU	HOLD	SUCH	A	VIEW	...
Remember,	it	should	not	only	be	a	view.	If	you	experience	such	a	space,	YOU
WILL
THEN	BE	FREE	TO	GO	OR	STAY.	Once	you	have	known	this	space	you	have
known	freedom.	And	then	it	is	up	to	you	to	remain	in	your	form,	to	change	the
form,	or	simply	to	disappear	into	the	infinity	of	existence.
As	 far	 as	 I	 know,	 nobody	 who	 has	 known	 this	 space	 has	 ever	 entered	 into
another	form.
The	 enlightened	 man's	 life	 is	 his	 last	 life.	 Why	 should	 he	 bother	 to	 get	 into
another	headache?
Why	 should	 he	 get	 into	 another	 imprisonment,	 which	 has	 illness,	 sickness,
oldness,	death	and	thousands	of	miseries?
It	 is	 only	 the	 unconscious	 human	 being	 who	 goes	 on	 groping	 from	womb	 to
womb.	The	conscious	one	simply	leaves	this	body	and	becomes	part	of	the	sky.
There	is	no	need	to	be	confined	unless	you	love	to	torture	yourself.	Nobody	has
done	that	up	to	now.	Perhaps	nobody	can	do	it.	Seeing	the	freedom	of	infinity,
who	is	going	to	look	back	towards	a	form,	a	body,	with	all	its	suffering,	misery,
troubles?	It	is	just	against	nature.

compose.	 On	 the	 contrary,	 it	 composes	 you.	 Once	 a	 man	 has	 tasted	 the
meditative	 space	 within	 him,	 everything	 that	 he	 touches	 becomes	 gold;

a	majesty.	It	is	a	miracle.

Just	remember	the	buddha	in	your	flesh	and	the	world	is	yours.	You	don't	have	to

This	remaining	apart	brings	two	things.	One,	a	buddha	inside	awakens;	and	the
other,	a	new	mastery	over	the	whole	existence.	It	is	not	political,	it	is	existential.
It	does	not	need	to	have	any	map,	it	has	no	boundaries.
Finding	the	buddha	in	you,	you	have	found	the	emperor.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
I	HAVE	UNDERSTOOD	YOU	TO	SAY	LATELY	THAT	THE	BUDDHA,	THE
"MYSTERIOUS	 ONE"	 WITHIN	 US,	 IS	 ALWAYS	 THERE,	 CONSTANT,
UNAFFECTED
BY	WHATEVER	WE	DO.
I	 ALWAYS	 HAD	 THE	 FEELING	 THAT	 THE	 MORE	 OFTEN	 WE	 ARE
CONSCIOUS,	THE	MORE	WE	NOURISH	THE	 INNER	BUDDHA;	BUT	 IF
NOTHING	WE	CAN	DO
NEGATIVELY	CAN	DIMINISH	HIM,	THEN	MY	FEELING	MUST	BE	JUST
IMAGINATION.	IS	IT?
Maneesha,	neither	can	you	do	anything	negative	to	harm	the	buddha	inside	you,
nor	can	you	do	anything	positive	to	nourish	the	buddha	inside	you.	It	is	complete
and	perfect	in	itself.
All	that	you	can	do	is:	by	being	conscious	in	your	actions	you	can	recognize	it;
by	unconscious	actions	you	can	forget	it.	But	you	cannot	do	anything	to	it.	Either
you	can	 remember	and	 recognize	and	be	 transformed,	or	you	can	go	on	doing
things	which	 take	 you	 away	 from	 it	 and	 completely	 forget	 the	way	 back.	But
whether	you	are	positive	or	negative,	your	innermost	buddha	remains	the	same.
You	cannot	do	anything	favorable	or	unfavorable	to	it.	It	is	your	transcendence.
Before	we	enter	into	the	temple	to	have	a	look	whether	the	buddha	is	there	or	not
...	a	few	little	 laughs,	 just	 to	prepare	the	ground.	Laughter	 takes	away	much	of
your	 seriousness,	 which	 is	 a	 hindrance.	 It	 takes	 away	 your	 burden.	 In	 a	 deep
laughter	you	become	 total.	 It	 is	not	 that	you	 laugh	 fifty	percent,	 that	 this	 time
you	laughed	thirty	percent.	When	you	really	laugh,	remember	Sardar	Gurudayal
Singh:	he	laughs	a	hundred	percent.	And	it	does	not	matter	whether	it	is	time	to
laugh	 or	 not.	 Laughter	 in	 itself	 is	 such	 a	 healthy,	 enjoyable	 phenomenon,	 that
you	don't	have	to	have	some	reason	for	it.
Osho	-	The	Miracle
97
Chapter	7	-	The	mysterious	one
I	 have	 to	 tell	 you	 the	 jokes	 just	 because	 you	will	 not	 laugh	without	 a	 reason.
They	are	unnecessary;	if	you	start	laughing	without	a	reason,	that	will	be	more
spontaneous	and	fresh.
Soon	 there	 will	 come	 a	 time	 that	 just	 a	 drumbeat,	 and	 everybody	 goes	 one
hundred	percent.
These	jokes	are	only	for	beginners.	The	old	sinners	don't	need	them.
It	is	the	weekend	in	Harlem,	and	we	find	Zabriski	in	an	all-black	disco	called	the
Horny	Honky,	having	a	high	time	and	partying	like	crazy.
A	beautiful	woman	named	Kootchee	slithers	up	beside	Zabriski	and	asks,	"Hey,
baby!	Buy	a	lonely	girl	a	drink?"
Zabriski	 smiles	at	 this	unbelievable	 luck	and	says,	 "Okay,	 sure,	but	 to	 tell	you
the	truth,	I	would	really	like	to	get	screwed."
Kootchee	 is	 cool	 and	 she	 can	dig	 it,	 so	 she	 takes	 our	Polack	by	 the	 hand	 and
leads	him	across	the	smoke-filled,	music-thumping	dance	floor	to	a	door	with	a
small	slit	in	it	marked,
"Private."
"Just	wait	here,	white	boy,"	says	Kootchee,	and	she	disappears	behind	the	door.
Suddenly	 the	 slit	 opens	 and	 a	 woman's	 voice	 asks,	 "What	 would	 you	 like,
Sugarpie?"
"Like?"	repeats	Zabriski.	"Like	I	said,	I	wanna	get	screwed."
"Sho-thing,	darling,"	replies	the	voice.	"But	as	you	can	see,	this	is	a	private	club.
You	have	to	slip	one	hundred	bucks	into	this	slot	for	a	membership	fee."
At	this,	the	partying	Polack	shouts,	"Right	on!	Get	down!	And	get	funky!"	as	he
puts	a	hundred	dollar	bill	in	the	slot.
Five	minutes	go	by	 and	nothing	happens,	 so	Zabriski	 knocks	 again.	When	 the
little	slot	opens,	Zabriski	shouts,	"Hey!	I	wanna	get	screwed!"
"What?"	comes	the	reply.	"Again?"
Devageet	and	two	friends	are	hailing	a	rickshaw	when	they	see	pretty	young	Ma
Yoga	Butter	also	trying	to	hail	the	same	rickshaw.
Devageet,	 seeing	 the	 situation	 and	 being	 such	 a	 gentleman,	 offers,	 "Come	 on,
Butter,	 you	might	 as	well	 sit	 on	my	 lap.	 I'm	 too	old	 to	give	you	my	 seat,	 and
don't	worry,	I'm	too	old	for	it	to	be	dangerous	for	you	to	sit	on	my	lap."
Yoga	 Butter	 smiles	 and	 accepts	 the	 invitation.	 But	 after	 jolting	 around	 Bund
Garden	Road	in	the	rickshaw	for	a	while	with	Butter	bouncing	all	over	his	lap,
Devageet	smiles	and	says,
"I'm	 afraid	 I	was	wrong,	 Butter.	You	will	 have	 to	 get	 off.	 I'm	 not	 as	 old	 as	 I
thought	I	was!"
A	potato	and	a	carrot	are	hitchhiking	at	the	side	of	the	road	when	a	cyclist	comes
around	the	corner	and	runs	down	the	potato.
The	next	day,	the	carrot	goes	to	visit	his	friend	in	the	hospital.	The	potato	does
not	look	too	good.
"Tell	 me,	 doc,"	 says	 the	 carrot,	 anxiously,	 "do	 you	 think	 my	 friend	 will	 be
okay?"

the	question	is	--	What	did	Eve	say	to	Adam	that	fateful	night	in	the	garden	of

Olga	gets	worried	and	 thinks	 and	 thinks,	but	 after	 a	 few	minutes	 she	gives	up
completely	and	says,	"Oh,	my	god!	That	is	a	hard	one."

DECORATION	ON	THE
DOOR	 OF	 OUR	 HOUSE.	 THE	 IMPORTANT	 THING	 IS	 YOUR
EXPERIENTIAL
REALIZATION	OF	THIS	STATE.
Maneesha,	before	I	discuss	the	great	matter	of	Zen,	Avirbhava	has	brought	a	few
ancient	gods	to	be	inaugurated	into	her	Museum	of	Gods.	Her	assistant,	Anando,
has	 also	 brought	 a	 few	 small	 gods.	Before	 I	 tell	 them	 to	 show	you	what	 they
have	brought	...
The	research	on	the	subject	of	the	rat	as	an	object	of	worship	...	The	rat	is	a	very
ancient	 god,	 but	 still	 prevalent,	 not	 dead.	 The	 research	 was	 done	 by	 the
appropriate	person,	Sardar	Gurudayal	Singh.
"The	rat	 is	 the	charioteer	of	 the	elephant	god,	Ganesh.	According	 to	myth	 it	 is
worshipped	all	over	India,	and	especially	in	Maharashtra.
Rats	are	said	to	consume	more	grain	than	all	the	people	of	India.	They	are	one	of
the	causes	of	India's	poverty,	and	their	growth	rate	is	far	greater	than	that	of	the
Indian	people.
During	Indira	Gandhi's	rule	there	were	suggestions	brought	to	parliament	about
how	 to	 tackle	 this	 problem.	 Immediately,	 opposition	 leaders	 from	 Morarji
Desai's	party	argued	that	a	poisoning	of	rats	was	out	of	the	question	because	that
would	hurt	the	religious	feelings	of	Osho	-	The	Miracle
102
Chapter	8	-	Joy	in	the	morning
Maharashtran	 people.	 The	 only	 solution	 to	 this	menace	 of	 rats	 destroying	 the
grainstocks	that	was	considered	was	to	make	the	rats	aware	of	birth	control.	But
how	to	get	this	message	to	the	rats?	The	opposition	claimed	that	they	had	done
their	 duty	 by	 suggesting	 this	 great	 solution;	 the	 implementing	 of	 birth	 control
upon	the	rats	would	be	the	ruling	party's	affair.	That	was	the	end	of	the	debate."
Since	 that	 time	Morarji	Desai	himself	has	been	a	prime	minister	and	again	 the
question	was	brought	up.	Now	he	was	in	a	difficult	situation.	As	a	Gandhian	he
is	against	birth	control.
Instead	of	birth	control,	celibacy	is	the	solution.	In	the	first	place	he	should	have
considered	that	teaching	rats	birth	control	is	going	against	Gandhian	philosophy.
They	should	be	taught	how	to	be	celibate.
Secondly,	when	he	was	in	opposition	he	had	himself	proposed	that	birth	control
was	the	only	solution.	They	cannot	be	killed,	even	though	because	of	them	the
whole	of	India	is	suffering	from	poverty.	Now	that	he	was	in	the	ruling	party,	the
prime	minister,	he	could	not	go	against	his	word.	He	was	in	a	difficult	situation.
And	by	this	time	the	rats	had	grown	far	bigger	and	far	more	numerous	than	at	the
time	of	Indira.
Right	 now	 they	 are	 eating	 three	 times	more	 than	 the	 Indian	 population.	 Soon
they	will	 starve	 the	whole	population,	 but	 the	politician	 cowards	will	 not	 take
any	step.	Morarji	put	it	aside	into	the	file,	saying	that	an	investigation	should	be
made	of	how	to	introduce	birth	control	to	the	rats.	This	is	the	way	of	the	cunning
politicians	--	always	create	an	investigation	committee	which	does	great	work	in
two,	three	years;	then	take	their	report	and	file	it	away.
By	 that	 time	 most	 probably	 the	 prime	 minister	 is	 gone,	 and	 the	 new	 prime
minister	has	no	obligation	to	be	bothered	with	any	report	that	had	been	asked	for
by	the	previous	one.
It	is	strange	that	people	can	see	human	beings	dying,	but	they	cannot	hurt	their
stupid	feelings,	which	they	call	religious	feelings.	The	whole	idea	is	so	stupid!
The	elephant	god	Ganesh	is	a	myth.	The	story	is	that	Shiva's	wife	was	taking	a
bath.	 It	 seems	 she	must	 have	 been	 taking	 a	 bath	 for	 the	 first	 time	 in	 her	 life,
because	so	much	dust	and	rust	came	off	her	body.	In	the	bathroom	she	became
playful,	and	made	a	statue	from	that	rust	and	dust.	And	because	she	is	a	goddess,
she	was	able	to	breathe	life	into	the	statue.	That	is	how	Ganesh	was	born.
And	she	told	Ganesh,	"I	am	taking	a	bath,	so	you	sit	down	outside	on	the	steps.
Your	father	is	out,	don't	allow	anybody	in."	But	he	had	no	idea	of	the	father	...
Who	is	the	father?	In	fact	nobody	has	any	idea	who	the	father	is.	It	is	not	only
Ganesh;	everybody	simply	believes,	and	often	their	belief	is	not	the	case.
Shiva	came,	and	Shiva	is	a	very	angry	god	...	Ganesh	stopped	him,	saying,	"My
mother	is	taking	a	bath."
Shiva	 said,	 "Your	mother?	 I	 have	been	gone.	How	have	you	been	born?"	 In	 a
rage	he	cut	off	 the	head	of	Ganesh,	 and	 threw	 the	head	 into	 the	valley	 --	 they
lived	 in	 the	Himalayas.	He	entered	 the	house	and	asked	his	wife,	"What	 is	 the
matter?	Who	was	this	fellow	sitting	outside.	I	cut	off	his	head	and	threw	the	head
into	the	valley."
His	wife	was	very	angry.	She	told	the	whole	story	of	how	she	had	made	him.	He
said,	"My	God,	I	have	killed	my	own	son!"
He	went	in	search,	but	how	to	find	where	that	head	had	gone?	He	just	found	a
small	 elephant,	 so	he	 cut	off	 the	head	of	 the	 elephant	 and	put	 it	 on	 top	of	 the
child's	body.	Being	a	supreme	God,	he	managed	to	glue	them	together	perfectly.
But	because	the	child	was	small	Osho	-	The	Miracle
103
Chapter	8	-	Joy	in	the	morning
and	the	head	was	too	heavy,	 the	child	needed	some	kind	of	horse	or	vehicle	to
carry	him,	he	could	not	walk	with	all	 that	weight.	And	these	stupid	 ideas	have
prevailed	with	millions	of	people.
So	Shiva	 looked	 around	 and	 found	 a	 rat,	 and	Ganesh	 rides	 on	 the	 rat.	 Such	 a
poor	fellow,	the	rat	is	carrying	such	a	load	...	And	he	is	loved	and	worshipped	all
over	India,	most	particularly	in	Maharashtra.	Morarji	Desai	should	consult	Shiva
about	how	he	managed	to	teach	the	rat	to	carry	Ganesh.
So	nobody	can	say	that	it	is	a	simple	matter,	"just	kill	those	rats."	Anybody	who
says	that	most	probably	will	be	killed.	Particularly	no	politician	is	going	to	take
the	 risk,	 because	 then	who	 is	going	 to	vote	 for	him?	Being	against	 the	 rat,	 no
politician	can	win.	And	the	rat	has	been	doing	so	much	harm	that	just	ten	years
more	and	he	will	finish	everything	and	leave	this	country	a	graveyard.	But	still
the	politicians	will	not	take	any	step.
More	about	rats:	"The	rat	has	been	used	as	a	symbol	of	 the	cosmos.	The	head,
neck,	 and	 body	 signify	 the	 upper	 planes	 of	 atma,	 which	 means	 self;	 buddhi,
which	means	intelligence;	and	higher	manas,	the	awareness,	consciousness.	Each
leg	of	the	rat	represents	a	different	plane:	the	lower	manas,	the	lower	mind,	the
astral	mind,	the	ethereal	mind,	and	other	physical	aspects."
These	 idiots	 who	 go	 on	 making	 such	 metaphors	 and	 symbols	 should	 be
imprisoned	 and	 punished,	 but	 they	 are	 worshipped	 and	 respected	 as	 great
scholars.
"The	 Dakotan	 explanation	 for	 why	 the	 moon	 wanes	 is	 that	 it	 is	 eaten	 by	 a
multitude	of	rats.
In	Germanic	belief,	the	soul	assumes	the	form	of	a	rat	or	mouse,	and	in	this	form
may	come	forth	from	a	sleeper's	mouth."
So	beware!	Never	allow	your	mouth	to	open	in	your	sleep.	The	rat	may	escape.
I	have	heard	a	story	that	Nancy	Reagan	phoned	her	doctor,	"Come	quickly!	A	rat
has	entered	into	snoring	Ronald's	mouth!"
The	doctor	said,	"I	am	coming,	but	it	will	take	a	few	minutes.	Meanwhile	you	do
one	 thing,	 hold	 a	 small	 piece	 of	 cheese	 over	 his	 mouth.	 Perhaps	 the	 rat	 may
come	back	out."
When	the	doctor	arrived	after	ten	minutes,	he	could	not	believe	his	eyes.	Nancy
was	waving	a	cat	over	Ronald's	face.	He	said,	"My	God,	this	way	the	rat	will	go
even	deeper!	I	told	you	to	hold	a	piece	of	cheese!"
She	said,	"I	did,	but	the	rat	pulled	the	cheese	in!	Now	I	am	holding	the	cat	to	pull
the	rat	and	the	cheese	both	out.	Now	that	you	have	come,	I	can	relax,	you	do	the
work!"
But	this	really	was	a	religious	belief	in	Germany.
Obviously	 the	 soul	 must	 enter	 from	 somewhere	 and	 must	 get	 out	 from
somewhere;	some	door	is	needed,	and	the	mouth	seems	to	be	the	right	place	for
it.	 If	 you	 are	 sleeping	with	 somebody	 else,	 then	 it	 is	 even	more	 dangerous	 --
somebody	else's	rat	may	enter	your	mouth.
Always	keep	your	mouth	 shut,	 for	 safety	and	 security.	Neither	 allow	 the	 inner
one	to	go	out,	nor	allow	an	outside	one	to	come	in!
"The	 name	 of	 the	 rat	 is	 taboo	 in	 some	 parts	 of	 Europe.	 In	 Bohemia	 a	 white
mouse	should	not	be	killed,	it	should	be	taken	out	of	the	trap	and	fed.	Otherwise
luck	will	desert	the	house	Osho	-	The	Miracle
104
Chapter	8	-	Joy	in	the	morning
and	other	rats	will	increase	in	number.	Sometimes	spells	are	used	to	keep	down
the	number	of	rats.
Elsewhere	four	pairs	of	rats	are	married	and	set	adrift	--	with	the	idea	that	 this
will	cause	the	other	rats	to	go	away."
When	they	see	that	the	others	are	going	on	their	honeymoon	...	just	get	your	own
boat	and	go	on	a	honeymoon	too.	Why	are	you	wasting	your	life	unnecessarily
in	those	dark	holes,	when	others	are	enjoying	the	fresh	air	on	the	river?	The	idea
seems	to	be	good.
"Rats	are	an	omen	of	death	in	Austria.	In	other	places	they	are	a	good	omen.
In	Zoroastrianism	the	 rat	 is	an	evil	animal,	and	 the	killing	of	one	 rat	equals	 in
merit	the	slaying	of	four	lions."
So	don't	be	worried	--	if	you	are	a	rat,	you	are	equal	to	four	lions.	If	your	wife
calls	you	a	rat,	she	is	saying,	"You	are	equal	to	four	lions."
"In	 Jewish	 folklore,	 eating	 anything	 gnawed	 by	 a	 rat	 causes	 loss	 of	 memory.
Thus	cats,	which	eat	rats,	don't	remember	their	masters."
Rats	destroy	 the	memory	system;	 that's	why	cats	go	on	 forgetting	who	 is	 their
master.
Dogs	never	eat	rats	so	they	always	remember	their	master.
And	 simultaneously	 Anando	 is	 also	 contributing	 something	 to	 Avirbhava's
Museum	of	Gods,	the	monkey.
The	monkey	has	also	been	a	problem	in	India.	You	cannot	shoot	a	monkey	--	a
monkey	can	shoot	you,	there	is	no	constitutional	law	against	that.
In	 the	capital	of	North	 India,	Lucknow,	 there	 is	 a	very	beautiful	 temple	of	 the
monkey-god	Hanuman.	 Surrounded	 by	 great	 trees,	 it	 is	 a	 very	 ancient	 temple,
and	 hundreds	 of	 monkeys	 live	 on	 those	 trees.	 People	 go	 with	 food,	 flowers,
sweets,	and	those	monkeys	...	of	course	Hanuman	is	just	a	stone	monkey,	but	the
real	monkeys	are	all	around	and	they	are	flourishing,	becoming	stronger.
Something	happened	suddenly	in	1955.	Nobody	knows	the	actual	cause,	but	the
monkeys	became	violent	at	the	sight	of	any	kind	of	uniform.	So	the	policeman,
the	postman,	the	military	man,	 the	sannyasin	 ...	none	of	them	could	pass	down
that	 street.	Those	monkeys	would	 jump	on	 them	and	hit	 them	hard,	 tear	 away
their	 clothes	 and	 they	 would	 have	 to	 run	 naked,	 oozing	 blood,	 down	 a	 main
street	in	Lucknow.	And	the	assembly	of	Lucknow	could	not	decide	what	to	do.
It	is	something	strange	that	both	monkeys	and	dogs	are	against	uniforms	--	both
seem	 to	 be	 very	 revolutionary.	 Uniformed	 people	 are	 very	 orthodox,	 all	 just
imitating	each	other.	Dogs	immediately	start	barking	when	they	see	the	postman
or	the	policeman	or	the	sannyasin;	anybody	who	wears	a	uniform	provokes	dogs
and	monkeys	to	fight	against	this	traditionalism.
It	used	to	be	that	monkeys	only	made	faces	and	threatened	from	the	trees.	But	in
Lucknow
--	perhaps	somebody	had	hurt	them,	nobody	knows	the	cause	--	for	fifteen	days
they	 made	 such	 a	 chaos	 that	 the	 whole	 market	 had	 to	 be	 closed.	 And	 the
government	could	not	decide	to	shoot	those	monkeys,	because	if	they	were	shot
the	whole	Hindu	population's	 religious	 heart	would	 be	 hurt.	But	 since	 nobody
came	on	that	road	anymore,	those	monkeys	came	to	their	senses	--	because	now
no	more	food	was	available.	So	finally	they	decided	not	to	harm	people	Osho	-
The	Miracle
105
Chapter	8	-	Joy	in	the	morning
any	 longer.	 They	 could	 see	 the	 point	 --	 if	 nobody	 passes	 on	 the	 road,	 nobody
comes	to	the	temple,	they	don't	get	any	food	or	flowers.	Otherwise	they	were	the
blessed	monkeys,	very	rich.
Seeing	 the	 situation,	 after	 fifteen	 days	 they	 had	 to	 surrender.	 Slowly,	 slowly
people	started	opening	their	shops	again,	moving	on	the	street,	cautiously	at	first.
And	the	government	had	alerted	the	people	that	nobody	should	shoot	a	monkey.
Rather	than	calling	the	army	to	shoot	the	monkeys,	they	ordered	people,	"If	you
shoot	a	monkey	you	will	be	thought	a	criminal,	and	you	will	be	treated	just	as	if
you	have	shot	a	man.	No	distinction	will	be	made!"
These	 poor	 politicians	 are	 ruling	 all	 over	 the	world,	 and	 they	 are	 ruled	 by	 all
kinds	of	superstitions	and	stupidities.
"Zoolatry,	or	the	worship	of	animals,	is	not	uncommon	in	the	East.	The	monkey
is	among	those	animals	worshipped,	like	the	tiger	and	the	snake,	out	of	fear.
It	 is	 said	 that	 the	 monkey	 is	 a	 symbol	 of	 the	 lower	 mind	 which	 imitates	 or
reflects	 the	 higher,	 or	 represents	 the	 automatic	 mind.	 The	 monkey	 god,
Hanuman,	son	of	Vayu,	the	god	of	winds,	is	worshipped	today	in	India.	He	is	a
symbol	of	the	intellect	which	comes	from	the	higher	mind,	Vayu.
And	in	the	orthodox	villages	in	India	the	monkey	is	always	free	from	harm	and
is	magic.
Its	magic	influence	is	implored	against	the	whirlwind,	and	it	 is	also	invoked	to
avert	sterility.
The	 bones	 of	 monkeys	 are	 said	 to	 pollute	 the	 ground.	Mentioning	 a	 monkey
brings	starvation	for	the	rest	of	the	day,	but	it	is	regarded	as	lucky	to	keep	one	in
the	stable.
It	is	seriously	believed	in	Africa	and	South	America	that	monkeys	can	talk,	but
do	not	for	fear	of	being	made	to	work."
That	is	really	good	...	 if	 they	talk	there	is	every	danger	man	will	force	them	to
work.	It	is	better	to	keep	quiet.
I	 have	 heard	 about	 a	 small	 child	 who	 would	 not	 talk.	 He	 was	 taken	 to	 this
psychologist,	to	that	psychiatrist,	to	a	psychoanalyst	...	nobody	could	get	him	to
utter	a	single	word.	He	could	hear	perfectly	well;	he	was	checked,	his	ears	were
perfect.	But	he	would	not	 show	even	a	 sign	 from	his	 eyes	or	 face	 that	he	had
heard	anything.
But	one	day	at	the	dining	table	he	said	to	his	mother,	"Where's	the	salt?"
The	mother	said,	"My	God,	you	have	never	spoken	before."
He	said,	"Nothing	was	ever	missing	before,	why	should	I	have	spoken?	I	heard
all	those	psychoanalysts	and	psychiatrists	and	all	the	nonsense	they	were	talking.
But	to	speak	means	going	to	school,	and	I	hate	school.	It's	just	because	of	the	salt
that	I	had	to	speak	now,	in	spite	of	myself.	But	this	is	just	between	me	and	you,
don't	 tell	 anybody.	 I	 am	never	going	 to	 speak	again,	 so	nobody	would	believe
you	anyway."
There	was	not	a	witness,	either.	The	mother	was	at	a	loss.	She	told	her	husband,
but	 the	husband	said,	"It	 is	not	possible,	six	years	silence	and	suddenly	 ...	You
will	have	to	give	me	proof.	Make	him	speak	again."
But	he	would	not	speak,	he	had	made	the	point	clear	that	speaking	meant	going
to	school.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	8	-	Joy	in	the	morning
This	 idea	 in	South	America	 and	South	Africa	 --	both	 faraway	places	 --	 is	 that
monkeys	understand	your	language,	but	they	will	not	speak	just	out	of	fear	that
they	would	be	forced	to	work.
"Another	story	suggests	that	apes	carry	off	women	to	the	woods.	In	many	places
respect	for	 the	monkey	is	based	on	the	belief	 that	 it	 is	 the	abode	of	 the	human
spirit.
Among	the	Hottentots,	the	killer	of	a	baboon	has	to	sacrifice	a	sheep	or	goat	and
hang	 the	 lowest	vertebrae	around	his	neck,	or	he	will	 suffer	 from	 lumbago.	 In
China	the	monkey	is	regarded	as	lucky	in	that	it	keeps	sickness	away,	while	in
Java	an	offering	made	to	the	king	of	the	monkeys	is	believed	to	cure	sterility."
Now,	Avirbhava,	bring	your	rat,	and	Anando,	your	monkeys.
(AVIRBHAVA	PUTS	A	BIG,	BLACK	TOY	RAT	AT	THE	MASTER'S	FEET.	IT
STARTS	DANCING	AND	MAKING	COMICAL	SOUNDS.	SHE	ALSO	PUTS
A	 CLOCKWORK	 MONKEY	 ON	 THE	 PODIUM	 WHICH	 WANDERS
AROUND	THE
MASTER'S	FEET.	ANANDO	SITS	A	SMALL	RUBBER	MONKEY	ON	THE
PODIUM.)	Very	meditative	monkey!
Well,	where	are	your	small	monkeys?
(MANY	LITTLE	MONKEYS	ARE	PUT	ON	THE	PODIUM.	MEANWHILE
AVIRBHAVA'S	MONKEY	IS	RUNNING	AWAY	AND	AVIRBHAVA	HAS	TO
JUMP	TO
CATCH	IT.	EVERYBODY	IS	LAUGHING.)
Just	give	a	good	clap,	too.
Now,	remove	your	gods.	Just	ask	all	the	sannyasins	around	the	world	to	find	out
about	all	the	animals	that	have	been	worshipped	by	human	beings	--	to	show	to
everyone	 what	 kind	 of	 past	 we	 have	 had.	 And	 there	 are	 still	 people	 who	 are
worshipping	animals.
Religion	 has	 been	 reduced	 to	 such	 nonsense.	 And	 the	 harm	 is	 that	 people
become	 involved	 in	 these	 absolutely	 absurd	 ideas	 and	 forget	 completely	 about
themselves.	 The	 only	 religion	 is	 the	 religion	 of	 being	 conscious.	 All	 other
religions	are	simply	toys	for	children.
But	we	go	on	living	unconsciously,	without	seeing	what	people	are	doing.	They
celebrate	 monkeys,	 elephants,	 they	 worship	 even	 rats.	 This	 is	 such	 an
undignified	state	of	affairs	that	it	has	to	be	changed	completely.
So	Avirbhava's	Museum	of	Gods	will	be	immensely	significant	for	visitors	--	to
show	them,	"This	is	your	past,	this	is	your	religion,	and	this	is	still	your	present.
You	 cannot	 simply	 say	 that	 it	 is	 past.	 And	 do	 you	 want	 to	 realize	 yourself
through	rats?"
This	museum	will	provide	a	great	 insight	 to	anybody	who	comes	here	without
any	prejudice.	But	it	will	bring	many	law	cases	against	me,	although	we	are	not
harming	their	gods	--	they	will	be	taken	care	of	--	we	are	just	putting	them	in	a
museum,	where	all	your	scriptures	and	all	your	ideologies	also	belong.
We	want	a	complete	break	from	the	past	so	that	man	can	have	his	wings	to	fly
into	the	sky	of	consciousness,	absolutely	free.	That	is	the	revolution	of	Zen.

He	 is	 saying	 that	 in	 your	 innermost	 being	 the	 unknown,	 the	 miraculous,	 the
buddha,	lives.
It	cannot	be	burned.	Your	consciousness	cannot	be	burned	or	destroyed	by	any
other	means.	It	is	indestructible.	He	is	not	referring	to	your	body.	Your	body	may
be	burned,	you	cannot	pass	 through	 fire;	you	may	be	drowned	 in	water.	He	 is
referring	 to	your	 innermost	being	 --	of	which	you	are	unaware	 --	which	 is	 the
source	of	your	life.
In	 meditation	 you	 have	 to	 find	 that	 space,	 that	 clear	 sky,	 and	 then	 a
metamorphosis,	 a	 revolution,	 happens	 on	 its	 own	 accord.	 You	 start	 changing
without	any	effort	because	of	the	new	clarity,	the	new	light,	the	new	experience,
the	new	acquaintance	with	yourself.	The	whole	existence	becomes	new.
A	 man	 who	 knows	 himself	 cannot	 worship	 rats,	 a	 man	 who	 knows	 himself
cannot	worship	monkeys	or	elephants,	a	man	who	knows	himself	cannot	worship
at	all!	--	because	worship	is	outward.	He	cannot	pray	at	all,	because	all	prayers
are	addressed	 to	somebody	else.	He	can	only	meditate,	he	can	only	be	silently
drowned	in	his	own	splendor	--	which	is	not	his	own.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	8	-	Joy	in	the	morning
Slowly,	slowly	as	meditation	deepens	he	becomes	aware	that	it	is	the	splendor	of
our	whole	universe.
We	are	not	only	parts,	we	are	one	with	the	whole.	The	whole	expresses	itself	in
many	ways,	 then	 everything	becomes	divine;	 the	very	 earth	you	are	 sitting	on
becomes	divine,	and	whatever	you	are	doing	becomes	divine.	But	first	you	have
to	 find	 the	 divine	 element	 within	 yourself.	 It	 is	 not	 a	 belief	 system;	 it	 is	 an
inquiry,	it	is	as	scientific	an	investigation	as	any	science	can	claim.
In	 fact	 no	 science	 is	 as	 scientific	 as	meditation,	 because	 all	 sciences	 deny	 the
existence	 of	 the	 scientist.	 They	 are	 experimenting	 with	 things,	 but	 they	 don't
want	to	say	anything	about	who	is	working	inside	them,	about	what	it	is.	On	that
point	they	remain	absolutely	silent	because	it	cannot	be	made	objective,	it	cannot
be	put	on	 their	 table	 so	 they	can	dissect	 it	 and	 find	all	 the	elements	 in	 it;	 it	 is
non-material.
Hence	the	scientist	is	bound	to	remain	with	the	superstition	that	the	world	is	only
objective,	that	the	world	has	only	the	outside.	Can	you	see	the	irrationality	in	it?
The	outside	can	exist	only	if	there	is	an	inside.	If	you	deny	the	inside	you	cannot
accept	the	outside,	they	both	come	together.	The	mystic	is	more	scientific	in	the
way	he	accepts	the	beauty	of	the	world,	the	universe,	and	the	way	he	accepts	the
beauty	and	splendor	of	his	own	being.

Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
I	 CAN'T	 REMEMBER	WHEN	YOU	LAST	 PAUSED	TO	 LOOK	AT	YOUR
WATCH
TO	DECIDE	WHETHER	TO	SPEAK	FURTHER	OR	NOT.
DOES	THAT	MEAN	WE	HAVE	BEEN	JUICIER	TO	BE	WITH	LATELY?
Maneesha,	 it	 means	 many	 things.	 It	 certainly	 means	 that	 my	 assembly	 of
buddhas	 has	 become	 juicier,	 it	 has	 become	more	 alert,	 less	 judgmental,	 more
experimental.	 It	 also	means	 that	 when	 you	 are	 all	 so	 deeply	 involved,	 I	 don't
have	 to	 look	 at	my	watch.	When	 I	 see	 somebody	 disturbed,	 fidgeting,	 feeling
that	it	is	too	late,	only	then	have	I	looked	at	my	watch.
I	haven't	looked	at	it	for	years.
Sometimes	 it	doesn't	 show	the	 time	at	all,	 there	 is	nothing	 to	 look	at.	One	day
Shunyo	reminded	me,	"Your	watch	...	it	is	seven	and	your	watch	is	saying	four."
I	said,	"It	does	not	matter."
As	my	days	are	becoming	fewer	and	fewer	on	this	earth,	nothing	matters	except
one	thing:	that	I	should	pour	myself	into	you	as	much	as	possible.	Tomorrow	I
may	not	be	here,	so	I	should	complete	the	celebration	today.	Tomorrow	you	may
have	to	celebrate	alone.
The	whole	credit	goes	to	Ronald	Reagan.	Poisoning	me	he	has	taken	away	from
you	at	least	twenty	years	of	my	life.	I	am	fighting	with	the	poison	and	it	has	been
a	 good	 challenge	 for	me,	 but	 for	 you	 it	 can	 be	 a	 loss	 any	moment.	 I	 am	 just
living	on	the	fringe.	So	when	I	go	to	sleep	I	say	good-bye	to	the	world,	because	I
don't	know	for	certain	that	tomorrow	morning	I	will	wake	up.	When	I	wake	up	I
am	amazed	 that	 there	 is	one	more	day,	one	more	celebration,	one	more	day	 to
laugh	with	my	people,	 to	be	part	 of	 their	 silences,	 to	have	my	heart	 beat	with
their	hearts.	Looking	at	the	watch	has	become	irrelevant.
I	 go	on	wearing	 the	watch	 so	 that	you	don't	 become	afraid.	Because	 if	 I	 don't
wear	the	watch,	you	can	be	certain	that	my	time	is	up.
Now	something	really	serious:
Magnus	Marx	wants	to	buy	a	talking	parrot	for	his	wife's	birthday.	He	hears	that
a	rare	Brazilian	banana-parrot	is	being	auctioned,	so	he	goes	to	the	salesroom	to
have	a	look	at	it.
The	auctioneer	puts	the	bird	up	on	the	stand	in	front	of	the	crowded	sales	room.
"Twenty-five	dollars,"	bids	Magnus.

"Thirty-five!"	comes	another	bidder.
Magnus	bids	again,	"Forty	dollars!"
"Fifty!"	cries	the	other	bidder.
Ten	minutes	 later,	 a	 sweating	Magnus	 hands	 over	 two	 hundred	 dollars	 to	 the
auctioneer.
"That's	 a	 wonderful	 parrot	 you	 have	 bought,	 sir,"	 says	 the	 auctioneer	 as	 he
pockets	the	money.
"I	know	he	is	beautiful,"	agrees	Magnus.	"But	there	is	just	one	thing	I	forgot	to
ask	before
--	does	this	bird	talk?"
"Talk?"	 repeats	 the	 auctioneer.	 "For	 the	 last	 ten	 minutes	 he	 has	 been	 bidding

Sluggo,	 the	 deaf-mute	 gangster,	 is	 discovered	 to	 be	 stealing	 money	 regularly

Father	 Finger	 agrees	 to	 protect	 him,	 then	 arranges	 a	 meeting	 with	 the	 mafia
godfather.	The	mafia	chieftain,	upon	seeing	Sluggo,	becomes	so	enraged	that	he
pulls	out	his	pistol,	puts	it	against	Sluggo's	head	and	says	to	Father	Finger,	"Tell
him	that	if	he	does	not	say	where	that	million	dollars	is,	I	will	finish	him	right
here!"
"Did	you	say	one	million	dollars?"	asks	Father	Finger.
"Yeah,	 that's	 right,"	 shouts	 the	 fuming	ganglord,	waving	his	 gun	madly.	 "Now
tell	him	to	talk,	or	die!"
Finger	turns	to	Sluggo	and	signs	him	a	message.	The	deaf-mute,	trembling	with
fear,	signs	back	to	the	priest	that	the	money	is	hidden	in	a	cardboard	box	in	the
basement	of	his	apartment	building.
"Really?"	exclaims	Father	Finger	aloud.
"Well?"	roars	the	mafia	godfather.	"What	the	hell	is	he	saying?"
"He	says,"	replies	Father	Finger	quietly,	"that	you	don't	have	the	balls	to	pull	the
trigger!"

The	simple	task	of	turning	in
10	 August	 1988	 pm	 in	 Gautam	 the	 Buddha	 Auditorium	 OUR	 BELOVED
MASTER,
EJAKU	SAID:
LET	 EACH	 AND	 EVERY	 ONE	 OF	 YOU	 TURN	 THE	 LIGHT	 INWARDS
UPON
HIMSELF,	 AND	 NOT	 TRY	 TO	 MEMORIZE	 MY	 WORDS.	 SINCE	 TIME
WITHOUT
BEGINNING,	YOU	HAVE	TURNED	YOUR	BACK	UPON	THE	LIGHT	AND
RUN
AFTER	DARKNESS.	THE	HABITS	OF	ERRONEOUS	THINKING	ARE	SO
DEEP-ROOTED	 IN	YOU	THAT	 IT	WOULD	BE	EXTREMELY	DIFFICULT
TO	UPROOT
THEM	OVERNIGHT.	THIS	IS	WHY	ONE	IS	COMPELLED	TO	RESORT	TO
THE	USE
OF	MAKE-BELIEVE	EXPEDIENTS	IN	ORDER	TO	STRIP	YOU	OF	YOUR
CRUDE
WAYS	OF	THINKING.
THIS	IS	ON	A	PAR	WITH	WHAT	A	PARENT	SOMETIMES	WOULD	DO	IN
ORDER
TO	 STOP	 HIS	 LITTLE	 CHILD	 FROM	 CRYING	 --	 GIVING	 HIM	 SOME
YELLOW
LEAVES,	MAKING	BELIEVE	THAT	THEY	ARE	PRECIOUS	COINS.	 IT	 IS
ALSO	LIKE
A	MAN	SETTING	UP	A	STORE	STOCKED	WITH	ALL	KINDS	OF	GOODS
FOR	DAILY
USE,	 AS	 WELL	 AS	 ARTICLES	 OF	 GOLD	 AND	 JADE,	 TO
ACCOMMODATE
CUSTOMERS	 OF	 DIFFERENT	 ABILITIES.	 AS	 I	 HAVE	 OFTEN	 SAID,
SEKITO'S	 IS	 A	 GOLD	 SHOP,	 WHILE	 MINE	 IS	 A	 GENERAL	 STORE,
SELLING	ALL	AND	SUNDRY	...
BUT	 BUSINESS	 DEPENDS	 ON	 DEMAND.	 IF	 THERE	 IS	 NO	 DEMAND,
THERE	IS	NO
BUSINESS.
IF	I	DEALT	ONLY	WITH	THE	ESSENCE	OF	MEDITATION,	I	WOULD	BE
LEFT
ALL	ALONE.	EVEN	A	SINGLE	COMPANION	WOULD	BE	HARD	TO	GET,
TO	SAY
NOTHING	OF	A	COMMUNITY	OF	FIVE	OR	SEVEN	HUNDRED	MONKS.
IF,	ON	THE
OTHER	 HAND,	 I	 TALKED	 ABOUT	 THINGS	 OF	 EAST	 AND	 WEST,
PEOPLE	WOULD
COME	IN	FLOCKS,	PRICKING	UP	THEIR	EARS	TO	CATCH	EVERY	BIT
OF	MY
TALES.	THAT	WOULD	BE	LIKE	SHOWING	AN	EMPTY	FIST	TO	LITTLE
CHILDREN,	 PRETENDING	THAT	THERE	ARE	CANDIES	 IN	 IT.	 THIS	 IS
JUST	HUMBUG.
NOW,	LET	ME	TELL	YOU	IN	ALL	PLAINNESS:
DO	 NOT	 DIVERT	 YOUR	 MIND	 TO	 THE	 HOLY	 THINGS;	 RATHER,
DIRECT	IT	TO
YOUR	SELF-NATURE,	AND	CULTIVATE	YOURSELF	WITH	YOUR	FEET
ON	THE
GROUND.	DO	NOT	DESIRE	THE	THREE	"GIFTS	OF	VISION,"	AND	THE
SIX
"SUPERNATURAL	 POWERS."	 WHY?	 BECAUSE	 THESE	 ARE	 ONLY
ACCIDENTALS
OF	HOLINESS.
THE	ONE	THING	ESSENTIAL	NOW	IS	TO	RECOLLECT	YOUR	MIND	TO
ATTAIN
THE	 FUNDAMENTAL,	 THE	 VERY	 ROOT	 OF	 YOUR	 BEING.	 HAVING
ARRIVED	AT
THE	ROOT,	YOU	NEED	HAVE	NO	WORRY	ABOUT	THE	ACCIDENTALS.
IN	TIME
YOU	WILL	FIND	THAT	YOU	ARE	SELF-PROVIDED	WITH	ALL	THESE
ACCIDENTAL	GIFTS	AND	POWERS.	ON	THE	OTHER	HAND,	SO	LONG
AS	YOU
Osho	-	The	Miracle

HAVE	NOT	GOT	AT	THE	ROOT,	YOU	WILL	NOT	BE	ABLE	TO	ACQUIRE
SUCH
GIFTS	AND	POWERS	THROUGH	STUDY	AND	LEARNING.
Maneesha,	basically	there	is	only	one	way	of	discovering	the	buddha,	 the	truth
of	 your	 very	 being.	 But	 there	 are	 thousands	 of	 people	with	 different	 states	 of
consciousness;	hence	for	 them,	different	devices,	different	small	streets	 joining
to	the	main	way,	have	to	be	created.
That's	what	all	the	Zen	masters	in	the	fourteen-hundred-year	history	of	Zen	have
been	trying	very	diligently	to	do.
No	 one	 is	 being	 left	 out;	 everybody	 is	 shown	 a	 way	 that	 may	 fit	 them.	 But
finally,	whatever	 fits	 you	will	 lead	 you	 to	 the	 ultimate	way:	 turning	 in.	 Every
device	is	dedicated	to	the	simple	task	of	turning	in.
As	the	situation	is,	man	is	born	with	five	senses	which	all	go	outwards.	Nature
has	not	given	you	a	special	sense	that	goes	inwards.
Your	eyes	open	outwards;	if	you	close	them	there	is	only	darkness.	Or	even	with
closed	 eyes	 you	 will	 still	 see	 things	 of	 the	 outside	 world	 as	 imagination,	 as
dreams.	Ears	 can	hear	only	 the	music	 that	 comes	 from	 the	outside;	 they	know
nothing	about	 the	music	 that	 is	continuously	happening	within	you.	Nobody	 is
born	with	an	ear	 to	hear	 the	 inner	music.	Your	hands	stretch	outside.	Even	 the
smallest	child	starts	grabbing	outside	things.
Obviously	 this	 state	 of	 affairs,	 that	 all	 our	 senses	 open	 outwards,	 has	 been
exploited.	We	have	been	given	every	kind	of	theology,	religion,	 truth,	from	the
outside,	 because	 that	 is	 what	 we	 are	 demanding.	We	 want	 a	 God	 to	 be	 there
above	 in	 the	 sky.	We	want	 anything	 and	 immediately	 there	will	 be	 a	 supplier.
You	just	have	to	ask	and	somebody	will	create	a	system	of	beliefs	to	satisfy	you.
Zen	cuts	all	this	rubbish	like	a	sharp	sword	in	one	single	blow.	It	has	nothing	to
do	with	anything	that	takes	you	away	from	you;	it	may	be	God,	it	may	be	hell,	it
may	be	heaven	--	all	kinds	of	rewards	and	all	kinds	of	fears	about	punishment.
All	the	religions	are	living	on	the	exploitation	of	your	senses	because	they	open
outwards.
The	work	of	a	real	master	is	to	close	all	these	doors	so	that	your	life	energy,	your
consciousness,	does	not	leak	out.	There	is	no	naturally	given	way	to	go	inwards,
but	it	is	not	needed.	If	enough	consciousness	is	gathered	in,	it	will	create	its	own
way,	 just	 as	water	 creates	 its	 own	way	 --	 no	map,	 no	 guidelines,	 just	 enough
quantity	and	the	water	will	start	flowing	towards	an	unknown	sea.	It	has	never
heard	about,	knows	nothing	about,	where	it	is	going.
The	 same	 is	 true	 about	 consciousness.	 Enough	 consciousness	 gathered	 inside
immediately	 makes	 a	 way	 upon	 which	 nobody	 has	 ever	 trodden,	 and	 starts
moving	 inwards.	Outward	 senses	 are	 closed;	 that's	what	 I	mean	when	 I	 say	 in
your	 meditations	 to	 close	 your	 eyes,	 to	 leave	 the	 body	 completely	 behind	 ...
because	all	the	senses	are	joined	with	the	body.	Just	be	a	watcher	of	the	mind,	so
the	 mind	 cannot	 take	 your	 energy	 outside.	 With	 body	 and	 mind	 both	 closed
energy	gathers	upon	itself	spontaneously,	and	at	a	certain	point	it	starts	moving
inwards.	You	don't	have	to	do	anything	except	to	close	all	the	doors	that	lead	you
away	from	yourself.
It	is	one	of	the	simplest	things	because	you	don't	have	to	do	it.	But	just	because
of	 its	 simplicity,	 its	 obviousness,	 it	 has	 become	 difficult	 --	 the	most	 difficult,
because	nobody	can	teach	you;	nobody	can	indicate	to	you	where	to	move,	how
to	 move.	 The	 master	 can	 only	 create	 a	 situation	 in	 which	 the	 spontaneous
movement	of	the	energy	will	happen.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	9	-	The	simple	task	of	turning	in
That's	 what	 I	 call	 meditation.	 It	 is	 not	 your	 doing.	 You	 have	 to	 stop	 doing
everything.	It	is	your	non-doing.
And	the	moment	when	you	are	not	doing,	all	your	energy	that	was	involved	in
doing	a	thousand	and	one	things	is	released.	It	gathers	to	a	point	where	it	starts
flowing	inwards,	and	the	innermost	center	is	not	far	away.
Meditation	is,	in	a	way,	going	beyond	nature.	Hence	it	is	called	transcendental.
Nature	 has	 not	 provided	 any	 automatic	way,	 like	 it	 has	 provided	 eyes,	 hands,
ears;	 it	 has	 not	 provided	 any	 way	 for	 your	 energy	 to	 go	 in.	 Meditation	 is
transcending	the	natural	gifts,	moving	beyond	nature.	It	is	not	against	nature,	it	is
simply	towards	a	greater	nature,	more	overwhelming,	more	universal.
And	once	you	have	found	the	way	and	you	have	touched	your	own	being,	you
have	gone	through	a	magic.	You	will	never	be	the	same	person	again.	Not	only
that,	the	world	that	surrounds	you	will	never	be	the	same	again.	Now	your	love
will	 have	 a	 new	 fragrance	 --	 not	 the	 old	 possessiveness,	 domination.	 Your
friendship	will	be	more	friendliness	than	friendship.
It	will	not	have	any	bondage,	any	conditionings.	Your	vision	of	 the	world	will
become	immensely	intense	and	sharp.	You	will	see	things	which	have	been	there
always,	present,	but	you	were	not	present.
Each	flower	 is	showing	something	of	 the	divine.	Each	star	 is	shining,	showing
something	of	 the	divine.	The	whole	existence	in	 its	multitude	of	expressions	is
showing	only	the	divine,	but	you	will	recognize	it	only	on	the	condition	that	you
have	recognized	it	within	yourself.
Then	you	know	 that	your	center	 is	not	only	your	center,	 it	 is	 the	center	of	 the
whole	universe.
We	are	all	joined	in	this	center.
It	 is	 said	about	Bacon	--	a	great	 scientific	 thinker,	perhaps	 the	most	 important,
because	he	turned	the	whole	human	mind	from	religion	to	science	...	He	used	to
say,	"If	I	can	find	the	center	of	the	world	I	can	move	the	world	according	to	me."
But	 he	 never	 found	 the	 center	 of	 the	world,	 and	 I	 say	 unto	 you	 he	 has	 never
heard	that	in	the	East	we	have	been	searching	not	the	center	of	the	world	but	the
center	of	ourselves.	Finding	the	center	of	ourselves	we	have	found	the	center	of
the	universe.	But	then	the	desire	for	change	drops.	The	universe	is	so	beautiful,
nothing	needs	to	be	changed;	everything	has	to	be	rejoiced	and	celebrated.
These	statements	of	a	great	master	Ejaku	are	very	fundamental.
EJAKU	SAID:
LET	 EACH	 AND	 EVERY	 ONE	 OF	 YOU	 TURN	 THE	 LIGHT	 INWARDS
UPON
HIMSELF,	AND	NOT	TRY	TO	MEMORIZE	MY	WORDS.
Only	a	very	great	master	can	say	 that	 --	don't	bother	about	my	words,	because
they	don't	contain	the	truth.	No	words	can	contain	it,	so	don't	memorize	them.	I
am	saying	to	you,	"Turn	in."	But	you	can	do	two	things:	you	can	memorize	the
words	 "turn	 in"	 or	 you	 can	 do	 another	 thing	 ...	 existentially,	 you	 can	 turn	 in.
That's	what	Ejaku	is	saying:	"I	am	not	saying	these	words	to	you	so	that	you	can
memorize	my	words."
SINCE	TIME	WITHOUT	BEGINNING,	YOU	HAVE	TURNED	YOUR	BACK
UPON
THE	 LIGHT	 AND	 RUN	 AFTER	 DARKNESS.	 THE	 HABITS	 OF
ERRONEOUS
THINKING	 ARE	 SO	 DEEP-ROOTED	 IN	 YOU	 THAT	 IT	 WOULD	 BE
EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT	TO	UPROOT	THEM	OVERNIGHT.
Osho	-	The	Miracle

Chapter	9	-	The	simple	task	of	turning	in
It	is	obviously	true,	but	with	great	respect	to	Ejaku	I	disagree.
However	many	lives	you	may	have	been	wandering	outside,	it	does	not	matter.
You	can	come	 to	yourself	 in	a	 single	moment.	 It	 is	 just	 like	a	man	asleep.	He
may	be	anywhere	in	the	world,	visiting	Moscow	or	Peking	or	Tokyo	or	going	to
the	moon	--	just	wake	him	up.	Do	you	think	he	will	say,	"Wait,	I	have	to	catch	a
train	 to	come	back	from	Tokyo?"	Or,	"From	Moscow	I	have	 to	 take	a	plane;	 I
cannot	just	wake	up	immediately."	He	does	not	say	that,	he	simply	wakes	up	and
wonders	...	instantaneously.	The	projection	is	a	dream.	All	our	projections	--	of
greed,	lust,	power,	anger	--	are	simply	dreams.
Ejaku	 is	 right	as	a	common-sense	approach.	But	 I	don't	agree,	because	I	know
you	 can	 be	 a	 buddha	 this	 very	moment.	All	 the	wanderings	 in	 past	 lives	 into
darkness	cannot	prevent	you.	It	is	like	saying	a	room	has	been	dark	for	centuries
and	you	bring	a	small	candlelight	 ...	 the	darkness	cannot	say,	"I	will	not	go	so
immediately.	I	have	been	here	occupying	this	room	for	centuries.	It	goes	against
the	 constitution	 of	 India;	 you	 cannot	 throw	 away	 the	 occupant	 in	 a	 single
moment.	Go	through	a	proper	channel.	First	go	to	the	court,	claim	that	you	have
the	right."	But	the	darkness	does	not	say	anything.	You	just	bring	a	small	candle,
and	the	darkness	disappears.
In	 fact	 the	darkness	has	no	substance.	 It	 is	an	absence.	So	when	you	bring	 the
light,	the	absence	disappears;	it	was	the	absence	of	the	light.
If	you	can	go	in,	pushing	aside	the	whole	crowd	of	habits	--	just	like	an	arrow,
with	force,	gathering	your	whole	energy	inwards	--	you	can	prove	Ejaku	wrong.
Although	what	he	is	saying	is	out	of	compassion,	perhaps	most	people	will	have
to	follow	what	he	is	saying.
THE	 HABITS	 OF	 ERRONEOUS	 THINKING	 ARE	 SO	 DEEP-ROOTED	 IN
YOU	THAT
IT	 WOULD	 BE	 EXTREMELY	 DIFFICULT	 TO	 UPROOT	 THEM
OVERNIGHT.
I	 say	 unto	 you	 it	 is	 extremely	 simple	 to	 throw	 them	 this	 very	moment.	Those
habits	have	been	formed	in	darkness	and	unconsciousness;	 they	don't	have	any
substance	in	them.
I	was	talking	to	a	friend.	He	was	a	professor	in	the	same	university	I	was,	and	he
was	continuously	harassing	me	 --	 "Do	 something!	 I	want	 to	drop	 this	habit	 of
smoking.	 Many	 times	 I	 try:	 one	 hour,	 two	 hours,	 three	 hours,	 and	 then	 it
becomes	too	much.	The	urge	...	I	think,	'It	is	better	to	have	a	cigarette.	Next	time
we	will	try	in	better	conditions;	right	now	I	am	too	tense.'	So	many	times	I	have
decided,	but	it	fails.	Every	time,	rather	than	being	a	success	it	has	been	a	failure,
and	now	it	has	become	written	in	my	memory	that	I	cannot	succeed.	Just	show
me	how	to	drop	it."
I	said,	"Are	you	ready?"
He	said,	"I	am	ready	to	do	anything."
Then	I	said,	"Do	one	thing.	Come	with	me	to	my	home,	and	I	will	not	let	you	out
until	this	habit	is	gone."
He	said,	"What	do	you	mean?	Are	you	going	to	torture	me	or	something?"
I	said,	"No	torture,	just	chain	smoking.	Sitting	before	me	you	have	to	smoke	to
your	heart's	content."
He	 said,	 "I	 never	 heard	 such	 a	 thing	 from	 anybody	 else.	 I	 have	 been	 talking
about	dropping	this	habit."
Osho	-	The	Miracle
117
Chapter	9	-	The	simple	task	of	turning	in
I	said,	"You	have	been	bragging.	All	this	talk	about	dropping	this	habit	is	just	a
strategy	of	the	mind	to	brag	that	'I	am	trying,	but	what	to	do?'	But	today	you	are
caught	in	a	lion's	den.
Just	come	and	sit	behind	me	in	my	car	and	forget	the	world.	On	the	way	we	will
purchase	cigarettes	--	as	many	as	the	car	can	contain."
He	said,	"My	God,	you	will	kill	me!"
I	 said,	 "It	 does	 not	 matter.	 Either	 you	 will	 leave	 dead	 or	 you	 will	 leave	 the
habit!"
Hesitantly,	afraid,	he	said,	"I	always	have	heard	that	you	are	a	strange	type,	but	I
never	thought	that	 just	by	telling	you	I	would	get	 trapped.	Do	you	really	mean
it?"
I	said,	"Just	sit	down	in	the	car,	and	on	the	way	I	will	fill	the	whole	car	..."
He	was	 looking	at	me	and	he	said,	 "What	are	you	doing?	That	much	smoking
will	kill	me!"
I	said,	"There	is	no	way	out	now.	Chain	smoking	means	chain	smoking.	When
you	 drop	 one	 cigarette,	 immediately	 take	 another;	 take	 the	 fire	 from	 the	 first
cigarette	to	the	second	cigarette.	And	I	will	be	watching."
Just	after	three	or	four	packets	he	said,	"Can	I	go	home,	before	..."
"No	way!	Either	your	dead	body	will	go	out,	or	you	will	have	to	drop	this	habit
that	you	have	been	bragging	about."
He	said,	"I	promise."
I	said,	"I	don't	want	to	interfere	in	anybody	else's	life,	but	you	offered	yourself."
He	burned	his	lips,	he	burned	his	hands.	It	must	have	taken	about	six	hours,	and
after	 six	 hours	 he	was	 so	 tired	 ...	 smoking	 and	 smoking.	And	 a	 crowd	 of	 the
neighbors	gathered,	and	they	started	talking	--	"Is	this	man	mad	or	something?"
And	all	over,	cigarettes	and	ashes.
Finally	he	said,	"Let	me	go!"
I	said,	"I	will	not	let	you	go.	Do	you	see	my	guard?	He	will	put	you	back	in	your
place,	and	if	you	don't	smoke	he	will	force	you	to	smoke.	This	time	or	never!"
He	said,	"It	is	better	I	drop	this	habit.	But	let	me	go	home!"
I	said,	"Be	a	man	of	your	word.	If	you	are	found	smoking	again	you	will	have	to
commit	 suicide	 --	 hara-kiri.	 A	man	 of	 his	 word	 has	 no	 other	 way.	 If	 he	 goes
against	his	word,	he	has	to	commit	hara-kiri."
He	 said,	 "I	 promise.	 I	will	 commit	 hara-kiri,	 but	 at	 least	 right	 now	 let	me	 go
home!"
I	followed	him	for	many	days.	He	tried	to	escape,	he	wouldn't	 look	at	me.	But
when	I	take	something	into	my	hands	I	do	it.
I	used	to	go	every	day	to	his	home	to	ask	his	wife	how	things	were	going.	She
was	 of	 course	 on	my	 side;	 she	was	my	detective	 in	 his	 home.	Even	 the	 small
children	of	the	poor	professor	were	all	working	for	me.	They	would	say,	"Uncle,
you	have	done	a	miracle!	He	 is	so	afraid.	Even	 to	mention	 the	word	 'cigarette'
and	 he	 starts	 perspiring.	 That	 experience	 you	 have	 given	 him	 ...	 Since	 that
experience	 --	 we	 don't	 know	 what	 experience,	 he	 simply	 says,	 'Since	 that
experience	 I	 am	 finished.	Because	 that	man	 is	 so	dangerous,	 if	 I	 even	 touch	a
cigarette	he	will	force	me	to	commit	hara-kiri.	And	I	want	to	live,	cigarettes	or
no	cigarettes.'"
The	question	 is,	 if	 you	have	 really	decided,	 if	 you	 are	 in	 an	honest	 search	 for
yourself,	 then	you	can	prove	Ejaku	wrong.	And	I	would	like	you	to	prove	him
wrong,	although	he	is	making	Osho	-	The	Miracle
118
Chapter	9	-	The	simple	task	of	turning	in
a	very	common-sense	statement.	Ordinarily	it	takes	lives	to	drop	old	habits.	But
that	simply	means	you	are	not	really	wanting	to	drop	them.	If	you	want	to	drop,
it	 takes	 only	 a	 simple,	 single	 moment,	 because	 all	 old	 habits	 are	 your	 own
projections.
THIS	IS	WHY	ONE	IS	COMPELLED	TO	RESORT	TO	THE	USE	OF	MAKE-
BELIEVE
EXPEDIENTS	 IN	 ORDER	 TO	 STRIP	 YOU	 OF	 YOUR	 CRUDE	WAYS	 OF
THINKING.
THIS	IS	ON	A	PAR	WITH	WHAT	A	PARENT	SOMETIMES	WOULD	DO	IN
ORDER
TO	 STOP	 HIS	 LITTLE	 CHILD	 FROM	 CRYING	 --	 GIVING	 HIM	 SOME
YELLOW
LEAVES,	MAKING	BELIEVE	THAT	THEY	ARE	PRECIOUS	COINS.	 IT	 IS
ALSO	LIKE
A	MAN	SETTING	UP	A	STORE	STOCKED	WITH	ALL	KINDS	OF	GOODS
FOR	DAILY
USE,	 AS	 WELL	 AS	 ARTICLES	 OF	 GOLD	 AND	 JADE,	 TO
ACCOMMODATE
CUSTOMERS	 OF	 DIFFERENT	 ABILITIES.	 AS	 I	 HAVE	 OFTEN	 SAID,
SEKITO'S	IS	A	GOLD	SHOP,	WHILE	MINE	IS	A	GENERAL	STORE	...
Sekito	is	sitting	here	in	front	of	me,	behind	the	camera.	In	this	new	reincarnation
he	is	called	Niskriya,	the	Stonehead.	Sekito	means	the	Stonehead.	He	was	a	great
master.
Ejaku	says	that	Sekito	has	a	gold	shop	--	only	very	refined	people	can	become
his	 disciples.	Ordinary	 ones	 are	 simply	 given	 a	 good	 beating	 and	 thrown	 out.
They	never	come	back	to	Sekito's	temple.	Only	very	rare,	extraordinary	seekers
will	take	all	the	beatings	but	will	not	leave	the	steps.	Sometimes	it	happened	that
a	person	would	sit	there	for	months	before	Sekito	would	allow	him	to	come	in.	It
may	 be	 raining,	 it	 may	 be	 winter,	 it	 may	 be	 summer,	 but	 unless	 Sekito	 is
convinced	that	the	man	has	a	will,	that	he	has	not	come	just	out	of	curiosity	but
in	every	way	he	wants	to	seek	and	search	himself	...
...	WHILE	MINE	IS	A	GENERAL	STORE,	SELLING	ALL	AND	SUNDRY.
Ejaku	was	a	different	kind	of	master	--	not	hard,	he	never	hit	anybody.	He	never
slapped	 any	 disciple.	Naturally	 he	 attracted	 the	wishy-washy	 people.	 But	 in	 a
general	store	you	cannot	find	great	shoppers	like	Avirbhava.	Now	she	has	gone
to	Hong	Kong	to	find	other	gods	worshipped	in	the	past,	because	there	is	going
to	be	a	fair	of	toys.	She	is	not	here	today.
Yesterday	 she	 did	 her	 show	 of	 the	 great	 rat.	 Now	 she	 has	 gone	 in	 search	 of
finding	something	even	greater.
Ejaku	is	saying,	"I	serve	all	and	sundry;	even	the	curious	ones	are	accepted.	One
never	knows:	today	the	person	may	be	curious,	tomorrow	he	may	become	really
a	longing.	A	chance	has	to	be	given."
Both	are	right.	Sekito	works	on	the	very	special	ones;	Ejaku	works	on	everyone,
of	any	category.	Both	are	needed.
IF	I	DEALT	ONLY	WITH	THE	ESSENCE	OF	MEDITATION,	I	WOULD	BE
LEFT
ALL	ALONE.
To	deal	with	the	essence	of	meditation	alone	...	that's	what	I	am	doing.	But	even
dealing	 only	with	meditation,	 I	 don't	 have	 a	 general	 store.	 I	 have	my	ways	 of
choosing	the	best	and	the	most	intelligent.	Just	because	of	my	words,	those	who
are	curious	will	not	stay	here.	There	is	nothing	for	them	here.
Those	who	 have	 stayed	with	me	 have	 stayed	 because	 they	 started	 feeling	 the
essence	of	meditation,	slowly	slowly,	like	a	cool	breeze	or	a	full-moon	night	or	a
roseflower	 in	 all	 its	 beauty.	 They	 have	 found	 something,	 and	 now	 they	 are
certain	 there	 is	much	more.	This	certainty	creates	 trust.	And	without	 this	 trust,
Ejaku	is	right:	if	a	man	simply	deals	with	Osho	-	The	Miracle
119
Chapter	9	-	The	simple	task	of	turning	in
meditation	he	will	be	left	alone,	because	who	wants	meditation?	And	when	there
is	no	demand,	what	is	the	point	of	keeping	the	store	open?
I	 have	 tried	 in	 a	 unique	 way	 to	 call	 forth	 from	 all	 over	 the	 world	 the	 most
intelligent	ones.	I	am	not	alone.	It	is	not	only	that	you	are	here	--	there	are	two
million	 people	 around	 the	 earth	 who	 are	 meditating,	 whose	 only	 concern	 is
meditation;	everything	else	in	life	has	become	meaningless.
But	 Ejaku	 is	 making	 a	 common	 sense	 statement:	 if	 you	 deal	 only	 with
meditation,	 people	 will	 desert	 you.	 Seeing	 this,	 masters	 deal	 with	 scriptures,
mantras,	to	keep	you	engaged.	Some	day	may	come	the	right	moment	that	you
can	be	introduced	into	meditation.
I	am	totally	different	from	Sekito	or	Ejaku,	although	I	am	doing	the	same	work.
But	 neither	 do	 I	 hit	 you,	 nor	 do	 I	 push	 you	 away,	 nor	 do	 I	 wait.	 I	 make	 the
atmosphere	available	to	you.	All	kinds	of	people,	in	this	atmosphere,	can	have	a
little	experience.	And	that	little	experience	starts	growing	just	like	a	seed	grows
into	a	huge	cedar,	aspiring	to	the	stars.
Those	who	were	more	 concerned	with	 non-essentials	 have	 come	 and	 gone.	 In
these	thirty	years	thousands	of	people	have	passed	--	but	now,	as	we	are	coming
to	 the	 most	 precious	 experience,	 deeper	 and	 deeper,	 only	 those	 who	 are
authentically	interested	in	digging	for	the	gold	have	remained.
Now	this	assembly	has	become	one	of	the	greatest	assemblies	of	seekers	that	has
ever	been	on	the	earth.
Ejaku	 says:	 IF	 I	DEALT	ONLY	WITH	THE	ESSENCE	OF	MEDITATION,	 I
WOULD
BE	LEFT	ALL	ALONE.
Ordinarily	that	is	true.
EVEN	 A	 SINGLE	 COMPANION	 WOULD	 BE	 HARD	 TO	 GET,	 TO	 SAY
NOTHING	OF
A	 COMMUNITY	OF	 FIVE	 OR	 SEVEN	HUNDRED	MONKS.	 IF,	 ON	 THE
OTHER	 HAND,	 I	 TALKED	 ABOUT	 THINGS	 OF	 EAST	 AND	 WEST,
PEOPLE	WOULD	COME	IN
FLOCKS,	 PRICKING	 UP	 THEIR	 EARS	 TO	 CATCH	 EVERY	 BIT	 OF	 MY
TALES.	THAT
WOULD	BE	 LIKE	 SHOWING	AN	EMPTY	 FIST	 TO	LITTLE	CHILDREN,
PRETENDING
THAT	THERE	ARE	CANDIES	IN	IT.	THIS	IS	JUST	HUMBUG.
He	is	very	honest.	He	is	saying,	"I	have	to	create	all	kinds	of	things,	but	all	those
things	are	just	humbug."	Just	as	you	can	engage	a	child	with	toys	and	he	forgets
that	 he	 was	 crying,	 you	 can	 engage	 thousands	 of	 people	 ...	 in	 fact	 they	 are
engaged.	What	are	the	churches	doing,	what	are	the	synagogues	doing,	what	are
the	temples	doing?	Dealing	with	non-essentials.	And	flocks	of	millions	of	people
...	And	these	holy	places	and	these	so-called	great	priests	go	on	watching	what
the	 need	 of	 the	 people	 is.	 They	 immediately	 supply	 their	 need,	 so	 that	 they
remain	entangled	in	the	net	of	Hinduism	or	Christianity	or	Judaism.
I	have	heard	 that	 three	 rabbis	were	 talking	about	 their	congregations.	The	 first
rabbi	said,
"My	congregation	is	the	most	up-to-date.	You	can	even	smoke	cigarettes	inside
the	synagogue.	You	can	play	cards	and	gamble."
The	second	one	said,	"That	is	nothing.	In	my	synagogue	I	have	already	entered
the	twenty-first	century.	People	can	make	love	and	do	whatever	they	want	to	do.
They	can	drink	wine,	they	can	dance.	After	all,	one	has	to	have	a	congregation;
otherwise	we	will	lose	our	profession,	our	salaries.	So	whatever	they	want	to	do,
let	them	do."
Osho	-	The	Miracle
120
Chapter	9	-	The	simple	task	of	turning	in
The	third	one	said,	"That's	nothing.	In	my	synagogue	there	is	a	sign	in	front	of
the	synagogue	on	which	it	is	written,	'This	synagogue	is	closed	on	Saturdays	and
all	 Jewish	holidays.'"	What	more	do	you	want?	This	 is	 the	most	ultra-modern!
People	are	happy,	very	much	rejoiced,	 to	be	members	of	a	synagogue	which	is
always	closed,	which	does	not	bother	them	at	all	with	old	sermons.
But	all	the	religions	have	been	keeping	people	engaged	with	the	non-essentials.
Ejaku	 is	very	 sincere.	He	 says,	 "It	 is	not	 in	my	capacity	 to	deal	only	with	 the
essential	Zen.
I	 know	 that	 I	will	 not	 find	 even	 a	 single	 companion.	 So	 I	 go	 on	 giving	 them
devices,	scriptures,	mantras	and	all	kinds	of	things	--	a	general	store.	But	it	is	all
humbug."
Do	you	know	what	 'humbug'	means?	It	was	Charles	Darwin's	sixtieth	birthday,
and	he	was	very	friendly	with	children.	So	all	the	children	of	the	neighborhood
decided,	 "Precious	 presents	 will	 be	 coming	 to	 the	 great	 scientist.	 We	 poor
children,	 what	 can	 we	 do?	 But	 something	 has	 to	 be	 presented	 to	 the	 great
scientist	who	 is	 our	 friend."	So	one	 small	 boy	 came	up	with	 a	 great	 idea,	 and
they	managed	it.	They	found	all	kinds	of	insects	...	because	that	was	the	interest
of	 Charles	 Darwin.	Working	 out	 his	 theory	 of	 evolution,	 he	was	 looking	 into
insects,	into	animals,	in	every	place.
What	they	did	was	cut	up	all	those	insects	and	made	a	new	insect.	The	body	of
one	insect,	the	legs	of	another,	the	face	of	a	third,	the	tail	of	a	fourth	...	and	they
made	 it	 so	 perfectly	 and	 beautifully	 that	 anybody	 could	 be	 deceived.	 They
brought	 their	 present	 to	 the	great	Darwin	 and	 asked	him,	 "Uncle,	 can	you	 say
what	it	is?	You	are	such	a	great	scientist,	you	must	know	the	name."
He	looked	and	he	could	not	imagine	...	He	had	never	come	across	such	an	insect.
He	looked	again	and	again,	and	then	finally	he	saw	that	it	was	not	one	insect	--
the	legs	are	different,	the	tail	is	different,	the	head	is	different.	But	the	boys	had
done	a	great	artistic	job,	so	he	said,	"This	is	a	humbug.	Its	name	is	humbug."
Most	of	the	people	are	humbugs.	They	are	carrying	something	from	somebody,
something	from	somebody	else.	They	are	not	themselves,	they	are	many	people,
a	multitude.	They	are	a	crowd.
Says	Ejaku:
NOW,	LET	ME	TELL	YOU	IN	ALL	PLAINNESS:	DO	NOT	DIVERT	YOUR
MIND	TO
THE	 HOLY	 THINGS;	 RATHER,	 DIRECT	 IT	 TO	 YOUR	 SELF-NATURE,
AND
CULTIVATE	YOURSELF	WITH	YOUR	FEET	ON	THE	GROUND.	DO	NOT
DESIRE
THE	 THREE	 "GIFTS	 OF	 VISION,"	 AND	 THE	 SIX	 "SUPERNATURAL
POWERS."	WHY?
BECAUSE	THESE	ARE	ONLY	ACCIDENTALS	OF	HOLINESS.
THE	ONE	THING	ESSENTIAL	NOW	IS	TO	RECOLLECT	YOUR	MIND	TO
ATTAIN
THE	 FUNDAMENTAL,	 THE	 VERY	 ROOT	 OF	 YOUR	 BEING.	 HAVING
ARRIVED	AT
THE	ROOT,	YOU	NEED	HAVE	NO	WORRY	ABOUT	THE	ACCIDENTALS.
All	 the	virtues	come	on	 their	own	as	you	become	conscious,	 so	don't	cultivate
those	virtues.	They	will	be	artificial	and	they	will	become	preventive,	hindrances
on	the	way	to	your	own	self.

Chapter	9	-	The	simple	task	of	turning	in
Don't	ask	for	miracles.	A	man	of	meditation	 is	himself	a	miracle.	Whatever	he
does	 is	 a	miracle.	 It	 is	 a	beauty,	 it	 is	magic,	but	 it	 is	 all	 spontaneous.	 It	 is	not
practiced,	it	is	not	rehearsed.
But	 most	 people	 are	 interested	 in	 supernatural	 powers,	 healing	 people	 with
supernatural	powers,	or	creating	things	out	of	nothing,	just	as	Satya	Sai	Baba	is
doing.	All	kinds	of	frauds	...	but	people	become	interested	in	them,	thinking	that
here	is	a	man	of	miracles.	And	what	is	 the	miracle	if	you	can	produce	a	Swiss
watch	which	was	hiding	in	your	sleeve	...?
One	old	Parsi	woman	came	to	me	in	Bombay.	Satya	Sai	Baba	used	to	stay	at	her
place,	and	she	told	me,	"One	day	when	he	had	gone	into	the	bathroom,	just	out
of	curiosity	I	looked	into	his	suitcases.	They	were	all	full	of	watches!	I	could	not
believe	that	this	man	was	deceiving."
She	said,	"I	kicked	him	out.	I	told	him,	'Never	again	come	in	my	house!'	I	cannot
be	a	partner	 to	any	kind	of	fraud."	She	 told	me,	"I	am	an	old	woman.	Nobody
listens	to	me,	they	think	I	have	gone	senile.	I	have	come	to	you	...	perhaps	you
can	do	something	about	it."
I	said,	"I	have	been	challenging	Satya	Sai	Baba,	saying	that	this	is	stupid.	When
the	country	is	dying	of	starvation,	produce	more	food	out	of	your	miracles.	He
should	bring	rain	to	Hyderabad"	...	where	the	Shankaracharya	of	Puri	is	going	to
force	a	woman	to	be	burned	alive	on	her	husband's	funeral	pyre,	and	only	then
rain	will	come.	And	Satya	Sai	Baba	is	not	far	away	from	Hyderabad.	Bring	rain
to	Hyderabad	--	do	some	real	work!	All	that	he	produces	is	ash,	and	he	gives	you
the	ash	and	you	think	it	is	great.	It	is	so	simple	that	any	street	magician	can	do	it.
In	fact	the	more	experienced	street	magicians	can	do	it	 in	a	far	better	way,	and
can	do	many	more	things	than	he	is	doing.
I	 have	 no	 objection	 to	 him	 as	 a	 magician,	 but	 he	 should	 not	 pretend	 to	 be	 a
spiritual	 man.	 It	 is	 not	 only	 a	 question	 of	 a	 single	 person	 pretending	 to	 be
spiritual	when	 he	 is	 not.	 The	 question	 is	 that	 he	 attracts	 thousands	 of	 people,
mediocre	people,	who	believe	that	this	man	of	miracles	may	impart	something	to
them,	may	lead	them	to	the	ultimate	truth.
Ejaku	 is	 right:	 don't	 bother	 about	 supernatural	 powers,	 THREE	 "GIFTS	 OF
VISION."
THE	ONE	THING	ESSENTIAL	NOW	IS	TO	RECOLLECT	YOUR	MIND	TO
ATTAIN
THE	 FUNDAMENTAL,	 THE	 VERY	 ROOT	 OF	 YOUR	 BEING.	 HAVING
ARRIVED	AT
THE	ROOT,	YOU	NEED	HAVE	NO	WORRY	ABOUT	THE	ACCIDENTALS.
IN	TIME
YOU	WILL	FIND	THAT	YOU	ARE	SELF-PROVIDED	WITH	ALL	THESE
ACCIDENTAL	GIFTS	AND	POWERS.	ON	THE	OTHER	HAND,	SO	LONG
AS	YOU
HAVE	NOT	GOT	 THE	 ROOT,	 YOU	WILL	NOT	 BE	ABLE	 TO	ACQUIRE
SUCH	GIFTS
AND	POWERS	THROUGH	STUDY	AND	LEARNING.
A	very	honest	man,	saying	simply	two	things:	one,	 turn	your	 lights	 in;	second,
don't	 be	 concerned	 with	 accidentals,	 non-essentials.	 As	 you	 become	 an
enlightened	man,	miracles	follow	you	like	a	shadow.	You	don't	have	to	do	them,
they	happen	around	you,	in	your	very	air.
And	 the	 greatest	miracle	 is	 that	whoever	 comes	 in	 contact	with	 the	 awakened
one	tastes	for	the	first	time	the	sweetness	of	awakening,	the	grace	of	awakening,
and	a	longing	arises	in	him	which	he	has	never	thought	about	--	to	be	a	buddha
himself.
The	greatest	miracle	 in	 the	world	 is	 to	bring	people	 to	 the	 recognition	of	 their
buddhahood.

Everything	 is	 dust	 once	 you	 understand	 yourself.	 And	 the	 moment	 you

don't	 get	 lost	 in	 the	 crowd	 and	 its	 stupid	 ideologies.	You	 become	 for	 the	 first

a	Christian.	You	simply	belong	to	the	universe.	You	are	a	universal	man.	This	is
the	greatest	miracle.
Another	Zen	poem,	by	Nensho:

ONLY	FOOLS	SEEK	SAINTHOOD	FOR	REWARD.
LIFTING	A	HAND,
THE	STONE	LANTERN	ANNOUNCES	DAYBREAK.
SMILING,	THE	VOID	NODS	ITS	ENORMOUS	HEAD.
What	Nensho	 is	 saying	 is:	Why	are	you	 trying	 to	be	a	 saint?	 --	because	 saints
will	 be	 rewarded	 in	 heaven.	 All	 your	 virtues	 are	 just	 making	 a	 way	 towards
paradise,	where	you	will	be	provided	all	kinds	of	pleasures.	What	are	your	saints
torturing	 themselves	 for?	 Hoping	 that	 the	 more	 they	 torture	 themselves,	 the
closer	is	paradise.	And	what	does	paradise	provide?
Naked	 young	 women,	 rivers	 of	 wine,	 no	 work;	 everybody	 is	 given	 a	 harp	 ...
drink	 the	 wine,	 find	 a	 girlfriend,	 play	 on	 the	 harp,	 Alleluia!	 That's	 all	 that	 is
happening	in	paradise.
And	I	say	to	you	that	your	saints	will	look	very	hilarious.	Here	they	have	been
torturing	 themselves,	 they	 have	 become	 ugly,	 rotten.	 And	 those	 girlfriends	 in
heaven	are	plastic,	because	 they	have	been	serving	since	eternity.	 I	have	never
heard	that	anybody	goes	into	retirement.	They	remain	always	stuck	at	the	age	of
sixteen.	Time	goes	on,	but	they	don't	grow	old	--	only	plastic	can	do	that.	Plastic
never	grows	old,	never	dies.

And	 the	descriptions	 in	 the	 scriptures	make	me	convinced,	because	 those	girls
don't	perspire.	Skin	 is	bound	to	perspire,	 that	 is	 its	very	 life,	 it	 is	 its	breathing.
Every	 pore	 of	 the	 skin	 is	 breathing.	 And	 there	 is	 a	 reason	 why	 it	 perspires:
perspiration	keeps	your	temperature	the	same	so	that	whether	it	is	cold	outside	or
hot	outside,	it	doesn't	matter.	Your	life	is	dependent	on	your	temperature.	From
ninety-six	 degrees	 to	 one	 hundred	 and	 eight	 --	 just	 twelve	 degrees	 is	 your
lifespan.	 If	 you	 go	 beyond	 one	 hundred	 and	 eight,	 you	 have	 gone	 beyond.
Perspiration	keeps	you	below	that	level,	because	it	keeps	the	heat	engaged	--	the
perspiration	 becomes	 evaporated,	 so	 the	 heat	 becomes	 engaged	 in	 evaporating
the	perspiration	and	forgets	you	completely.	It	is	a	miracle.
When	 it	 is	 cold,	 you	 start	 shivering,	 even	 your	 teeth	 start	 chattering.	 Do	 you
know	what	for?	This	is	all	to	keep	you	warm.
I	have	heard	stories	 --	 I	don't	believe	 them	--	 that	people	will	 leave	 their	 false
teeth	 in	 the	 bathroom,	 and	 in	 the	 cold	 those	 teeth,	 out	 of	 old	 habit,	 start
chattering.	 I	 don't	 know	 ...	 but	 there	 are	 stories	 on	 record.	Perhaps	 just	 an	old
habit	...
Your	 shivering	keeps	you	warm.	Otherwise	your	 temperature	will	 fall	 and	 that
will	be	again	death.	Your	lifespan	is	just	within	those	twelve	degrees.
Now	 those	 beautiful	 ladies	 in	 paradise	 never	 grow	 old,	 they	 always	 remain
young.	I	cannot	conceive	that	they	have	been	serving	all	the	saints	for	millions
of	 years,	 and	 still	 nobody	 calls	 them	 prostitutes!	 They	 are	 the	 only	 eternal
prostitutes.	And	these	saints	are	dreaming	about	them.	Here	it	is	prohibited,	you
cannot	drink	wine;	it	is	a	sin	according	to	many	religions.	But	the	same	religions
provide	rivers	of	wine	--	there	is	no	need	to	drink,	you	can	drown!	Here,	every
religion	goes	on	working	on	every	child:	"Do	something;	otherwise	you	will	be	a
hobo."
And	what	are	all	your	saints	doing	in	paradise?	--	hobos,	playing	on	their	harps.
Hippies	were	simply	imitating	your	saints	in	paradise,	playing	their	guitars	and
doing	nothing.
It	 is	 such	 a	 boredom	 to	 conceive	 that	 for	 millions	 of	 years	 you	 will	 be	 just
playing	on	your	harp.	There	is	nothing	else	to	do.	You	can	have	as	many	women
as	you	want,	you	can	drink	as	much	alcohol	as	you	want.	Perhaps	to	make	it	up-
to-date,	God	may	have	provided	new	drugs
--	LSD,	heroin,	hashish	--	because	 the	saints	have	earned	 them	by	 their	virtue;
this	is	their	reward.
A	genuine	search	is	not	for	any	reward.	It	is	just	to	know	who	I	am,	why	I	am,
what	I	am.
It	is	a	pure	search	to	be	acquainted	with	oneself,	because	that	is	the	only	way	to
find	some	connection	with	the	universal	spirit.
Nensho	has	a	beautiful	metaphor.	He	says,	"All	these	saints,	what	they	are	doing
in	 declaring	 their	 saintliness	 is	 like	 lifting	 a	 hand	 with	 a	 stone	 lantern,
announcing	daybreak."
But	 all	 over,	 there	 is	 darkness.	 It	 is	 not	 daybreak.	 These	 saints	 are	 just	 stone
lanterns,	they	are	not	the	sunrise.
And	 the	 universe	 smiles	 at	 these	 fools:	 the	 void,	 the	 immense	 void,	 nods	 its
enormous	head,	smiling.

OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,

WHATEVER	HAS	BEEN	AND	SIMPLY	LIVE	ONE	MOMENT	AT	A	TIME	--
WHAT
WOULD	THAT	ONE	WORD	BE?
Maneesha,	that	one	word	is	in.	Just	in.
Go	in	and	all	the	mysteries	open	before	you.
But	before	you	go	in	...	because	nobody	knows	whether	you	will	return	or	not.	It
is	a	miracle	that	everybody	returns	every	day.	What	more	miracles	do	you	want?
Jesus	raised	only	one	man	from	death.	I	have	to	do	double	the	work!	First	I	have

work	has	to	be	done	to	bring	you	back	to	life.	And	the	miracle	is,	you	all	come
back!	Not	a	single	one	is	left	behind.
So	before	that	 inward	journey	--	 the	dangerous	journey,	as	one	may	not	 like	to
come	back
--	 a	 few	 laughs	are	necessary.	So	on	your	 inner	 journey	you	go	 laughing	 ...	 at

ENO	 ADDED:	 GOOD	 FRIENDS,	 HOW	 THEN	 ARE	 MEDITATION	 AND

ALIKE?	THEY	ARE	LIKE	THE	LAMP	AND	THE	LIGHT	IT	GIVES	FORTH.
IF	THERE
IS	 A	 LAMP	 THERE	 IS	 LIGHT;	 IF	 THERE	 IS	 NO	 LAMP	 THERE	 IS	 NO

THEY	ARE
NOT	TWO.	MEDITATION	AND	WISDOM	ARE	ALSO	LIKE	THIS.
Maneesha,	 the	 understanding	 of	mind	 ultimately	 ends	 in	 the	 understanding	 of
meditation.
The	function	of	the	mind	is	to	divide	things.	Duality	is	its	territory:	darkness	and
light,	 life	 and	 death.	 The	 mind	 cannot	 conceive	 anything	 which	 has	 not	 its
opposite.
But	existence	is	not	obliged	to	function	according	to	the	mind.	In	existence	day
and	 night	merge	 into	 each	 other,	 every	 evening,	 every	morning.	 They	 are	 not
separate.	Neither	are	 life	and	death	separate.	 If	 they	were	separate	 it	would	be
possible	 for	 someone	 to	 go	 on	 living,	 and	 not	 to	 allow	death	 to	 enter	 into	 his
house.
Osho	-	The	Miracle
129
Chapter	10	-	Sun	and	moon	in	one's	sleeve
An	ancient	Chinese	story	will	help	you	to	understand	the	great	Zen	master	Eno.
His	every	statement	is	a	scripture	in	itself.
The	ancient	story	is	that	a	great	emperor,	being	afraid	of	death,	created	a	palace
with	a	single	door.	No	other	doors,	no	other	windows,	no	way	of	entering	 into
the	palace	except	from	one	small	door	where	he	had	placed	a	complete	row	of
guards.	Guard	number	one	was	to	be	guarded	by	number	two,	and	guard	number
two	 was	 guarded	 by	 number	 three,	 and	 guard	 number	 three	 was	 guarded	 by
number	 four	 ...	 seven	 guards	 watching	 each	 other!	 More	 protection	 is	 not
possible.
A	neighboring	king	heard	about	it,	and	he	wanted	to	see	this	most	secure	palace.
He	was	welcomed.	 The	 owner	 of	 the	 palace	 took	 him	 in,	 showed	 him	 all	 the
facilities	inside,	that	there	was	no	way	for	any	enemy,	for	any	thief,	for	any	killer
to	enter.
The	king	was	very	much	impressed.	He	said,	"I	will	immediately	order	the	same.
Just	give	me	the	names	of	the	architects,	to	make	the	same	palace	for	me	in	my
kingdom."
Talking	 with	 each	 other,	 they	 came	 out	 to	 where	 the	 chariot	 of	 the	 king	 was
waiting.	And	when	he	said,	"I'm	going	to	make	exactly	the	same	palace.	I	loved
it,	 the	 very	 idea.	 It	 is	 so	 safe	 and	 secure	 ..."	 a	 beggar	 by	 the	 side	 of	 the	 road
started	laughing	madly.
Both	were	stunned.	For	a	moment	there	was	silence.
They	both	asked	the	beggar,	"Why	are	you	laughing?"
He	 said,	 "I'm	 laughing	 because	 there	 is	 a	 loophole	 in	 all	 this,	 and	 I	 know	 the
loophole.	 I	 have	 been	 sitting	 in	 this	 place	 for	 years,	 begging,	 so	 I	 have	 been
watching	the	building	of	the	palace."
The	emperor	asked,	"What	is	the	loophole?"
He	said,	"That	one	door!"
The	 emperor	 laughed.	 He	 said,	 "I	 have	 placed	 seven	 guards	 on	 it.	 They	 are
guarding	on	each	other,	nobody	can	betray.	What	is	the	fear?"
The	beggar	said,	"With	due	respect,	I	want	to	tell	you	that	death	will	enter	and
your	 guards	will	 not	 be	 able	 to	 see	 it.	And	 death	 is	 the	 only	 insecurity.	What
else?	Do	you	have	any	protection	against	death?"
The	emperor	was	at	a	loss.
The	beggar	said,	"My	suggestion	is	that	if	you	want	really	to	be	secure,	tell	your
builders	to	raise	a	wall	in	place	of	that	door!	I	still	cannot	guarantee	that	death
will	not	enter	--	but	at	least	you	have	made	as	much	effort	as	possible;	close	the
door	and	be	inside."
The	emperor	said,	"But	that	means	I'm	already	dead!	It	becomes	a	grave,	not	a
palace,	if	I	cannot	come	out."
The	beggar	said,	"If	you	think	just	by	closing	one	door	your	life	will	be	finished,
don't	you	 think	 that	by	closing	other	doors,	parts	of	your	 life	are	 finished?	By
closing	the	windows,	other	parts	of	your	life	are	finished?	You	are	going	to	live
at	the	minimum,	while	the	maximum	was	available."
Both	the	kings	were	surprised	to	see	 the	 intelligence	of	 the	beggar.	They	came
close	to	him	and	they	asked	him,	"From	where	have	you	come?"
Osho	-	The	Miracle
130
Chapter	10	-	Sun	and	moon	in	one's	sleeve
He	 said,	 "You	will	 not	 understand.	Your	 fathers	were	my	 friends.	Once	 I	 also
used	to	be	an	emperor.	But	seeing	the	whole	unnecessary	trouble,	I	made	myself
completely	secure	--	I	dropped	all	walls,	all	worries,	opened	all	windows.	Now
for	almost	half	a	century	nobody	has	harmed	me.	I'm	just	a	beggar	--	why	should
anyone	 harm	 me?	 I	 have	 nothing	 to	 be	 stolen.	 I	 sleep	 as	 I	 have	 never	 slept
before."
If	you	really	want	to	be	living	at	the	maximum,	don't	listen	to	the	duality	of	the
mind.
The	only	security	in	existence	is	going	beyond	the	mind.
The	beggar	was	a	great	Taoist	master.	His	name	was	Lieh	Tzu.	But	people	had
forgotten	that	fifty	years	before	he	had	dropped	his	kingdom.
He	 said,	 "The	 only	 security	 I	 have	 found	 is	 in	 being	 silent,	 in	 being	 myself,
where	 all	 duality	 disappears.	Where	 you	 and	 the	 universe	 are	 one,	 then	 death
cannot	do	anything."
You	have	disappeared	on	your	own	accord;	now	 there	 is	no	way	 to	harm	you.
There	is	nobody	to	harm	you.	The	body	is	not	you,	the	mind	is	not	you.	You	are
just	a	guest	in	a	house.
Don't	get	identified	with	the	house,	just	remember	the	guest.
This	statement	of	Eno	is	tremendously	beautiful:
GOOD	 FRIENDS,	 MY	 TEACHING	 OF	 THE	 DHARMA	 TAKES
MEDITATION	AND
WISDOM	AS	ITS	BASIS.	NEVER	UNDER	ANY	CIRCUMSTANCES	SAY
MISTAKENLY	 THAT	 MEDITATION	 AND	 WISDOM	 ARE	 DIFFERENT;
THEY	ARE	A	UNITY,	NOT	TWO	THINGS.
But	 all	 the	 so-called	 intelligent	 people	 of	 the	 world	 have	 taken	 them	 as	 two
things.
Meditation	is	for	the	mystics	and	wisdom	comes	from	accumulating	knowledge
from	 the	 scriptures,	 from	 the	 old	 traditions.	 They	 have	 degraded	 wisdom	 to
knowledge	--	borrowed	knowledge.
Eno	is	saying	that	wisdom	is	the	fragrance	of	meditation;	they	are	not	separable.
You	 cannot	 have	wisdom	without	meditation	 and	 you	 cannot	 have	meditation
without	wisdom.	In	fact,	they	are	two	names	for	one	phenomenon.
To	 be	 yourself,	 silently	 and	 fully	 aware,	 is	 to	 know	 without	 any	 doubt	 that
meditation	and	wisdom	are	one.
Meditation	 is	 the	 source	 and	 wisdom	 is	 the	 radiation.	 Meditation	 is	 your
understanding	 and	 wisdom	 is	 your	 action	 according	 to	 that	 understanding.
Meditation	is	your	inner	experience	and	wisdom	is	its	outer	expression.
A	man	of	meditation	cannot	do	anything	wrong.	And	a	man	of	so-called	wisdom
alone	is	 just	a	parrot.	He	goes	on	repeating,	but	his	heart	 is	not	 touched	by	his
own	repetitions.
A	 priest	 had	 two	 parrots.	 They	were	 very	 good,	 saintly,	 with	 their	 rosaries	 in
their	hands,	repeating	Ave	Maria.	But	once	in	a	while	they	would	become	very
sad,	 both	 of	 them	 at	 the	 same	 time.	 So	 he	 thought	 perhaps	 they	 needed	 a
companion.
He	went	to	the	pet	shop,	thinking	certainly	they	need	a	companion,	because	both
are	male;	they	need	a	female	at	least	to	share	with.	So	he	bought	a	female,	and	as
he	put	the	female	Osho	-	The	Miracle
131
Chapter	10	-	Sun	and	moon	in	one's	sleeve
parrot	into	their	cage,	one	parrot	said	to	the	other,	"Johnny,	now	drop	the	rosary!
There	is	no	need	of	it,	our	prayers	have	been	heard!"
The	 priest	 could	 not	 believe	 that	 these	 idiots	 had	 been	 praying	 for	 their	 own
reasons,	not	for	the	Christian	religion.	They	both	dropped	their	rosaries.
A	 man	 who	 thinks	 that	 through	 borrowed	 knowledge	 he	 is	 wise,	 is	 not	 only
befooling	himself	but	others	also.	His	wisdom	is	just	a	memory,	not	a	knowing,
because	knowing	blossoms	only	through	meditation.
Eno	says:
NEVER	UNDER	ANY	CIRCUMSTANCES	SAY	MISTAKENLY	THAT
MEDITATION	 AND	 WISDOM	 ARE	 DIFFERENT;	 THEY	 ARE	 A	 UNITY,
NOT	TWO

ENO	ADDED:
GOOD	FRIENDS,	HOW	THEN	ARE	MEDITATION	AND	WISDOM	ALIKE?
THEY
ARE	LIKE	THE	LAMP	AND	THE	LIGHT	IT	GIVES	FORTH.	IF	THERE	IS	A

THUS,	 ALTHOUGH	 THEY	HAVE	 TWO	NAMES,	 IN	 SUBSTANCE	 THEY
ARE	NOT	TWO.
MEDITATION	AND	WISDOM	ARE	ALSO	LIKE	THIS.
Eno	is	making	a	significant	statement.	You	are	standing	on	a	road	--	inwards	is
the	realm	of	meditation.	And	if	you	reach	to	the	point	where	you	touch	your	very
being,	 then	 outwardly	 you	 can	 express	 your	meditation	 in	 everything	 that	 you
do.	All	your	gestures,	all	your	actions,	even	your	silences	--	not	doing	anything,
just	sitting	--	will	also	express	the	radiance,	the	fragrance,	the	beauty,	the	joy	of
meditation.	This	is	wisdom.
But	people	have	been	misled	by	parents,	by	teachers,	by	priests,	by	everyone,	to
accumulate	wisdom.	You	can	accumulate	great	wisdom	and	yet	you	will	be	just	a
learned	Osho	-	The	Miracle
132
Chapter	10	-	Sun	and	moon	in	one's	sleeve
idiot.	Your	behavior	will	show	it,	your	actions	will	show	it;	just	your	words	will
be	in	consonance	with	the	scriptures.
The	authentic	wisdom	does	not	come	from	outside.	The	authentic	wisdom	comes
when	you	have	gone	deeper	into	your	being	and	found	the	center	of	your	life	--
then	suddenly	an	explosion.	Everything	 that	you	do	or	don't	do	expresses	your
wisdom.
Wisdom	is	just	the	fragrance	of	a	rose.	Find	the	rose	first	and	the	fragrance	will
be	 found	 on	 its	 own	 accord.	Don't	 even	make	 the	 distinction	 of	which	 comes
first,	 because	 they	are	not	 two.	They	are	one,	 looked	at	 from	 two	 sides	 --	one
from	inside	and	one	from	outside.
Whatever	 is	 your	 enlightenment	 expresses	 itself	 inside	 as	 meditation,	 and
outside	as	wisdom.
Neither	comes	first,	they	are	one.	The	outer	and	the	inner	both	are	together.
But	mind	always	creates	distinctions,	separations.	And	it	is	because	of	the	mind
that	 you	 get	 into	 unnecessary	 troubles:	 philosophic	 conflicts,	 theological
arguments.	You	waste	your	time	on	books	looking	for	something	that	may	help
you	to	find	yourself.
You	 cannot	 find,	 anywhere,	 anything	 that	 will	 help	 you	 to	 find	 yourself.	 You
have	to	be	clear	about	it:	you	are	not	to	be	found,	you	are	already	here.	You	have
just	to	recognize	the	fact.
A	master	does	not	teach	you	to	be	yourself;	he	simply	makes	you	recognize	what
is	hidden	behind	your	heartbeat.	In	his	presence	a	certain	synchronicity	happens.
You	simply	be	close	to	a	master,	silently,	and	you	start	feeling	a	rush	of	energy
flowing	towards	you,	making	you	afire.	It	is	invisible	to	the	spectators;	only	the
participants	are	the	blessed	ones.
Once	 you	 know	 yourself,	 you	 are	 in	 meditation	 and	 your	 actions	 will	 show
wisdom.
A	Zen	poet	wrote:
TO	HAVE	THE	SUN	AND	MOON	IN	ONE'S	SLEEVE;
TO	HOLD	THE	UNIVERSE
IN	THE	PALM	OF	ONE'S	HAND.
And	his	haiku	is	complete.	Just	remember	one	hand,	just	remember	one	sleeve.
TO	HAVE	THE	SUN	AND	MOON	IN	ONE'S	SLEEVE,
TO	HOLD	THE	UNIVERSE
IN	THE	PALM	OF	ONE'S	HAND.
When	you	open	your	hand,	don't	you	have	the	whole	universe	in	your	palm?	Just
don't	close	it.	The	closed	hand	is	the	poorest;	it	has	nothing	in	it.
It	is	a	strange	thing,	that	every	child	is	born	with	a	closed	hand,	and	everybody
dies	with	an	open	hand.	It	has	never	been	heard	of	that	anybody	has	died	with	a
closed	hand,	because	to	close	the	hand	you	need	energy.	The	open	hand	needs	no
energy,	no	tension.	A	closed	hand	will	get	tired.	The	dying	man	cannot	afford	the
energy	to	close	his	fist.
But	it	is	beautiful	to	go	deeper	into	the	question	of	why	every	child	is	born	with
closed	 hands.	 It	 signifies	 that	 every	 child	 is	 born	 with	 great	 hopes	 and
expectations	and	desires.
Those	closed	hands	are	showing	that	he	has	to	make	something	of	himself	--	to
be	successful,	Osho	-	The	Miracle
133
Chapter	10	-	Sun	and	moon	in	one's	sleeve
rich,	politically	powerful.	 It	 is	 an	unconscious,	 very	deep-rooted	 expression	of
his	being.	He	comes	into	the	world	with	great	secrets;	soon	he	will	start	getting
frustrated.	No	success	succeeds.
In	fact,	every	success	ends	up	in	failure,	in	a	deep	frustration,	because	what	you
wanted	is	not	found.
The	old	man	dying	has	nothing	 to	hold	on	 to.	No	desire,	no	expectation	 ...	 he
moves	into	death	just	like	a	beggar.
When	Alexander	the	Great	died,	he	told	his	ministers,	"Keep	my	hands	hanging
outside	of	the	coffin."
They	 said,	 "Strange	 idea!"	 It	had	never	been	heard	of.	Nobody	had	done	 it.	A
dead	man	should	behave	and	keep	his	hands	inside	the	coffin.
But	Alexander	said,	"It	is	my	order	and	it	has	to	be	fulfilled!	It	is	my	last	wish.	It
does	not	matter	that	nobody	else	has	done	it;	it's	going	to	be	done	to	me.	Keep
my	hands	hanging	outside	the	casket!"
They	said,	"But	why	this	idea?"
Alexander	said,	"Millions	of	people	will	come	to	see.	I	want	to	make	it	clear	to
them	 that	 I	had	come	 into	 the	world	with	closed	 fists,	with	great	expectations,
with	 great	 secret	 desires	 --	 I	 am	 going	 from	 the	world	 utterly	 frustrated,	with
open	hands.	I'm	not	taking	anything	with	me.
All	that	I	had	has	proved	to	be	just	a	delusion."
Meditation	 makes	 you	 an	 open	 hand.	 Mind	 is	 very	 secretive;	 mind	 goes	 on
keeping	your	desires,	your	angers,	your	frustrations,	your	miseries,	all	secret	--	a
closed	fist.	Meditation	is	an	opening	of	the	fist.	And	then	the	whole	universe	is
in	your	hands.	A	small	haiku	with	a	great	meaning	...
Ikkyu	wrote:
SHOULD	YOU	SEEK
THE	WAY	OF	THE	BUDDHA
ALL	NIGHT	LONG,
SEARCHING,	YOU	WILL	ENTER
INTO	YOUR	OWN	MIND.
You	 can	 go	 on	 searching	 not	 only	 the	 whole	 night	 but	 the	 whole	 life	 of
unconsciousness	 and	 darkness,	 searching	 for	Buddha.	You	will	 always	 end	 up
with	your	mind.
You	will	not	find	the	buddha	because	the	buddha	is	not	to	be	found	by	searching.
The	buddha	has	to	be	simply	recognized.	Without	making	any	effort	to	seek	and
search,	just	look	in.	You	are	the	buddha.
And	immediately	all	your	actions,	all	your	ways	of	life,	all	your	functions,	will
change	--
immediately.	They	will	all	carry	the	fragrance	of	a	buddha.

The	light	within	you	is	perfect.	You	cannot	take	anything	out	of	it,	nor	can	you
add	anything	to	it.	It	is	a	perfect	circle,	it	is	a	perfectly	opened	lotus.	You	cannot
do	anything	to	it;	you	can	only	rejoice.	You	can	dance,	you	can	sing	a	song,	in
praise	of	the	lotus	that	has	blossomed	within	your	being.
Particularly,	I	want	my	people	to	know	that	meditation	is	not	just	being	silent	--
that	is	only	one	part	of	it.	Finally,	it	has	to	be	creative.	And	when	a	poetry	comes
out	of	your	inner	silences,	or	a	painting,	it	has	a	flavor	which	is	not	of	this	world.
Question	1
Maneesha	has	asked:
OUR	BELOVED	MASTER,
WHEN	YOU	SAY	EACH	EVENING	DURING	THE	MEDITATION,	"GO	IN,
GO
DEEPER	 AND	 DEEPER	 LIKE	 AN	 ARROW	 TO	 YOUR	 CENTER,"	 IS	 IT
THAT	THERE	IS
ACTUALLY	 NOWHERE	 TO	 GO	 AND	 NOTHING	 TO	 DO	 BECAUSE	WE
ARE
ALREADY	IN?
IS	 ALL	 WE	 CAN	 DO	 JUST	 BE	 AWARE	 OF	 HOW	 AND	 WHEN	 WE
PERPETUALLY
GO	OUT,	FURTHER	AND	FURTHER	FROM	OURSELVES?
Yes,	 Maneesha.	 There	 is	 nowhere	 to	 go.	 You	 are	 already	 there,	 where	 you
needed	to	be.
And	once	you	recognize	it,	then	you	carry	your	consciousness	wherever	you	go.
Then	time	makes	no	difference,	nor	does	space.	You	are	a	buddha	in	the	temple
and	 you	 are	 a	 buddha	 in	 the	 shop;	 you	 are	 a	 buddha	 sitting	 silently,	 deep	 in
meditation,	 and	you	are	 a	buddha	having	a	good	 laugh	with	Sardar	Gurudayal
Singh.
It	 is	midnight	 in	Miami,	and	Glamorous	Gladys	arrives	for	a	winter	holiday	 to
find	that	all	the	hotels	are	full.
The	receptionist	at	the	four-star	Screwing	Sands	Hotel	suggests	that	he	can	put
her	 in	 to	 share	 a	 room	 with	 a	 nice	 man	 on	 the	 fifth	 floor,	 named	 Donald
Dickstein.
Gladys	likes	the	idea	and	takes	the	room.
She	enters	the	room	quietly,	takes	a	peek,	and	sees	Donald	sleeping	in	one	of	the
beds.
Then	she	turns	on	the	bathroom	light,	leaves	the	door	open,	and	begins	to	slowly
and	seductively	take	off	her	dress.

Then	 she	 ever	 so	 slowly	 removes	 her	 bra.	Bending	 in	 the	 light,	 she	 takes	 her
sweet	time	slipping	off	her	black	lace	panties.
Finally,	she	saunters	around	the	room	completely	naked,	and	gets	 into	her	bed.
Then	 she	 leans	over	 and	whispers	 to	Donald,	 "Would	you	 like	 to	 come	 in	my
bed?"
"No	thanks,"	replies	Donald,	wide	awake.	"I've	already	come	in	mine!"
There	 is	 an	 explosion	 at	 a	 Polack	 salami	 factory,	 and	 one	 of	 the	 salamis	 gets
blown	right	to	heaven.	It	lands	at	Saint	Peter's	feet.
"What	 a	 funny-looking	 thing,"	 says	Saint	Peter,	 picking	 it	 up.	And	he	goes	 to
show	it	to	Jesus.
"Did	you	ever	see	such	a	thing?"	Saint	Peter	asks	Jesus.
"No,"	replies	Jesus.	"I've	never	seen	one	before."	So,	Saint	Peter	takes	it	to	show
to	Mary.
"Mary,"	he	asks,	"did	you	ever	see	something	like	this?"
"Oh!"	 exclaims	Mary.	 "You	 know,	 if	 it	 didn't	 have	 that	 funny	 smell,	 I	 would
swear	it	was	the	Holy	Ghost!"
Caroline	 Kratz	 goes	 to	 visit	 her	 local	 channeler	 to	 find	 out	 about	 her	 late
husband,	Caruso.
"What's	 it	 like	 up	 there?"	 asks	 Caroline,	 anxiously,	 when	 she	 gets	 the	 right
channel.
"Marvellous!"	replies	Caruso.	"I	get	up	late,	go	swimming,	then	have	sex,	sleep,
eat,	take	a	rest,	go	swimming,	have	sex,	sleep,	eat	again,	have	sex	..."
"Ah!"	cries	Caroline,	"but	down	here	you	only	made	love	to	me	once	a	month!"
"I	know,"	admits	Caruso,	"but	down	there	I	was	not	a	duck!"
Old	 Rubenstein	 is	 passing	 the	 local	 pet	 shop	 one	 day,	 when	 he	 sees	 a	 sign
advertising	a	parrot	that	can	speak	many	languages.
Since	he	considers	himself	an	expert	on	languages,	Rubenstein	goes	inside	and
starts	to	question	the	parrot.
"Parlez-vous	francais?"	asks	Rubenstein.
"Parlez-vous	francais?"	replies	the	parrot.
"Habla	espanol?"	asks	the	old	Jew.
"Habla	espanol?"	comes	the	reply.
"Speak	English?"	asks	Rubenstein.
"Speak	English?"	replies	the	bird.
Old	Rubenstein	goes	closer	to	the	parrot,	and	asks	confidentially,	"Tell	me,	my
friend,	if	you	are	so	smart,	do	you	speak	Yiddish?"
The	parrot	fixes	Rubenstein	with	its	beady	eyes:	"Tell	me,	my	friend,"	says	the
bird,	"you	think	I	should	not	speak	Yiddish	with	a	nose	like	this?"

Okay,	Nivedano	...

(Gibberish)
Nivedano	...
(Drumbeat)
Be	silent	...
Close	your	eyes.
Feel	your	body	to	be	frozen.
Gather	all	your	energy	inside.
Deeper	and	deeper	...
Take	this	energy
to	the	very	center	of	your	being.
Your	body	is	only	a	circumference.
Find	the	center	of	your	consciousness.
Once	you	have	found	the	center
of	your	consciousness,
you	are	a	miracle,	a	buddha	...
the	greatest	mystery	in	existence.
Don't	hesitate	...
Take	the	jump.
There	is	nothing	to	fear.
It	is	your	own	world.
Finding	the	center	of	your	consciousness
is	finding	the	center	of	the	universe	itself.
After	that,
you	exist	spontaneously	--
without	any	effort,
with	great	grace	and	bliss.

Meditation	ultimately	brings	wisdom
to	your	life.
To	make	it	absolutely	clear	that	you	are	not	the	body,	Nivedano	...
(Drumbeat)
Relax	...	fall	dead.
Collect	yourself	as	deep
within	your	innermost	core	as	possible	...
You	are	discovering	the	buddha	...
This	moment	is	the	most	precious	moment
when	one	discovers	the	buddha	in	oneself.
Then	all	theology	and	religion	and	philosophy
are	just	commentaries,
non-essential.
You	have	got	the	essential	thing
right	in	your	hands.
This	buddha-nature	knows	no	death,	no	birth	--
it	knows	only	eternity.
No	beginning,	no	end.
No	boundary.
It	becomes	oceanic	...
The	whole	universe	becomes	its	home.
For	the	first	time
there	is	not	even	a	fence
between	you	and	the	universe.
You	are	the	universe.
This	is	the	meaning	of	finding	the	buddha.
Nivedano	...

Come	back,	slowly,	silently,	gracefully,
carrying	the	experience,
recollecting	it.
Sit	for	a	few	moments	as	a	buddha.
And	carry	out
your	twenty-four-hour	activities,
remembering	that	you	are	a	buddha
and	all	your	expressions	should	be	of	wisdom.
Okay,	Maneesha?
Yes,	Beloved	Master.
Can	we	celebrate	the	ten	thousand	buddhas?
Yes,	Beloved	Master!
