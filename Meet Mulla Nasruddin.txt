himself and that ’Bon appetit’ meant ”Good appetite”, or ”I hope that you enjoy your meal!”

CHAPTER 1.
”Funny you have not been to see me before!” the doctor barked at Mulla Nasrudin. ”Have you
consulted any other doctor about your condition?”
”No, Sir,” stammered the Mulla. ”Only the chemist.”
”Good Heavens, man,” snorted the doctor, ’Have no sense? This just shows how stupid people can
be! The chemist is not medically qualified – you had right to consult him! And what nonsense did he
tell you?”
”HE TOLD ME TO COME AND SEE YOU,” said Nasrudin.
74.
Mulla Nasrudin visited the doctor to complain of insomnia.
”Don’t you sleep at all in the night?” asked the doctor.
”Oh, I sleep like a top at night,” admitted the Mulla, ”and I sleep fairly soundly during the mornings.
BUT I OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTY DROPPING OFF IN THE AFTERNOONS.”
75.
Doctor: ”Was that slimming diet I recommended to your wife satisfactory?”
Mulla Nasrudin: ”VERY. THREE WEEKS AGO SHE DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY!”
76.
”What are you reading?” asked the prison librarian.
”NOTHING MUCH,” replied Mulla Nasrudin, the prisoner. ”JUST THE USUAL ESCAPE
LITERATURE.”
77.
”Hi, Mulla,” greeted a friend. ”How is your wife?”
”COMPARED TO WHAT?” responded Mulla Nasrudin.
78.
”My wife is an angel Mulla.”
”LUCKY YOU,” said Mulla Nasrudin. ”MINE IS STILL ALIVE.”
79.
”I understand that your wife converted you to religion, Mulla?”

CHAPTER 1.
”OH, YES,” said Mulla nasrudin. ”I DIDN’T BELIEVE IN HELL UNTIL I MARRIED HER.”
80.
”I think my wife is slowly going insane,” confided Mulla Nasrudin to the psychiatrist.
”Well, what do you want me to do about it?” asked the headshrinker.
”I WONDERED lF YOU COULD SUGGEST ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT SPEED UP THE
PROCESS,” said the Mulla casually.
81.
After an intensive initial interview with Mulla Nasrudin, a psychiatrist have a written list of instructions
and a weekly appointment card. A fortnight later he telephoned to the Mulla to enquire why he had
failed to keep the next appointment.
”WHY. DOCTOR,” protested Nasrudin, ”YOUR INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED ONE THAT SAID I HAD
TO AVOID PEOPLE WHO IRRITATED ME!”
82.
A woman met Mulla Nasrudin, an old friend, at her psychiatrist’s door.
”What a coincidence!” she cried. ”We must have a cup of tea together! Tell me, are you coming or
going?”
”IF I KNEW THAT,” replied Nasrudin somberly, ”I WOULD NOT BE HERE, WOULD I?”
83.
Mulla Nasrudin was attempting to smuggle a jar of whiskey across the border of his country. When
asked what the jar contained, he said, ”Holy Water.”
The Customs officer insisted on opening it and taking a sniff.
Good God, man, this is whiskey! he said
”SAINTS BE PRAISED!” cried the Mulla. ”A MIRACLE!”
84.
Mulla Nasrudin was trying to describe his symptoms to an impatient physician.
”It’s a sort of jabbing pain in my right shoulder. Doctor. I get it when I lean forward, stretch out one
arm, then the other, raise my elbows, hunch my shoulders and then stand straight up.”
”Is that so?” said the doctor, sneering, ”I don’t suppose it has occurred to you that you could avoid
this mysterious pain simply by not carrying out such an absurd series of movements.”

CHAPTER 1.
”It did occur to me, Doctor,” the Mulla assured him earnestly. ”BUT I COULD NOT THINK OF ANY
OTHER WAY OF GETTING INTO MY OVERCOAT.”
85.
Mulla Nasrudin was told by his doctor to cut out drink.
”I can’t cut it out just like that, Doctor!” wailed the Mulla ”It would kill me.”
”Hmmm.... you have probably got something there said the doctor. ”We will compromise then, and
do it gradually.
For the next week you can drink four double scotches a day. No more. The following week we will
cut it down to three, and the week-after down to two.
Nasrudin staggered off and was back in a week, absolutely blotto.
”What do you think you are playing at?” demanded the doctor. ”I told you to cut down to four double
scotches a day.”
”I did Doctor, honestly,” said the Mulla.
”Well, how is it that you are in this dreadful inebriated condition?”
”Well Doctor, it’s like this,” said Nasrudin. ”After I left you last week, I called on another doctor down
the road for a second opinion, AND HE PRESCRIBED THE SAME TREATMENT.....”
86.
A preacher was giving a sermon on the dangers of drinking and driving.
”Remember, my friends,” he said to the assembled congregation, ”whiskey and petrol don’t mix.”
”They do,” muttered Mulla Nasrudin at the back of the mosque to his neighbour, ”BUT THEY TASTE
AWFUL.”
87.
Mulla Nasrudin, a castaway, was washed ashore after many days on the open sea. The island on
which he landed was populated by savage cannibals who tied him, dazed and exhausted, to a thick
stake. They then proceeded to cut his arms with their spears and drink his blood. This continued for
several days until the Mulla could no longer stand it. He called the cannibal king and said, ”You can
kill me, but this torture with the spears has got to stop. DAMMIT, I AM TIRED OF BEING STUCK
FOR THE DRINKS.”
88.
”Is there any reason why the board should not draft you into the army, Mulla?”

CHAPTER 1.
”Yes, I have defective eyesight,” said Mulla Nasrudin.
”Are you able to substantiate that claim?”
”WELL – HERE’S A PHOTOGRAPH OF MY WIFE.”
89.
Mulla nasrudin rushed into a pub and said, ”Quick.... gimme a treble whiskey and two pints of the
best bitter! I must have a drink before the trouble starts!”
The startled barman hastily poured the drinks which the Mulla downed in a trice.
”Now then,” said the barman, ”what’s all this about? When is the trouble going to start?”
”RIGHT NOW!” answered Nasrudin. ”I CAN’T PAY FOR MY DRINKS!”
90.
”Father, I want to get married,” announced Mulla Nasrudin’s son one morning.
”No, my boy, you are not wise enough,” said the Mulla.
”When will I be wise enough?” asked the lad.
”WHEN YOU GET RID OF THE IDEA THAT YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED,” said Nasrudin.
91.
When old Mulla Nasrudin was asked why he talked to himself, he replied: ”IT IS BECAUSE IN THE
FIRST PLACE, I LIKE TO TALK TO A SMART MAN, AND IN THE SECOND PLACE, BECAUSE I
LIKE TO HEAR A SMART MAN TALK.”
92.
Mulla Nasrudin’s wife had difficulty getting to sleep and, at three o’clock in the morning, she awoke
the Mulla and said, ”Mulla, you never make love to me like you did when we got married forty years
ago.”
”Please, Darling,” answered the Mulla, ”I have got a busy day tomorrow. Go to sleep.
”But,” she persisted, ”you used to be a romantic. You used to bite me on the fingers, on my neck, on
my ears – Why don’t you do it any more?”
”Darling,” the Mulla explained wearily, ”such nonsense is for newly-weds. We are too old.”
”Just once you should bite me like you did forty years ago.”

CHAPTER 1.
”All right,’ said the Mulla, as he got out of bed yawning.
”But where are you going?” asked his wife.
”TO THE BATHROOM FOR MY TEETH,” said Nasrudin.
93.
She did not approve of smoking and when Mulla Nasrudin, the newcomer, got into the carriage and
lit his pipe, she could not help letting him know.
”Do you know that my husband is sixty years of age and he never put a pipe in his mouth?”
”M’AM,” said Nasrudin, ”I AM SIXTY-FIVE AND I NEVER PUT IT ANYWHERE ELSE.”
94.
You certainly seem in excellent health,” said the young physician to the octogenerian, Mulla
Nasrudin. ”What’s your secret?”
”I have kept off drink and women Doctor,” said the old Mulla firmly. ”Never gone out with a girl or
touched a drop in my whole life.”
Just then there was a crash and a terrified female screamed from the adjoining room.
”What on earth is that?” asked the doctor in alarm.
”THAT’LL BE FATHER CHASING THE MAID” snapped the grey-beard. ”HE’S DRUNK AGAIN!”
95.
When Mulla Nasrudin was ninety, he was asked how he had managed to have such a long life, ”I
believe,” said the Mulla, ”that it’s due to the fact that I never smoked, drank or touched a girl – UNTIL
I WAS NINE YEARS OF AGE.”
96.
”Mulla,” asked a man meeting old Mulla nasrudin, who was always carefree inspite of having had
more than his share of life’s troubles, ”how do you manage to remain so cheerful and calm?”
”WELL,” replied Nasrudin, ”I HAVE JUST LEARNED TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE INEVITABLE.”
97.
”And have you made your will, Mulla?”
”INDEED I HAVE,” said Mulla nasrudin. ”ALL OF ME FORTUNE GOES TO THE DOCTOR THAT
SAVES MY LIFE.”

CHAPTER 1.
98.
Mulla Nasrudin supervised the building of his own tomb.
At last, after one shortcoming after another had been righted, the mason came for the money.
”It is not right yet, builder,” said the Mulla.
”Whatever more can be done with it?” asked the mason.
”WE STILL HAVE TO SUPPLY THE BODY,” said Nasrudin.
99.
Before his death, Mulla Nasrudin wrote this will.
”The law prescribes that my dependents must receive certain fixed proportions of my possessions
and money.
”I HAVE NOTHING: LET THIS BE DIVIDED ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARITHMETICAL
FORMULAE OF THE LAW. THAT WHICH IS LEFT OVER IS TO BE GIVEN TO THE POOR.”
